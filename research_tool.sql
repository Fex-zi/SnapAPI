I have enjoyed this opportunity to broaden my perspective, even over such a silly question :) \nSorry I haven\'t been able to read them all, it got a bit crazy haha!\n\nHere is a summary for people like me who love to learn but may not want to navigate so many comments...\n\nI\'ve learnt that:\n- Rice is usually a lot more sticky than how it\'s made in my country (Australia) where it just falls apart. There is some agreement from chopstick-using visitors to Australia that rice here is not \"chopstickable\"\n- Cultures that use chopsticks for noodles/meat/veg do sometimes use spoons for rice dishes for convenience\n- The bowl is often lifted to mouth (which is often considered improper in Aus), and also the bowls are often smaller and rounder than what I\'m used to in Aus, making it more convenient to do this\n- Many places in Asia don\'t use chopsticks at all. In some, it is quite the norm to eat with their hands. (I think this is beautiful, I like to use my hands too but it\'s often considered rude/dirty here in Aus)\n- Some people really love to be mean for no reason...to those who said \"not everyone wants to shovel in huge amounts of food and get obese\" or similar: your assumptions are quite misplaced - I am small, a slow eater and struggle with under-eating as I often don\'t get hungry haha!! (Tangent: Now that I think about it, I guess that\'s part of what prompted the question - I already struggle to eat so I wondered, why make it harder? Lots of people pointed out that it doesn\'t need to be convenient, just slow down and enjoy - this is a lovely perspective that really didn\'t occur to me; it\'s quite interesting how my eating struggles narrowed my perspective here!)\n- Thank you to the many people who just said \"skill issue\". That was very helpful. Lol\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI know that sometimes rice is more sticky and that makes more sense. Is it more the norm for rice to be sticky in these cultures?\n\nIdk, my partner likes to use chopsticks, but whenever I try I\'m like what is the point of this I\'m getting like 5 grains per bite?? So inconvenient!\n\nOh and also I know that it\'s often not considered impolite in these cultures to lift the bowl to your mouth and shovel it in, but still that seems inconvenient to me?\n\nPlease educate me (respectfully).', 'faultyflyingfox', 'NoStupidQuestions', 'https://reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1oi5yvj/why_do_cultures_known_to_eat_a_lot_of_rice_use/', 8905, 986, '2025-10-28 16:43:11', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

That is** [GTAIVisbest](https://www.reddit.com/user/GTAIVisbest/). They posted in r/uscanadaborder\n\nThanks to u/JukeBox5877 for the rec!\n\n# Do NOT comment on Original Posts.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** &gt;!this is a very low stakes post but it has a happy ending!&lt;\n\n**Editor\'s note:** &gt;!this is very silly but it made me smile. And now you all know how to bring back obscene amounts of fish from Canada if you are ever in need.!&lt;\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscanadaborder/comments/1o28bz2/i_want_to_buy_obscene_amounts_of_canned_fish/)**: October 9, 2025**\n\nI really enjoy canned fish, and I\'ve been going completely pescetarian recently. I pretty much eat it every day. There\'s one type of canned fish sold in Canada that\'s extremely delicious and healthy, and I would eat it every single day if I could.\n\nMy GF and I plan to do a day trip across the Blaine border crossing, stay the night, hit up Costco in Vancouver and buy out their entire supply of these cans before coming back home.\n\nIt doesn\'t look like there are any agricultural restrictions on canned goods, and while it appears that Canada makes people pay duties on groceries if you go into the USA for less than 48 hours, I can\'t find any information for the reverse.\n\nWe both have NEXUS. Do we just declare \"groceries\" if we buy an entire year\'s supply of canned fish? Will it get seized? Will there be duties to pay?\n\nThanks for any help and advice you can give.\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\n**Expensive-Student732:** Going to Costco today. Care to tell me what this canned fish is?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Nah, it\'s none of the below. Gold Seal wild skinless boneless mackerel. Canned mackerel is already delicious and low in mercury but this can takes the cake. I have 2 cans in my pantry that I\'ve been rationing since last visite and I only crack them open in the event of a celebration, birthday, or wedding. Apparently Costco stocks a lot of these cans\n\n**Expensive-Student732:** Beautiful. I\'m heading down to Fredericton in half an hour. Had you lived in New England I could have brought some too you next Boston run. Im looking forward to trying them. \n\n&gt;**OOP:** Ahhh man, you\'re too kind. Thank you.  \nCanned mackerel is more meaty and IMHO has a better texture than canned sardines, although both are good. The gold seal brand is very tasty, delicious fatty omega 3 notes when I bite into the meat. Enjoy. Makes me want to break open my second to last can!\n\n**MrJmbjmb:** Depending on how much you plan on bringing back you might have a hard time convincing the agent that your are importing it for personal consumption. It may be classified as a commercial import and may require permits, special documentation and/or prior authorization. It may be a lot easier to bring back a smaller quantity and make the trip again in a few weeks/months.\n\nIf the product is made in Canada, US or Mexico it will likely qualify for duty free import under the USMCA exemption. If it\'s made in another country then you will likely have to pay duties to import it.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Looks like it\'s canned in Poland. The last thing I want to do is abandon these valuable cans for bringing too much. I\'ll declare $200 of groceries or something, but if they look at the receipt it\'ll be $200 of canned mackerel  \n*OOP replies again:*  \nEDIT: u/ longjumpingtadpole below contradicted these claims, saying that there are no tariffs if it\'s under $200 in value. Is that true? Is there a rule about the monetary value of the foods?\n\n**MrJmbjmb:** A product of Poland would be subject to a 15% tariff at the border. Canned mackerel should fall under HS code 1604.15.00.00 and is also subject to a 3% general duty at the border.\n\nOfficers have discretion to charge you or not but you should be ready to pay.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Fuck... I guess the only thing I can do is bring back a \"reasonable\" amount in a Costco haul that will only last me like 3 weeks without aggressive rationing. Thanks for the information, though\n\n**MrJmbjmb:** Yeah, 200$ is your basic exemption.\n\nBut 200$ is likely not enough if you plan of buying the entire Costco stock or bringing back 50lbs of it.\n\nIf you bring back more than 200$ then the exemption does not apply and the duty will be assessed on the actual value, not just on the part over 200$.\n\n[https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/kbyg/types-exemptions](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/kbyg/types-exemptions)\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I see, thanks for clearing that up. Yeah, $200 plus my GF is planning on buying some \"regular\" groceries too so we\'re already going to be past that. Wew\n\n*What OOP does with the canned fish:*\n\n&gt;Uncan it, lay it on a bed of rice, blast the hell out of it with a torch to get that wok hei flavor, and add some furikake seasoning, egg, chopped seaweed and avocado, with some grilled onion and bell peppers. Eat that once a day, eat nothing else, and work out/run every day. I\'ve never been this lean before and I\'m starting to see the faintest outline of abs appear which has never happened before (my bodyfat has always been a bit too high for that)\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscanadaborder/comments/1o4ytk7/update_to_i_want_to_bring_an_obscene_amount_of/)**: October 12, 2025 (3 days later)**\n\nHopefully an update post is allowed considering how incredulous people were at the nature of the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscanadaborder/comments/1o28bz2/comment/nipauia/), and the general consensus there. I\'ll explain below what happened at the border on my way back into the US.\n\n[Image](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fupdate-to-i-want-to-bring-an-obscene-amount-of-canned-fish-v0-no1nn9bnhquf1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D492%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D8c72516845f781b5b5ca31110234e9c011e03804): a shit ton of cans\n\nJACKPOT!!\n\nI drove up to BC, found that Costco did NOT stock any of this kind of canned mackerel like I suspected. Bummer. Right next door was this massive store that looked like a Fred Meyers/Walmart blend called \"Real Canadian Superstore\". I went in there kind of half-dejected being sure I wasn\'t going to find anything I wanted, and went to the canned fish section. Lo and behold, on the top shelf was a whole stack of the GOLD SEAL brand that I was searching for!\n\nI spent the next 4-5 hours going to multiple Real Canadian Superstores and Save-On-Foods in the area, buying out their entire stock of the Gold Seal cans, which was usually only 24 cans each. I think I spent around $290 USD on all these cans.\n\nFinally I had almost 100 cans accumulated, which was a huge win. This can easily last me months without significant rationing (two cans per meal, maybe having a Gold Seal meal 4 times a week and sardines or fresh fish 3 times a week, so about \\~3 months unless I taper off the OMAD canned fish diet before then, i.e only do the diet on weekdays, which would stretch this supply for months longer).\n\nWhen I came back to the border I had all the fish cans in my trunk interspersed with my luggage. The border guard asked us what we had, I told him we had \"some snacks\". He asked what kind of snacks. I told him we had bought some Korean sweets, ramen noodles, and canned fish. He asked about Alcohol which I didn\'t have, and that was that.\n\n(EDIT: because the above paragraph is causing controversy and accusations of dishonesty, let me add some additional information. I drove up with the receipts in my hand from all the stores I had visited, including non-canned-fish items I purchased. The agent didn\'t seem interested in my snacks or my canned fish and asked about any other items I had, like alcohol or commercial items. Obviously I had none of that, which is why the interaction was so straightforward. Monetary amounts (receipts) were right there in my hand if he had asked for them, I just didn\'t volunteer any extra information that wasn\'t required to answer his his question)\n\nTL;DR - Not only was crossing the border no big deal at all - and I was worrying myself for no reason -, the fish I wanted turned out to be extremely ubiquitous in Canada and easily obtainable, and I was able to get 100 cans!!!!\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\n**suitcaseismyhome:** I\'m glad that you managed to cross without incident, but \'some\' and \'snacks\' are certainly not representative of what you did have with you. I suspect that would have been challenged at any secondary inspection, or even had they taken a quick look at your items.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** If they asked more questions about my canned fish, I would have given them truthful answers. Then what? I have to pay a 15% duty if the officer decides I should? Ok, fine, I\'ll pay it. No lieing here, just not immediately blurting out \"OMG I have obscene amounts of canned fish in my trunk!!!!\" This sub always says to give truthful answers but not volunteer any additional information than what they ask for\n\n**MedialMalleous:** Hello,\n\nThis is US Border Security \n\nIf you could call us at 555-3267, that would be great\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Sorry officer, you can\'t have any!\n\n**hhxuudbbgulsnvfti:** Brother if you phone ahead to such places they\'ll put in a bulk order for you so you aren\'t emptying their shelves and you can just pick it up from the back loading dock.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I\'ll use this next time, hopefully this will come in handy for me when my current supplies run out  \n*OOP adds:*  \nThey said that they resupply daily.\n\n*To the many, many, many commenters asking about mercury levels:*\n\nCanned Atlantic mackerel like this has like 0.05 PPM of Mercury according to the FDA, it has some of the lowest amounts of mercury in any seafood. Canned sardines are even lower, but all of these are a far cry from high-mercury fish like tuna', 'LucyAriaRose', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oc2jnk/i_want_to_buy_obscene_amounts_of_canned_fish/', 4716, 658, '2025-10-21 09:35:26', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Kind of how i feel about singapore. \n\nVisited Singapore for 5 days last November. \n\nGrowing up, my only image of Singapore was that classic lion fountain by the bay. \n\nAnd when i started work, it became my favorite stopover spot because of Changi airport, which deserves all the hype. Pictures dont do it justice. The Jewel waterfall, the sky garden (but skip the maze and bouncenet = overpriced), the insane shopping mall, the massage chairs. Literally spent half a day there just wandering, eating until i felt like a bloated cow lol There’s a reason it’s been named the world’s best airport 13 years in a row.\n\nI felt that’s exact precision and pride carries through the whole country. Even if Singapore isn’t #1 in something, you can feel the drive of it. \n\nBut the wildest part is remembering that just 50–60 years ago, this place was basically a fishing village with just 2 Mil population. from third world to one of Asia’s economic powerhouses in one life time. \n\nLee Kuan Yew’s leadership definitely shaped that , equal parts admirable and intense capitalist authoitaian. It’s awe-inspiring and, honestly, a bit sad realizing how rare that kind of foresight and execution is not every world leader.  (Def cheek out the national museum of Singapore- had a lot of pictures of 60-70 years ago, crazy contrast) \n\nI had tons of fun, but every night when i was journal, Singapore gave me a weird emotional contrast. Impeccably clean, insanely efficient, incredibly fun, yet something about it felt a bit too smooth to grip onto. Does that make sense? \n\nAll that said, I had a blast. On to the gooood stuffs highlights. \n- The hawker culture and food is unmatched . Ahhh especially the Hainan Chicken Rice (海南雞飯).\n- Peranakan Museum ended up being one of my favorite stops. It’s often skipped, but the beadwork and cultural blend of Chinese and Malay and indo heritage was just beautiful\n- Haw Par Villa was hands down the quirkiest experience. Imagine an outdoor museum of Chinese mythology with a literal “hell exhibit.” Creepy and lots of accidental hilarious statues\n\nHighlights from the trip:\n\n- National Museum of Singapore, Fort Canning Park\n- the insane Orchid Garden \n- Cloud Forest + Flower Dome + Marina Bay Sands light show\n- Exploring Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam. Highlight!!  all so distinct yet harmoniously blended\n- Hawker food, Malatang from Tang Tang in Parklane Mall (I got addicted. lol)\n- Peranakan houses along Joo Chiat, The Intan, and Chijmes for coffee + tea\n- Jewel at Changi Airport— skip the hedge maze, but the sky garden is a must.\n\nThere were still quite a few things i Didn’t get to do but would loved to —&gt; Kusu Island, Sentosa, or Little Guilin this round — if anyone’s been, I’d love to hear your thoughts. \n\n(Edit. Love all the additional rec. Pulau Ubin and Windsor Nature Park look so awesome. Thank you. Also want to make it clear, I was wrong about the timeline around singapore development.

I did have duckweed for a short time, but it didn\'t take. \n\nIt used to be all gravel with my first crawfish, but I decided to sand cap the gravel before the second one. I\'ve had the same mosquito fish in here since 2015 as well.\n\nThere was a brief period where I had grass shrimp in this tank as well as limpets, scuds, and ostracods. They thrived there for 4 years.\n\nThe first crawfish, Tree, lived to be almost 7 years old. She was an expert hunter and would catch the mosquito fish whenever she felt I wasn\'t feeding her often enough. The second crawfish, I only had for 3 months due to the fact I went on vacation. Going on vacation that one time was the turning point for this tank.\n\nI left very specific, very easy instructions for my sister to follow after I found out I needed to make an unplanned emergency trip across the country. That trip lasted 2 months. My system I had set up was very stable, very reliable, and time tested. It worked for the first 6 years I had a crawfish, it shouldn\'t be a problem for the second one. \n\nMy 40 year old sister decided to ignore my instructions and the Google calendar events I scheduled and sent to her phone. She dumped half a container of the two types of food in the tank and just left it alone entirely for the 2 months I was gone after that. The instructions I left were on a strict system. All the tank needed was food twice a week, just one pinch of the betta food (for the mosquitofish seeing they\'re top water fish) and 2 sinking pellets for the crawfish. Very simple instructions that did not take anything but maybe 5 minutes twice a week. \n\nAfter she dumped half of each container in the tank, ammonia spiked, the crawfish died, ammonia spiked worse, and that led to an algal bloom. The plants got choked out by the algae and died back aside from the Java moss that was able to survive floating in the shadows.\n\n The tank was in recovery for a while. I seeded the tank a few times with bladder snails, but the mosquito fish kept eating them, which prevented the tank from self-cleaning. I plan on keeping the mosquitofish once I drain this 55 gallon tank and maybe re-adding them after the tank cycles and gets some plant growth back. \n\nIt\'s sad to see that this tank is going to be taken apart after running since 2015. It\'s seen a lot and stayed looking good until the last 2 years. I don\'t want to start over entirely, but I feel it\'ll be for the best. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I plan on shooting for a plain sand bottom maybe adding some gravel in some areas to help the rice paddy herb root more effectively. I have a very large clump of Java moss that has completely filled a 10 gallon bladder snail tank, so it\'ll be a really great way to seed the tank with cleaners and plants. I\'m thinking about making sure to keep the tank sparse for some bottom cleaners like Cory cats or maybe some loaches. I find catfish appealing, so I hope to get some species of catfish. My LFS has red-tail cats that seem enticing, but are expensive. I have yet to fully decide. &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If I find the money for it, I might try and buy some dwarf hairgrass from Amazon, but I\'ll need advice here for it. I need a link to a reliable Amazon brand to do this as I\'ve spent $60 getting rice paddy herb seeds instead of dwarf hairgrass like what was advertised. I don\'t have a bank account, so I can\'t just go to any online shop to purchase legitimate hairgrass. My only choice it to gamble on Amazon with whatever link y\'all provide. &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I\'m open to stock suggestions for both plants and fish. Ideally I\'ll shoot for a species of catfish or anything that would potentially be compatible with shrimp. I would like getting some cherry shrimp and having them run the tank eventually due to prior experience with them. &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nI\'m well aware I could simply remove the mosquitofish and let the tank self clean with bladder snails, but I think starting over entirely will pay off a lot better in the long run. 10 years of this tank running has been a good run, but it\'s time to move the tank to a different location in my room and start fresh. This will undoubtedly begin a new chapter in my experience with the hobby, and I\'m excited for it\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; Marks paragraphs of importance', '_wheels_21', 'Aquariums', 'https://reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/1ogokfl/calling_it_quits_after_10_years/', 651, 112, '2025-10-26 22:12:14', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Get a grip, this company doesn’t care about you or your family anymore than it cares about these hungry people.](https://old.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1oj6pfd/its_already_started/nm0vmmc/)  \n&gt; Walmart doesnt even care about the people that work for them, that\'s actual fact\n&gt;&gt; I have one. I would not be able afford anymore than that. It\'s called being a responsible adult\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Illness, disability, jobs disappearing happen. Develop empathy for other humans.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Empathy is what makes me help those people. Taking things that aren\'t yours ruins that empathy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taking food from a giant corporation because you\'re in poverty and have to eat does not ruin my empathy. I still try to help those people too.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Im talking about the ones who have 3 4 5 6 kids and milk the government for everything.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Snap fraud is 1% and that is the LOWEST percentage for ANY government program there is. Get some empathy for other humans. Ffs.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your distinct lack of understanding of the system and how it works is based in racist and classist stereotypes. The government assistance programs are so frustrating to navigate and actually receive assistance from that \"milking the government for everything\" isn\'t something that happens. Not to mention the minimal payments that actually happen often aren\'t worth the hours on hold to get the help. Even if it DID happen one in a thousand times, that\'s thousands of hungry mouths, a lot of them kids, that are fed by these programs. Again, develop empathy and stop being okay with kids starving.\n\n&gt; Yeah. Im not blaming people for taking food right now.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you should offer to pay for them? Josh Hawley is trying to get a measure passed to fund SNAP during the shutdown and only one Democrat has signed on. Call your senator!!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; SNAP is ALREADY FUNDED. It\'s part of the program! It has an emergency fund and rules in place specifically for this situation and the GOP IS PURPOSELY IGNORING IT.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The vote hasn\'t happened yet so don\'t make lies, the republicans are saying they want to avoid one-off votes. Let\'s see if the bill is even voted on.\n\"Hawley stressed that he would like a vote on the bill, but that it is so far being blocked from reaching the floor. He believed the legislation, which has 10 Republican co-sponsors and one Democratic co-sponsor, would pass if it hit the floor.\" It\'s up to the majority leader allow it to reach the floor.\n\n&gt; Without profit, there can be no store. No one in the store put anyone in the position they are in. No excuse for theft. \n&gt;&gt; So, what should the kids of welfare recipients do in this situation? What should the disabled grandmother on SNAP do? What should all of the walmart employees that receive benefits do? If I had to choose between feeding my children, or stealing from a company that made $15,000,000,000 in PROFIT, I’m choosing the latter.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; If your choice was starve your kids or steal. Then you should give the children up for adoption as you are obviously incapable of taking care of them. May as well do it as the only other option is literally having them taken from you because you did some stupid crap like stealing.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  “Sorry Timmy! Mommy couldn’t afford food this month, hope you enjoy the orphanage!” The question was “What should the kids of welfare recipients do” not what the parents should do. Should the kids just starve because their parents work for Walmart? \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It\'s false equivalence. If the parent can not provide and the child will suffer, then the parent should do the right thing and turn the child over to the state. You also state that children should starve because the parents work at Walmart. My kid isn\'t starving, and I work for Wallyworld. Maybe budget correctly and work hard to provide. Don\'t make excuses why stealing is your only option because you are too lazy to explore whatever options you have.\n\n[“tHeY sHoULd GeT jObs” as if most of the ppl on SNAP are actually working because unless you’re retired, you are required to work so many hours in a week. I know retired ppl living on social security who only get $20 in SNAP because they “make too much” It’s not just some lazy mid, 20s woman of color who popped out six kids who gets free housing and everything else free that’s getting EBT like Fox News told most of you.](https://old.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1oj6pfd/its_already_started/nm15nob/)\n&gt; Yet, so often it actually is just that\n&gt;&gt; No, it isn\'t. Fraud is almost non-existent in the SNAP program.\n\n[Damn, yall crazy and entitled as fuck for blaming starving people.

I get there are people who need food stamps and EBT to get by, but if you are trying to push out a cart fully loaded with ribeyes, crab legs, sodas and other non necessities then you were not using your relief right in the first place. I am not saying just because you have to have assistance that you don\'t deserve a good meal once in a while, but you know damn well a lot of these people abuse it. I bet there are plenty of people that have stuff at home, but it isn\'t what they want to resort to. Edit: I came from a single income, single parent home. We would consistently have struggle meals.

If you are just trying to survive on little money and may or may not have the tools,skills or time to cook cheap meals sometimes those junk foods are the easiest option\n&gt;&gt; True. I can see that. But, learning a few quick cheap meals is healthier and cheaper.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The cheaper meals usually last a day. Daily, you\'re going to be talking a lot of money.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats just incorrect. 1 pound of kidney beans is under five dollars and 32 oz of rice is also under five dollars. With that I could feed my family for several days. Add a bit more for very little extra cost and you could go the whole week. This is also a very healthy meal to eat over several days. People literally just don\'t know how to shop and eat fresh.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Huh?? A big pot of spaghetti can last for a whole week...\n\n&gt; Okay… and? Does that mean they should starve this month?\n&gt;&gt; Supplemental food assistance keyword supplemental.\n\n&gt;&gt; Of course not. I just think they probably have real food at home, or a family/friends house. I am curious to see what gets stolen on my first shift after the 1st.

The government failed these people, we as a society failed them\n&gt;&gt; Starve? They shouldn\'t even be effected by the snap cut off yet. Who is starving. Government has been shutdown for a while maybe less soda pop and steaks and more water and soup. Its almost like you should critically think and prepare for things\n&gt;&gt;&gt; SNAP covers like 2 weeks worth of food, people aren\'t just riding it out for the whole month. Judge not lest ye be judged. EDIT: Y\'all \"Christian\" Bible thumpers don\'t like it when someone quotes the book you never read, huh?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh so they run out with shopping carts full of food monthly than right?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did I say that? Educate yourself on how these programs work before judging people. What you see vs someone\'s actual situation are often completely different.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry I was critically thinking. I am sorry i know its hard for you to come up with thoughts and connect dots. Why do you guys always defend criminals?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you ever stop and think that maybe acting like this is the reason why this country is where it is right now? The people trying to feed their families aren\'t the issue here. You don\'t see a problem with the fact that the government has forced people to do what they have to do to survive?\n\n&gt;&gt; Then they should get a job\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What about people with disabilities? What about the people who are already working a job and just not getting paid enough? Just saying, Walmart workers are the highest recipient of food stamps in the country because of how shit their pay is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While that may be a fact, about Walmart associates getting food stamps a lot. I think that varies by state.

I\'ve been there.\n\n&gt;&gt; Yes it is....\n\n&gt;&gt; Most people can afford groceries, they just need to change their eating and spending habits. You can eat 3 meals a day off less than $6 just eating tv dinners.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But who is going to keep eating that everyday. Most tv dinners aren’t appetizing and not much very unhealthy to consume daily.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not ideal, but neither is going hungry. The point I was making is that there are low-cost ways to get by if you adjust your habits. You can eat three meals a day off TV dinners for less than what you’d make working an hour at minimum wage. Or grab 40 pounds of rice for around $30, or just about 4 and a half hours work being paid minimum wage, and eat for a month. It’s not fancy, but it keeps you fed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV dinners, ramen, pot pies. All pretty cheap. Hell making a pot pie at home is even cheaper if you\'re willing to eat it for a few days.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We\'re not talking about luxury here, we\'re talking about not going hungry.. . Variety isnt always an option\n\n&gt;&gt; Kind of depends on what specifically they are trying to walk out with or if they have exhausted other options prior to stealing. For food I always consider stealing to be the absolute last option \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah but you got rich people stealing because they dont want to spend money on that\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If it’s food, it really doesn’t matter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kind, not sure why I am getting downvoted for it, unless someone is completely out of food and has hit that desperation to steal, there are options outside SNAP, if they aren’t available all bets are going to be off for people.\n\n&gt; You have to remember you’re on Reddit, let these people wallow in despair and keep it moving. Me and my family aren’t doing the best, but I’m not gonna try my hand at wheeling out a car full of oxtails because of it\n&gt;&gt; Yes I know, I was ready for the downvotes.

Those restaurants don\'t get their supplies (food included) for free. How long do you think that\'s actually going to last for the few places that are doing it? Food banks are prepping because they\'re going from dwindling supplies, to hoping for tons of donations, to being quickly dried up because they have millions of dollars less in their budget from their budgets being drastically cut.

(8, 'reddit', '1o4qrm6', 'Who Says You Can\'t Go Home? A Detailed Report On My Week In Lahore, Pakistan', 'tl;dr Lahore is basically safe, cheap, with lots of amazing food and sights, but you need to be careful, especially when flying out of the country. No apologies for what is an extremely long post.\n\n**Images**\n\n1) Badshahi Mosque\n\n2) Delhi Gate\n\n3) Alamgiri Gate\n\n4) Sidewalk outside Bagh-e-Jinnah\n\n5) A truck in the walled city\n\n6) Mangos at Carrefour\n\n7) Corn for sale outside the Delhi gate\n\n8) Lunch at Platter Junction, Emporium Mall  \n\n\n**Background**\n\nI was born in Lahore, Pakistan and spent a significant part of my childhood there. I recently visited Lahore for the first time since I left decades ago with my wife who is not of Pakistani origin.\n\nWe spent five full days in Lahore, with a long day of travel on both ends, including layovers. We applied for free e-visas via the Nadra website ([https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/)) and got them in about 24 hours. I planned this trip once before and applied for an e-visa back then as well. That application included a lot of personal questions like my religion, but the application process has been simplified in the last 1-2 years.\n\nI would strongly recommend bringing a printed copy of the visa grant notice you get from Nadra as I needed this in a surprising number of places beyond immigration when entering Pakistan, including my hotel, currency exchange shop and even checking in for my flight leaving the country. My passport with an entry stamp seemed to be of little interest.\n\n**Things To Know**\n\nSome general points that might help orient your trip:\n\n* Pakistan is not just a developing country, but it’s also, in my opinion, a country in decline. This means that the quality of the people is great but the quality of institutions, systems and infrastructure is not. \n* It’s cheaper to rent a car with a driver than to drive that car yourself. My hotel, one of the nicest in Pakistan, didn’t have an iron in the room but ironed shirts for about $1 US and could dry clean them for about $2-3 US.\n* Pakistan is an isolated country internationally for the size of its population and its diaspora. There are only about 30-40 international flights a day into Lahore, a city of more than 10 million. For a long time, no one wanted to visit and no one wanted to do business here and this is reflected in the quality and availability of products and services.\n* There is a significant security presence around the city, particularly anywhere you would go as a visitor. At one point, I noticed that my hotel as well as the eight buildings to its left, all had at least one armed guard standing outside.\n* You will spend a lot of your time thinking about clean water, clean toilets and how to safely get from one place to the next. You can’t really just walk around, even in the nicest of neighbourhoods, because sidewalks are messy or nonexistent and there are few traffic lights or crosswalks.\n* Protests broke out in Lahore just as we left which closed all schools, the metro and lots of major roads in the western and central parts of the city. If we had been near the old city at the time, it would have been absolute chaos trying to get across town. This is where having an insurance policy, whether it\'s a friend, a relative, a nice hotel or even a hired driver, can really make a difference.\n\n**Arrival**\n\nThe airport terminal was clean but old, including the bathroom before immigration. Clearing immigration took a few minutes and all I needed was my passport and printed visa confirmation. For those who are nervous, they didn\'t check anything else and don’t ask any questions. There are a confusing set of lines here, divided into a few for Pakistani citizens, one for overseas Pakistanis, one for foreigners, one for Chinese passport holders and one or two just for women.\n\nThe wait for bags was probably about five minutes but the crowd around the carousel was huge. All baggage must be x-rayed before leaving. This entire process took about a half hour and we forgot to exchange currency in our rush to get out of the airport. We had arranged a driver from the hotel who was waiting outside the door with my name on a sign. Walking into the waiting area was like a scene from a movie and I wish I had taken a picture of it. There were probably 1,000 people of all ages standing outside.\n\nWe paid PKR 3,500 (about $15 US) for the driver to pick us up and while you could probably make this trip for 500-600 rupees, I think this was money well-spent. Just about every international flight to Lahore arrives between 8 pm and 4 am. I can’t imagine trying to use one of the local rideshare apps for the first time in a crowded place like this airport. I would strongly recommend arranging for your hotel or hostel to pick you up.\n\nJust before we got into the crowd, an armed police officer stopped me and asked to see my wife’s passport. He looked at it and handed it back without a word. It seemed more like it was for her protection than it was out of suspicion, and it happened four more times during our five-day trip. From the conversations I had with police and security guards, who often directly asked me to confirm that my wife wasn’t Chinese, it appears there is a requirement for Chinese citizens to travel around the city with their own security detail. My wife is not Chinese but can pass for Chinese.\n\n**Hotel**\n\nWe stayed at the Nishat Hotel in Gulberg, in the southern part of Lahore, for about $250 US per night. Our primary concern was security, followed by cleanliness. We also considered the Pearl Continental and the Avari, both closer to the city centre, but decided on the Nishat because the rooms looked nicer and the Gulberg area has more in terms of nice restaurants and cafes. After having been there, the Ramada in Gulberg looked nice, with lots of restaurants in close proximity.\n\nThe Nishat was very secure with great staff. We were upgraded to a studio suite and got a fruit basket every day that we enjoyed. The Pakistani cricket team was staying in this hotel at the same time as us. We saw both coaches and players in the lobby, the restaurant and the gym, which incidentally is quite good.\n\n**Getting Around**\n\nLahore doesn’t really have much in the way of public transportation except for buses, including a couple of bus-only roads that appear on Google as a metro, as well as an actual subway line. One downside of staying in Gulberg is that you’ll be far from both the bus metro and the actual metro.\n\nUber and Careem, which often get mentioned in guides or blog posts, are no longer available in Pakistan. There are a few local options like InDrive or Yango. I chose InDrive based on reading people’s opinions on r/Pakistan or r/Lahore. I took 29 rides with InDrive over five days and had only good experiences. The worst thing that happened was that a couple of the drivers had really strong body odour.\n\nInDrive is extremely cheap, about 300-1,000 PKR to go from Gulberg across town to the Lahore Fort depending on what option you choose. We usually chose the most expensive option, a sedan with AC, but there are options for rickshaws, motorcycles and smaller cars as well. Over the last couple of days I used the second-most expensive option as the cars were cleaner. With this option, the cost was 200 rupees within Gulberg and 500 rupees to go to Model Town.\n\nDrivers will regularly want your phone number and call you both when they accept your ride and once they arrive. However, the call quality on the app is horrendous in the best of situations and worse in a crowded place. If you can’t at least text in romanized Urdu (eg “mein gate ke samne hoon”), I’m not quite sure how easy it would be to use this. Drivers were apathetic at worst and super helpful at their best. About 5-6 asked if I wanted to hire them as a driver. One asked me to cancel the ride to help him save about 80 rupees in tax, which tells you a bit about what it’s like to live in Pakistan.\n\nPeople drive both slowly (seldom above 50 km/h) and aggressively and you will come within inches of hitting another vehicle on a regular basis. You will also regularly see carts pulled by horses and donkeys, to the point that it stops being a novelty. I was in two small accidents during my time there, one where our car cut off a motorcycle on our left but a rickshaw tried to squeeze through and hit our car, as well as two motorcycles to the left of the rickshaw. Another time, our driver went the wrong way down a tight alleyway, reversed for about 600 metres and then hit a motorcycle that was clearly visible in the rear camera.\n\n**Day 1**\n\nWe used day 1 as a sort of warmup to get our feet wet. Since we forgot to exchange money at the airport, we exchanged money at the hotel. To their credit, they told us that they charge a 5% fee and gave us detailed directions to the best places for currency exchange. However, taking a car there required cash we didn’t have, so we just exchanged $100 at the hotel. Note that most places will only change $100 US notes, though other currencies might be different. \n\nWe went out for coffee to Brew Bar, where the coffees and almond croissant (1900 rupees) were better than what we got at the hotel breakfast. From there, we went to the Emporium Mall (900 PKR) for sightseeing, shopping and lunch. The mall was quite large and a sign of the growing middle class in Pakistan. I liked seeing people take family pictures or selfies because the mall was a destination for them.\n\nWe had lunch at the Platter Express in the food court, where one of the smaller Pakistani food platters, a small pizza and a large Coke cost about 1,800 rupees. After that we bought a mango from the Carrefour for 300 rupees, which was both delicious and also the only mango we had during our trip as they seemed to disappear from fruit stands and Carrefours afterwards.\n\nWe relaxed at the hotel in the afternoon and went for dinner at the Chinese restaurant in the Avari. The service was great and the food was quite good but expensive. We paid about 7,500 rupees for a soup, chicken wings, Szechuan chicken and fried rice. The hotel itself was almost empty. We were the only people in the restaurant for most of our meal, I saw only a few people in the Pakistani restaurant across the hall, and the lobby was fairly empty as well. The hotel looked old and a bit faded, but I like the service, the atmosphere and the location.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nThis was the best day of our trip. We went to the Lahore Fort in the morning, getting off on Fort Road directly south of Hazuri Bagh (we put Alamgiri Gate into InDrive). There is no signage, but a gate and security guards at Fort Road. Don’t be afraid to ask a security guard if you’re unsure.\n\nThe Alamgiri Gate, which you often see in pictures and images of Lahore, is even more amazing in person with a Pakistani flag on top. If you are facing the gate, the entrance to the Lahore Fort is around the corner on your left. Entrance was 1,000 rupees per person for foreigners and 100 for locals. I thought I could charm my way into paying the 100 rupees, but they charged us both 1,000 each.\n\nWe spent more time here than we anticipated, about two hours. Our favourite part was the Sheesh Mahal, but the picture wall, the elephant steps and sitting under a huge tea for tea near Moti Mosque were also highlights. The fort is sadly not very well-preserved, particularly in the northern and eastern parts near Masti Gate, which is cool in a way because you feel the history more, but also sad to see considering what it was once like. There is also a tremendous amount of graffiti in some older structures near Shah Jahan’s quadrangle.\n\nWhen leaving, we ended up going back out a different way through Greater Iqbal Park to Circular Road. This is one of the busiest, most crowded parts of Lahore and trying to get an InDrive to come to this spot was very hard. Try not to exit this way unless you have a driver waiting for you.\n\nWe actually went back to the hotel for a few hours and came back in the evening because we wanted to see Badshahi Masjid at sunset. This was the highlight of our trip. If you’re taking an InDrive, just put the Alamgiri Gate as your location as the Badshahi Masjid is across from the Lahore Fort. Our driver let us on a side street at the northeast corner of the mosque. Some guy sitting on a chair in a park led us across the back of the mosque and we came in a side entrance near the prayer area.\n\nThe mosque is stunning at dusk for its beauty and its size. It was my favourite place in Lahore as a child and it seemed even more impressive all these years later, compared with both my memories and pictures you see online. People of all types come there to sightsee, hang out, pray or even rest. We arrived at 5 pm and heard the call to prayer and watched the maghrib prayer around 5:50 pm, which was really cool. It was dark just after 6 and most people had left. \n\nWe had dinner nearby at Haveli, which has a rooftop with views of the mosque. This was my favourite meal of our trip. We paid about 6,000 rupees for a handi and kebab platter with naan, drinks and a salad. One nice touch they have is a handwash basin they bring to your table before and after your meal. They also have live music, which you may like or hate depending on your taste.\n\nA traditional qawwali performance was starting on the second floor as we left, but the group they were performing for hadn’t arrived yet, so the singers invited us to sit, which we did for just about two minutes. I had been hoping to see some qawwali, but a personal concert for two, in this location, was more than I could have imagined.\n\nHaveli is on the Fort Road Food Street, which is made for tourists, with lots of great restaurants and cafes. We sat and had tea on the street afterwards at Chai Ishq . I’m not sure if it’s the name of the cafe or just the worker I saw, but they served each cup of tea with a poem, which was cool to see. This was a great opportunity to people watch and while we probably saw 10-15 tourists, most were locals of all types.\n\nWe walked out a few minutes early waiting for our car, probably around 9 pm, and we were soon surrounded by four people asking for money: an old woman selling toys, a child, a trans woman and an old man in religious attire. The security guards helped us a bit in getting the car to our location and giving us space while getting in.\n\n**Day 3**\n\nI went to Data Darbar and the walled city of Lahore by myself in the morning. I didn’t think my wife would enjoy it and I also didn’t think it would be a pleasant experience for her. The walled city is just south of the Lahore Fort and Data Darbar, a Sufi shrine that’s about 1,000 years old, is just west of the walled city.\n\nData Darbar is at probably the dirtiest, most crowded and dodgiest intersection I have seen in Lahore. The shrine is right on the street and I was swarmed by people asking me for donations along with other things I couldn’t quite understand, before going through security. Inside you’ll see people praying, chatting, sleeping and even singing. I stopped to watch one singer for a few minutes and gave him 100 rupees.\n\nData Darbar was meaningful to me because in many ways, it represents the soul of Lahore to me, especially historically. The city and the country might be going in a different direction now, but the culture, the dancing and the music associated with Data Darbar are all things I value.\n\nI then crossed the street twice, since Data Darbar is at sort of a three-way intersection, to get to the walled city. This was not at all easy and I tucked myself in behind others trying to cross the road.\n\nThe southwest corner of the walled city, near Bhatti gate, was an absolute, muddy mess of garbage, smoke from rickshaws, people lying on the ground and animals. In general, the walled city is much more developed in the north and the east, but has less to see in the southwest where I started. I saw shops selling pigeons, people bathing on the street, children leading donkeys carrying cement and people sorting garbage in tiny shops. Lots of kids were playing in the streets, or working, on a Wednesday morning.\n\nAs I walked, I started to see heritage sites such as havelis, plus tiny restaurants, shops and mosques that must have been 200-300 years old. Probably the most interesting spot was an intersection with two restaurants, a fruit stand and a barber who works outdoors next to the fruit stand. I didn’t see a single other tourist in two hours and often felt self-conscious about taking pictures since the streets are so narrow. \n\nI walked all the way across the walled city to the Delhi gate, which is the most touristy part not counting the fort itself. It was very interesting, but also dirty, loud and chaotic. Still, nothing bad happened to me. Only a few people spoke to me, and they all thought I was a local. The Delhi gate is chaotic to put it mildly and you’ll want to have a clear plan for how to get out. The InDrive car I got wanted an extra 500 rupees for coming to this part of town and I gladly paid. Even so, it was hard to find the car, so if you’re not confident in your spoken Urdu or your Lahori street smarts, I would encourage you to get a guide and/or a driver.\n\nWe came back to the Badshahi Masjid again at sunset because I loved it that much. On our way out, the people keeping shoes kept asking for more money, without specifying an amount. We had a snack near the mosque on the food street and on our way out, the security guard at the gate asked me for money (“sir, chai pila dein”). The same child beggar from the previous day tried to open our car door for us in hopes of money.\n\nWe had dinner at Ambarsariya in Gulberg and when we got out, an old man selling shoe inserts approached us for money and laid on a very strong guilt, telling us how he was now dependent on others but wished that it never happened to my parents, that he wished only the best for my parents, that he was sure I was a good son. My heart absolutely broke listening to this, but I was emotionally exhausted after less than 72 hours in the city.\n\nWe stopped at a dessert place (Bundu Khan) 100 metres from our hotel and on the walk back, a woman chased us almost the entire way, asking for money, telling us that her kid had to eat, that the poor also deserved to eat, that I should be more generous since I had so much money.\n\n**Day 4**\n\nOur plans for the last two days was to take it easier after two days in the old city. I ran in the morning at Bagh-e-Jinnah. It’s quite a big space and one full loop of the park is around 2.5 kilometres, with a dedicated jogging path that’s a 1.8-kilometre dirt loop. I ended up holding my phone in my hand, but it was no different than running anywhere else in the world. The park itself is quite nice, with lots of gardens, a library, little food stands and playgrounds. \n\nWe went out for breakfast at Cafe Aylanto, where we had French toast and pancakes (6,000 rupees). This was one of the nicest places, period, I saw in Lahore and we actually ate here four times during our trip. From there we went shopping at Packages Mall and bought quite a few books at the Liberty Books there. We had a small lunch here at the Tawa Chatkhara.\n\nIn the evening, we went for a walk around Bagh-e-Jinnah and decided to walk the 500 metres to dinner at the Pearl Continental hotel. This is probably the longest we walked on the streets here and while this part of Mall Road is pleasant, it turned into a mess because although the intersection east of Bagh-e-Jinnah has a crosswalk, you still have to cross through left-turning cars to get there and you can’t see those cars from the crosswalk. Once we made it across, we ran into a police roadblock that had closed the street in front of the hotel. They were quite rude to me until the senior officer in charge saw my wife, asked for both our passports and let us through when he saw that we were from wealthy countries.\n\nThe Pearl Continental looked about the same as it did when I was a kid. It was under extraordinary security, but was also far, far busier than the Avari, which is just down the street. The lobby had been renovated, however, and there was a huge crowd of international business people chatting under massive chandeliers. Dinner at Marco Polo was forgettable and what looked to be most of the South African cricket team next to us had a similarly difficult time getting someone to take their order.\n\nWe went up to the Rumours sports bar, which is one of a handful of legal bars in Pakistan. Lots of posts online vaguely allude to this as a secret place you have to ask about, but it’s in plain sight as a repurposed guest room with a sign on the door. Simply take the elevator to the second floor, go straight and it’s the first room on your right, number 242. There was a weird dance about supposedly only serving foreigners who are also staying at the hotel and them repeatedly asking for the name of the hotel we were staying. We brought our passports but they just asked for our citizenships and left it there.\n\nOne Murree lager cost 1,600 rupees and it was an okay beer, but I would have preferred to drink it someplace other than that bar given that it was smoky and tense. A number of places in Lahore also legally sell alcohol to foreigners and I would have preferred to do that.\n\n**Day 5**\n\nOn our last day in Lahore, I got up early to run at Model Town Park. I grew up in this area and went to this park often as a kid, but none of it looked familiar all these years later. It was another pretty good place to run, with a dirt 2.2-kilometre loop that is probably close to being a perfect circle. The park has a few small shops, lots of grass, and an entrance lined with palm trees and a huge Pakistani flag. Again, it was we went for breakfast again at the Cafe Aylanto, followed by a trip back to Model Town to see my childhood house which looked basically the same after all these years. From there we went on to Emporium Mall to do a bit of shopping for gifts, followed by samosa chaat for lunch in the food court.\n\nWe did our packing in the afternoon and had dinner nearby our hotel at Mystique. I went to Bundu Khan for one last dessert and the badam halwa was so good that I stopped eating because I didn’t think anything else I ate could top it. \n\n**Departure**\n\nEverything about leaving this country was an absolute nightmare. We got to the airport a little over three hours before our flight. When we finally got through the narrow entrance that was lined with hundreds of people, the guard wouldn’t let us into the terminal, simply saying that checkin for our flight was not open but refused to say when checkin might open. Honestly, it  felt like he wanted a bribe. We tried an adjacent entrance where the guard let us in without a hassle, but this still gives me nightmares.  \nWe passed through a security check to get into the terminal, but the female guards who frisked my wife decided there was something suspicious about her suitcase. They opened it and went through its contents in their entirety, asking lots of questions that seemed motivated mostly by personal curiosity, before giving up after about 5-7 minutes. They couldn’t explain in English or in Urdu what they were looking for.\n\nOur airline’s checkin counter was open and there was no line. The agent asked us both for our visas. From there, it was off to the passport control, which had long, slow-moving lines for Chinese passport holders, foreigners and Pakistani passport holders. Someone offered to get us through the line quickly in exchange for money but wouldn’t say how much. I offered the 1,000 rupees left in my wallet and he laughed, but suggested the line for Chinese passport holders was faster. We stood in that line, where probably 90% of the people weren’t Chinese, and got through after a half hour minutes.\n\nThe security check was pretty quick if chaotic and halfhearted. The agents flagged the man in front of me for having medication, and he explained that it was thyroid medication for which he had a prescription as well as a doctor’s note. He was still there after I had gotten my stuff back together and walked away. It took us about 90 minutes to from start to finish to get through security, with two overt and one subtle requests for bribes in that time.\n\nThe shops after security are pretty basic, but there’s actually a pretty good food court if you turn left and go up the escalators after passing security. The boarding procedure was decent, although no one checked my wife’s passport before boarding. I enjoyed my trip immensely, but I was very, very relieved to get on the plane.\n\nAs a final insult, when I got home, I saw that my suitcase had been opened, the compartments unzipped and someone had gone through the contents in their entirety.. Nothing was stolen and I was glad that they touched the sweaty running clothes I left on top.\n\n**Dressing As A Foreigner And A Woman**\n\nLots of people are curious about this, especially for women. My wife noticed the intense staring from the gate where we boarded our flight to Lahore. It continued, in nice places and not-so-nice places. Another thing she noticed was how few women there were in public places and how many men there were in shops, hotels or tourist attractions, often just hanging out with nothing to do but stare at her. No one spoke to her, even when they needed to, instead speaking to her through me. No one asked any questions or said anything in appropriate. A couple of women asked to take selfies with her, which she said yes to.\n\nIn terms of dressing, I suggested that she cover up in the older part of town near the Lahore Fort but not in Gulberg near our hotel or in any mosques. We saw plenty of Pakistani women without their heads covered, even at Badshahi Masjid, but she said in general covering her head made her stand out less than she would otherwise. \n\nWe both tried to dress down and wore long pants with button down shirts, but even if people couldn’t necessarily tell that I was from overseas, they could definitely tell that I had money. I don’t think there’s anything I could’ve done about that.\n\n**Money**\n\nWe went to very nice places to eat and took the most expensive option on InDrive, which takes either cash or domestic payment options we couldn’t use. All in all, we exchanged $200 US for about 57,000 rupees and had about 5,000 left at the end of our trip. We spent around 80,000 rupees in five days on credit cards for meals and shopping. I recognize that this is probably at the upper limit of what most people would spend. \n\nWe kept our money and phones in small crossbody bags. I only felt unsafe in some areas around Data Darbar and some parts of the walled city. Otherwise, it was basically business as usual. I used a travel wallet where I kept only notes of 100 rupees and smaller, with larger notes of 500 or 1,000 in a separate place.\n\nI noticed most places in Emporium at least had very consistent exchange rates that were almost identical to what you\'d see on Google.\n\n**People**\n\nI loved the people. So many people went out of their way to help me in different ways when they didn’t have to, in big ways and small. I thought people were friendly, warm if a bit excessively deferential in service settings. But I thought so many people I met would have done anything for us, which was really touching throughout the trip.\n\nIf there is a negative, I often saw that people wouldn\'t make suggestions or decisions for themselves, just throwing it back to me. For example, if I asked a driver to take me to the closest gate of a park with multiple entrances, they would just repeat that they would take me anywhere I wanted. Or, if a dish was late to the point of being forgotten, as it happened just about every time we ate out, and I asked if it could be canceled, they would say that it was almost ready but that it could be canceled, because they would do whatever I wanted. Even people trying to hustle me into paying them to be a tour guide, pay extra for storing my shoes or bribing my way through a security line wouldn\'t name a price, but say I could pay whatever I wanted.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThis was home for me. It felt surreal to come back and realize that I was born there, and grew up there. I have lived and traveled around the world, constantly explaining my background to people. It was amazing to go to a place where I didn’t have to explain anything but I could just be. I loved speaking Urdu, I loved people assuming I was from there and I loved learning about my heritage. \n\nThere were so many things I hated. I hated the traffic, the air quality (the AQI was around 150-250 in early October), the poverty, the lack of security and the way people often tried to squeeze a few dollars out of me in alternatively vague or aggressive ways. But this was home, and I loved it.', 'Necessary_Low_6669', 'travel', 'https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1o4qrm6/who_says_you_cant_go_home_a_detailed_report_on_my/', 629, 39, '2025-10-12 20:39:42', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Rabid dog?**\n\nHey guys, I\'m kinda freaked out and need some advice. My wife and I just moved to the outskirts of Phitsanulok a few weeks ago. We\'re surrounded by cassava, corn, and rice fields. It\'s pretty quiet out here, which is nice, but lately I\'ve been hearing some weird shit at night.\n\nFor the past few nights, around 2 or 3 AM, I\'ve been woken up by these super weird noises coming from the fields.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just some dogs fighting or something, but it doesn\'t sound quite right.\n\nIt\'s like this low, guttural growling mixed with what sounds like... I don\'t know, wet shuffling? It\'s hard to describe, but it\'s creeping me out. It sounds like squelching if that makes sense -- like wet.\n\nWe have large sliding window doors from our bedroom that basically just step out into the yard and my bed is right next to them.\n\nWe close the curtains at night (even though there\'s really nothing around).\n\nBut it\'s easy for me to peel back the curtain and look outside.\n\nWe don\'t have any street lamps out here or anything so it\'s basically pitch black, but I can see something moving around in the field across the street (which is now just dirt because they harvested the large cassava plants that were there).\n\nI mean it LOOKS like a big dog, but the way it moves is just off. Like jerky and unnatural.\n\nIts eyes caught some light and reflected and they were really bright and it scared the crap out of me. The eye shine that animals have if you know what I\'m talking about, but this was dimmer like it was coming from inside the things head (like if you were to cover a flashlight with a blanket).\n\nI opened the sliding door to see if I could hear anything and it smelled like a kind of rotting meat smell outside and I heard almost like a wet sliding sound and grunting.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that there is like kind of dog with rabis out here and that is scaring me because I have a 10 month old.\n\nIs rabis common out in the countryside areas? I know there are a lot of dogs out here and people kind of just let them run around I\'m worried if there is a rabid dog it could spread.\n\nAnyone else in Phitsanulok experienced anything like this? Or am I just being paranoid?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n**Comments:**\n\n**Comment1**: I’m also team wild boar. I’m from north germany and we have them a lot in the woods. They are smelly and loud as hell. You can hear them from &gt;100m clearly.  \nEdit: got curious and read about Phitsanulok NP and to my surprise you also have moon bears, tigers and leopards there. Good luck with a peaceful sleep!\n\n**Comment2:** There are vultures in Thailand, believe it or not, especially around the national parks. Perhaps that’s what you’re seeing and hearing, and it would explain the rotting meat smell. The only other thing I can think of is a wild boar. I would look for tracks in the morning and see what you see.\n\n**Comment3**: Nah bruh this is terrifying id be out of there the next morning. From what I know a rabid dog should not have any smell at all. And everything else sounds equally terrifying. For your sake I hope this is just some good storytelling…\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I thought maybe it could just be dirty or injured or have mange or something? The smell is pretty strong though. I can only really explain it as rotting meat. I\'m not much of storyteller hah hah just explaining what\'s going on.  \nHoping somebody might have some insight. We can\'t really leave since we essentially built a house here and have literally just moved in.\n\n**Comment4:** Your in Thailand man, the past still lives there, like black magic, ghosts, demons, spirits good and bad. I would say it\'s one of those. Thailand is a place of seers and prophets.\n\n&gt;**Comment5**: 100% although this stuff exists everywhere.  \nIMO in Thailand they have more power because of collected belief in spirits. Blame everyone for giving spirits Fanta as a substitute for blood lol  \nI don\'t see it being a boar, it should be obvious with the tracks.\n\n**Comment6:** How close were you to it? I just couldn’t ever imagine a smell that bad unless it was actually a dead animal. That in combo with the noises and it being at the same time is genuinely nightmare fuel. No actual insight but I hope you figure it out. Keep us posted\n\n&gt;**OOP:** So we have a small lot of land with about 20 meters between my bedroom window (which steps out into the yard) and the road. The road is very small. You can barely fit two cars next to each other on it. And basically across the road is just fields as far as you can see (right now flat and dirt, but before it was really tall cassava plants when we first got here).  \nBut it was strong enough for me to be able to smell it.\n\n**Comment7**: It\'s probably just dogs. I am in Phetchabun and all the weird noises I hear turn out to be dogs.. they get up to some annoying shit in the middle of the night.  \nEdit: I\'d recommend getting a motion camera\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Update (4 days later) -- The noises are still going on at 3AM every morning, I bought a bunch of CCTV cameras**\n\nFigured I\'d do a quick update to this original post:\n\nI\'m really freaking out now. My wife is terrified as well. That weird \"creature\" keeps coming around at 3AM or so and stalking the area around the house -- always just out of view in the fields.\n\nHere is a picture of the area the next morning. I don\'t see any dirt disturbed so I don\'t see how it\'s a wild boar.\n\n*\\[\\* OOP includes picture of field in daytime --* [*photo#1*](https://preview.redd.it/update-the-noises-are-still-going-on-at-3am-every-morning-i-v0-zap6bj3igbhe1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3cf41421f3771503781c983bd200c19171e55b4) *-- with this description, \"The area across the street where I hear the noises / see the movement\"\\]*\n\nI just bought a BUNCH of CCTV cameras that can see at night I\'m getting them set up around the property now because we are really scared.\n\nHere\'s the kind I got.

I woke up a few times in the middle of the night, I heard movement outside the kitchen. I was convinced it was people, like buffalo are all in the stable at that time.

(10, 'reddit', '1o0ke6c', 'Kyushu travel guide – off the beaten path on Japan\'s 3rd biggest island', 'Maybe you’re like me, and after your first visit to Japan, you’re looking to go again, but to a different area. And perhaps a bit off the beaten path this time. Kyushu definitely fits the description. The problem is there’s less information on it since not so many people visit. I’ve spent a lot of time putting my trip together, and with this post I would like to cover everything you need to know about going to Kyushu.  \n*This is a repost of my post from last week which was removed due to breaking the rules. I edited the content to comply and also used your feedback in the comments to further improve my post.*\n\nI will cover why you should visit, when, how to get around Kyushu, how many days you need and what are the main places you should consider for your trip. This will also include some places I haven’t been to, but which might be interesting for you.\n\n**Why visit Kyushu**\n\nThere are many reasons, and while some may depend on your personal preferences, I can confidently say that it’s got everything – amazing nature, great food, interesting cities, history, temples, and much less international tourists than in the more famous places like Kyoto and Tokyo. Going to Kyushu gives you a chance to experience a slightly different Japan, especially when you go to the countryside.\n\n**How many days do you need and where to go in Kyushu**\n\nIn my opinion, you need at least a week, ideally two. If you, for example, will just go for a day or two in Fukuoka and then continue to Hiroshima, it’s better to just skip Kyushu altogether. The exception to this is Yakushima, which is so unique that it’s worth it even when you just fly from Osaka and back, spending 2-3 days here.\n\nThis island is very big and it’s hard picking just few main places, but I will do my best covering them from North to South. Keep in mind these are just the base points with many interesting places between them, which I will cover later. I marked some as skippable – that doesn’t mean they’re bad, but if your time is limited, in my opinion you can skip these without too many regrets.\n\n* **Fukuoka** – the main city here and easiest to get to, so many Kyushu trips will start here. Fukuoka is a big city that feels like a smaller version of Osaka, calmer and with much less tourists. Not many interesting sites to see here, but a pleasant place to spend 1 or 2 days and do a few side trips. Skippable.\n* **Nagasaki** – a nice city surrounded by hills with interesting cuisine, history, and beautiful views. Definitely worth spending at least 2 days here plus many side trip options.\n* **Beppu** – famous for its hot springs, not only for bathing but also sightseeing as they have various colors and styles. It’s a bit run-down resort town, but still worth it for a day. Yufuin, a cute village nearby, is also nice. Skippable.\n* **Kurokawa Onsen** – one of the top onsen destinations in Japan. This is where you go to a ryokan, relax, take a bath, have an amazing meal for dinner and then repeat in the morning. Destination for staying overnight.\n* **Mount Aso** – finally we’re going into the nature. This is a massive volcano where you get to see not only amazing views, but also experience the power which hides in the earth. Many waterfalls and hiking places are in the area. One day is enough but you can spend more in the larger area.\n* **Takachiho** – one of the more touristy places in Kyushu, famous for a small but beautiful gorge. Half a day is enough. Skippable.\n* **Kumamoto** \\- a big city with a significant but damaged castle, nice garden and one piece statues. Skippable unless it\'s Sakura season, then you must go.\n* **Kirishima Kinkowan National Park** – similar to Mount Aso, there are few volcanoes here and even more hiking options. But more importantly, they’ve got a life size *Totoro* statue! Many onsens are available too. Consider spending a day here.\n* **Kagoshima** – a relaxed seaside city right next to an amazing volcano. Good for 1 or 2 days with further side trip options.\n* **Yakushima** – this is the true gem of Kyushu in my opinion. Beautiful forest with mountains covered by rainforests that inspired *Princess Mononoke*. If you\'re from the US, imagine you\'re on Hawai but the island has also got the Pacific north-west forests combined with the Sequoia National Park. Also, there are wild monkeys! You can do lots of hiking here and enjoy some breathtaking views. You really need at least 2 days here, 3 is ideal.\n\n**Getting around Kyushu**  \nNow that we know where to go, the question is how to connect the dots on the map (sample map from my 12 day trip [here](https://imgur.com/a/opDmD48))\n\nFukuoka – Nagasaki – Beppu - Kumamoto: these cities are well connected by train. Conveniently, there is the Nothern Kyushu JR pass which covers all four. Kagoshima is approachable too, but then you would need the *All Kyushu* pass.\n\nThe rest is best visited by car in my opinion (public transport also works but will take much more time and effort). You can go on an awesome road trip from Beppu all the way to Kagoshima, having total freedom to go wherever you feel like, enjoying great views, nature, hiking, the seaside and much more. Driving in Japan can sound intriguing, but it’s really safe. Even if you never tried driving on the left side of the road, you quickly get used to it. Some basic info is on Japan guide. Also consider returning your car at a different location if that suits your trip. You pay a bit more but it’s not so bad if you consider how much time and money would returning to the same location take. For example, for me it cost 32000 ¥ for 4 days rental plus 26000 ¥ fee for getting the car in Beppu and returning it in Kagoshima with *Toyota Rent a Car.* Tolls cost around 2000 ¥ and fuel 5000 ¥.\n\nYakushima is a small island separated from the rest, so getting here is trickier. Ideally you take the ferry from Kagoshima or fly from the airport nearby. There are also direct flights from Osaka and Fukuoka. Once you arrive, I again recommend renting a car (16000 ¥ with *Times Car rental* for 2 days plus 2000 ¥ fuel). But using buses is possible too.\n\n**When to go to Kyushu**  \nAnytime is good, but as this is the southern part of Japan, it’s a bit warmer – therefore avoid summer if you can. Also consider it’s a big temperature difference within Kyushu, e.g. between Fukuoka and Kagoshima since the latter is much more south. The mountains will be colder too. Yakushima has a rainy season from June to mid-July, and then it continues into typhoon season until end of August, so try to avoid the summer for this small island too.\n\nFor example, we went in late November and in Fukuoka it was pretty warm, with most trees still green and we wore light jackets during the day. In the mountains it was much colder, many trees were colorful or already without leaves. A winter jacket was needed. It was even snowing near Kurokawa Onsen. Mount Aso was covered in ice, so they closed access to the crater. We continued south, and suddenly in Kagoshima by the seaside it almost felt like summer with us wearing just sweaters.\n\n**Places to see**  \nBelow I list places to see at every major location, and also places you can visit when you’re moving between them. It’s not exhaustive by any means, but this list is already very long as it is and I tried to cover the more interesting ones. The list is definitely biased in my interests – I prefer natural spots, lowkey restaurants, the seaside, hiking, temples and shrine. I am not so big on shopping and museums.\n\n**Fukuoka in detail**\n\nFukuoka is a pleasant seaside town and feels to me like a smaller version of Osaka. Stay on the lookout for events happening here during your visit to Kyushu, like the Sumo tournament in November or festivals such as Gion Yamakasa.\n\n* Atago Shrine - the view from there over Fukuoka is apparently quite nice. Haven’t been.\n* Momiji Hachimangu - the shrine isn\'t anything special, but we came here for the beautiful goshuincho with autumn leaves, and also the goshuin itself which shows AR characters from Japanese mythology when you scan it with an app. So cool!\n* Momochihama Beach - very nice sandy beach, worth visiting if you enjoy the seaside. I recommend renting a bike (e.g via the Luup app) and ride around.\n* Nokonoshima Island - small island accessible by a short ferry, full of flowers - some were blossoming even in late November. I’d recommend checking recent reviews on google maps to see whether it’s currently worth it going there. Haven’t been.\n* Uminonakamichi Seaside Park – similar to the above island, this is a nice area when the flowers are blooming. You can rent a bike to get around. Haven’t been.\n* Ohori Park - nice park with a big lake in the middle of it, definitely nicer to visit when flowers are blooming. If you’re there, also check out the Ohori Park Japanese Garden\n* Tenjin - main shopping district in Fukuoka, huge options for food as well.\n* Sumiyoshi Jinja - pleasant shrine where you feel in the nature despite being in the middle of the city. \n* Kushida Shrine – beautiful shrine with a huge Yamakasa float on display. Seeing these going through the city during the festival must be amazing. The goshuin here is also nice.\n* Tochoji Temple - has a nice looking pagoda, but the true reason to come is to see the huge Buddha statue (entrance is a bit hidden, you need to walk upstairs). It\'s really impressive and you can even walk through a tunnel inside of it, which is interesting.\n* Hakata station - this building combines so many stores and restaurants, you could spend hours here. Coin lockers on the upper floors tend to be emptier if you need to store luggage. I definitely recommend checking the rooftop platform, the view over Fukuoka is nice and for free.\n* Dazaifu Tenmangu - classic temple with a big shopping street leading to it. The temple is beautiful, and I recommend walking a bit up through the Tori gates to the Tenkai Inari Shrine. This walk can be extended to the Kamado Shrine or even turned into a half day hike to Mount Hōman which is 829m tall.  There is also an apparently very nice Kyushu National Museum. Haven’t been to it. \n* teamLab Forest Fukuoka – doesn’t seem to offer anything special if you’ve been to the installations in Tokyo. You can hunt projected animals using an app on your phone. Haven’t been.\n* Sakurai Futamigaura\'s Couple Stones – if you want to see a tori gate in the sea, this is your chance. However, by public transport it will take a while. Haven’t been.\n* Shiraito Waterfall – nice waterfall and nearby there is a great café in the forest. Getting there will take a while by public transport. Haven’t been.\n* Stayed at AO太宰府 – it was cheaper then staying in Fukuoka itself, simple but nice accommodation\n* **Food**:\n* Nakasu Yatai Yokocho (Food Stalls Street) – Fukuoka is famous for these Yatai food stalls, which seems to impact the price and quality of the food here. I didn’t try anything as the reviews speak for itself. Passing through the area, it didn’t look that interesting.\n* Kokinchan – Yatai in the Tenjin area seemed more authentic, and we enjoyed it a lot. Locals here were very nice and we had an enjoyable chat with them.\n* Ichiran Souhonten - Main Restaurant &amp; Office - this is the flagship store of Ichiran, it looks nice but isn\'t anything special. Since it\'s a big one the queue moves rather quickly. Fukuoka is the birthplace of Hakata ramen (like Ichiran), but there are a ton of other fantastic ramen restaurants in the area that serve some of the best pork-based broth ramen in Japan.\n* うどん 吉（きち） - we randomly visited this udon restaurant and really enjoyed the food as well as the lowkey atmosphere.\n* Koroshi Curry – this one is closer to the Dazaifu area. It’s a very atmospheric curry restaurant with a retro feel. First you order by filling out the paper form and then you can admire the indigenous decoration. Definitely an experience, and the food is good as well.\n\n**Between Fukuoka and Nagasaki in detail**\n\n* Takeo-Onsen - you will most likely change trains here if you travel between Fukuoka and Nagasaki. The Takeo city Library seems beautiful, but I didn’t have enough time unfortunately. I just did a quick walk to the top of the hill at Maruyama Park from which I had a lovely view. There is also a big garden Mifuneyama Rakuen which is famous for Azaela blossom in spring and colorful leaves in Autumn. There’s a Teamlabs here too.\n* Yūtoku Inari Shrine - Massive shrine which looks amazing, but you will spend quite some time getting to it with public transport. Unfortunately, I couldn\'t fit it in the itinerary.\n* Arita – if you are a fan of pottery, you may want to visit this town. There are many shops and also The Kyushu Ceramic Museum. The Sueyama Shinto Shrine is interesting for its porcelain Tori gate. Nearby, there is a cute Okawachiyama Village specialized in ceramics. Haven’t been.\n* Huis Ten Bosch – I can’t imagine anyone from abroad and especially from Europe would want to see Japans’ version of a Dutch town as a theme park. But maybe it is your cup of vla?\n\n**Nagasaki in detail**\n\nOne of my favorite cities in Kyushu, it feels so different from the rest. While it’s by the sea, there are tall hills everywhere around it, from which you can get great views of the whole bay. The history of this city is most known for the atomic bomb disaster, but it also went through an interesting period of Portuguese and Dutch trade during the 16th through 19th centuries which influenced the local cuisine as well as architecture.\n\n* Mt. Inasayama Overlook – top attraction of Nagasaki in my opinion. The view from here after dark is great. I’ve seen a lot of amazing views in Japan, but this one was the best, comparable only with the view from Mount Maya. You can get here easily with the ropeway.\n* Peace park – there are three locations here. The Peace park itself has many statues and a lot of school trips around, but I have to admit the most interesting thing to me were the long escalators leading to it :) . The Hypocenter park is where the severity of what happened hits you. Here is the center of the explosion, and if you walk downstairs to the river, you see the layer of ground hit by the bomb, along with the picture of the devastation. And finally, the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum – for a symbolic price you experience a museum many people claim is better than the one in Hiroshima.\n* Sanno Shrine was completely destroyed by the atomic bomb except for half of a tori gate which you can still see today. There are also two huge camphor trees that survived the blast and now symbolize the coming back to life of the whole city.\n* Fukusaiji – really wanted to see this temple shaped like a turtle, but didn’t have time\n* Sofuku-ji and Kofukuji are temples interesting for their unique look, resembling Chinese style. What is truly impressive though is the huge graveyard on the slope above them. I recommend walking through it (warning, it\'s around 120m elevation), getting through the mystical forest in the upper half and finally reaching the Kazagashira Park. Here you will get an amazing view over the whole city.\n* Megane Bridge - nearby the above mentioned temples, it\'s nothing special but the riverside is nice\n* Dejima – Dutch trading quarter known for its miniature model and thorough museum, didn’t seem too impressive based on what I have seen from the outside but many history fans loved it.\n* Glover Garden - if you\'re a fan of European architecture, you will like this outdoor museum with nice views. Haven\'t been.\n* Nagasaki Shinchi Chinatown - cute but very tiny district, it\'s basically two short streets with Chinese restaurants and few shops. You don\'t go here for sightseeing, but for the food - many dishes from Chinese-Japanese fusion cuisines originate from here such as Champon or pork belly buns. For tourism there are much better Chinatowns like the one in Kobe. Maybe it’s different during the lantern festival.  \n* Gunkanjima Digital Museum – I normally don’t like museums, but this one is amazing. A lot of interactive exhibits, the AR experience was super cool. You learn a lot about how life was on the island, and how crazy big were the mines under it.  *Part of the museum celebrates inclusion of Gunkajima to UNESCO. South Korea was initially against it, but Japan promised it will publicly display how Korean prisoners were forced to work in the mine. Well, after Gunkajima made it to UNESCO, Japan broke its promise which really sucks. You won’t see any mention of Korean prisoners in this museum either. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows in Japan, this country has its problems too.*\n* Gunkanjima (Hashima Island) – if the weather is okay, you can also go to the island itself, with a tour. The areas you can walk at are very limited though, so I opted not to go.\n* Ikeshima Coal Mine – you can explore much more freely on this island, but it’s quite far from Nagasaki. Haven’t been.\n* Mount Unzen and specifically the Unzen Nita Pass have many great hiking options, particularly beautiful in spring when the flowers bloom, or autumn with the colorful leaves. Unzen Jigoku is right below with hot springs to see or eggs to steam and eat. This is far from Nagasaki and maybe makes sense to visit if you then continue on the ferry to Kumamoto. Haven’t been.\n* Stayed at Hotel Belleview Nagasaki Dejima - nice hotel close to everything, and you don\'t hear too much noise from the outside\n* **Food**:\n* Bunjiro Asahimachi – the Tonkatsu here was amazing. Huge portions, make sure you come here hungry.\n* And Barissier - cute hidden coffee upstairs with amazing matcha tiramisu\n* 海鮮·居酒屋 たぬきの里 – super good set meals, especially the miso soup is tasty\n* 濃厚豚骨 かどや - delicious ramen and champon\n* Castella cakes - local sweet from the 16th century. For me they are too sweet but you should try them and maybe take some as souvenir too.\n\n**Beppu in detail**\n\nI’ve seen pictures of Beppu with steam coming out everywhere – seemed overexaggerated. But it is very real, seeing so many pipes and steam was cool. After Fukuoka and Nagasaki which were pretty chill, there was much more tourists here, especially Chinese and Korean. The local businesses around Beppu Hells seemed to cater a lot to that which gives it kind of a tacky vibe. For that reason, I spent less time on research. If you want to, you can definitely find more stuff to do here. Seems like staying at a ryokan or at least bathing in some onsens might be nice (there are not only regular ones but also sand baths, steam baths or mud baths)\n\n* Beppu hells – These aren’t hot springs for bathing, but rather for viewing – each has different colors making some quite photogenic. Many hells have footbaths which are nice for sitting down and relaxing your feet in hot water. Whether you should visit all hells is up to you. Personally, I think you should be picky and go only to those that sound interesting to you. Some seemed very kitsch (like Oniyama Jigoku with the crocodiles) but I really liked Umi Jigoku.\n* Beppu Park – very nice park including a bamboo grove\n* Global Tower – cool looking tower offering nice views over the city\n* Beppu Ropeway - very nice view from top, haven\'t been.\n* Beppu HITPARADE CLUB - all you can eat and drink dinner show featuring Elvis-style performances with lots of local dressed up in 50s-60s costumes and dancing to the music. I don\'t think reservation is required though. I went there as a walk-in customer. Usually they have 5 shows a night with breaks in between, starts from 7pm I believe. Haven\'t been, thanks to commenters for the tip.\n* **Food**:\n* Jigokumushikobo Kannawa  - this seemed like the culmination of Beppu’s touristy vibe. You wait in a long queue to cook food in steam, only to end up eating a mediocre dish. I didn’t try it myself, but seeing the saddened looks of tourists eating tasteless food were enough to make a judgement. What is worthy of your attention though is the free foot bath - both water and steam nearby.\n* Shin Hakata  - great sushi as well as dangojiru (which is basically a miso soup with dumpling noodles and vegetables), I’m so glad I ate here and not at the steamed food place.\n* Robata Jin – didn’t have time to go to this one but leaving it here as it was recommended by a local. This izakaya has delicious seafood and ideally you should book ahead of time.\n\n**Yufuin in detail**\n\nThis cute village is great for staying overnight at a ryokan. During the day, people basically walk through the shopping street from the train station to the Kinrin Lake and that’s about it. Below are some interesting places around, but not are a must – this village can be definitely skipped.\n\n* Yufuin Floral Village is a popular destination here, and while I must admit their small Ghibli shops are cute, the animals seem to live in pretty bad conditions (which is often a problem in Japan). Also, it’s very crowded. Wouldn’t recommend this one.\n* 蜂の巣ログハウジング（株) - nice but expensive woodcraft shop\n* 由布院いちご園 YUFUIN strawberry farm – thanks to hot spring water, they have strawberries here in many varieties which you can pick and eat yourself. Need to reserve in advance. Haven’t been\n* Mount Yufu -  if you’re into hiking, check it out, views from the top are amazing.\n* Stayed at Yufuin Country Road Youth Hostel – for the price (separate room for two), it was amazing! Great view in the morning and a very nice onsen bath. Also, when you leave, the owners sing Country road on guitar for you. Perfect.\n* **Food**\n* Had breakfast at 風の丘 カフェ, which is run by a nice couple who really love everything British. While it wasn’t bad by any means I’d probably go to Ordinary Day Coffee next time.\n* 湯布珈琲 – great matcha latte with dango\n* Milch – tasty mini cheesecakes\n\n**Between Yufuin and Kurokawa Onsen in detail**\n\n* Kokonoe Yume Otsuribashi – very high suspension bridge from which you get great views of two waterfalls\n* Kuju Mountains - You can do some nice hiking here and chill at an onsen afterwards. Or just stretch your legs on the boardwalk across the Tadewara Wetlands and enjoy the scenery. I haven’t been due to heavy snowing but got an amazing view from the road here.\n* Shimonjō Giant Ginkgo Tree – haven’t been but when the leaves turn yellow in early November it has to be stunning\n* Nabegataki Falls – waterfalls interesting for the fact you can also walk behind them and see the sky through falling water. Advance reservation is recommended. Haven’t been\n* Food: Yusuichaya – this was the best tofu I ever had! With the spring water set meal, you get to try so many types of tofu. Their udon is super delicious too. There is a spring water source right next to it where you can see people loading up huge containers of water\n\n**Kurokawa Onsen in detail**\n\nSuper small town in the mountains, the point of visiting is staying overnight at a Ryokan – and there is a lot of them. We stayed at Yamamizuki and it was amazing. In Yamamizuki you can go anytime to the stunning riverside onsen, and the kaiseki dinner was simply amazing. Also, you have free access to two other onsens including an interesting cave one.\n\nAs for the village itself, while it’s pretty there’s not much to see really, it’s just a nice stroll on the streets for half an hour. If you are a big fan of onsens, you can buy a pass to visit 3 of your choice (out of more than 20) at the info center. Worth highlighting are Pâtisserie Roku with tasty creampuffs and Raifu Gift and Curio Shop with very nice woodcraft and tea cups.\n\nIf you have more time here, consider doing a small hike to the observation deck – haven’t been.\n\n**Between Kurokawa Onsen and Takachiho in detail**\n\nMount Aso (parking is elsewhere) - Big volcano caldera with few hiking options, like the 90 min hike to the Nakadake summit. This volcano is very moody – not only the weather can be bad (cloudy, rainy, icy…) but the volcanic activity might increase along with gas level. When that happens, and it does quite often, then the area is closed off. The status is regularly updated online. May the weather and volcano gods bless you during your visit – they didn’t do it for me unfortunately\n\n* Daikanbo Lookout – amazing viewing point, you can see mount Aso and the huge crater around it\n* Kikuchi Gorge – small forested river valley with few walking options. Haven’t been.\n* Koga Falls – probably most interesting after it rained a lot or when it ices over winter. It’s a steep hike from the parking. Haven’t been.\n* Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine – while the shrine looks beautiful in pictures, what they don’t show you are the crowds of people walking up the stairs. I would enjoy the mystical atmosphere of this place if I arrived early morning and didn’t have to listen to heavy breathing of unfit tourists or a child having a tantrum. When you reach the shrine, you can continue up to reach a natural arch which is nice but again nothing special.\n* Oshitoishi Hill – are you into magnetic rocks with a view? Lucky you. Haven’t been.\n* Shirakawa Spring   - if you’re passing by you can try the famous spring water here and enjoy the surroundings. Haven’t been.\n* 高森ツリーハウス – kind of a wooden treehouse which is sadly abandoned, and you can only admire it from the outside. Haven’t been\n* Mount Sobo – if hiking on Mount Aso doesn’t work out due to weather or volcanic activity, you can go hike on this one. Most people start from here. Haven’t been.\n* Food: 山賊旅路 - nice local Japanese restaurant with a lot of interesting decor on the ceiling\n\n**Takachiho in detail**\n\nPeople come her because of the Takachiho Gorge, which is a beautiful gorge where you can go for a short walk and even rent a boat to row under the rocks (reserve in advance). There are some problems though – the gorge is very small (don’t expect a nice hike here), the area where you can row your boat is even smaller, and there’s lots of tourists here. So, it’s questionable whether it’s worth going here just for the gorge.\n\nWhat we did was arrive in the evening and see the shortened Takachiho Kagura play (reservation recommended). Afterwards we checked the gorge, which was completely empty and nicely illuminated. Then we stayed at B&amp;B Ukigumo and returned to the gorge in early morning (8am) before the crowds arrived. Afterwards, we continued by car to the Kunimigaoka Viewing Platform which has amazing views. Doing all this, going to Takachiho felt totally worth it.\n\nI skipped it, but you can also check out the Amanoiwato Shrine where the goddess Amaterasu hid in a cave. The surrounding nature is nice.\n\nFood: Everything in Takachiho seemed reserved (even a ramen place sent us away), it was pretty desperate. Eiraku, a lowkey yakiniku place, saved us. The food was good and cheap.\n\n**Between Takachiho and Kagoshima in detail**\n\n**Miyazaki - east coast**\n\n* Hyuga is a nice seaside town that happens to be on the way to Kagoshima. We had amazing seafood at Seaside Station Hososhima. And from there it’s very close to the Skeluccha Viewing deck – it’s a nice walk and you can see interesting rock shaped into pillars. There is also Ōmi Shrine nearby, with Uto Shrine, a small shrine in a seaside cave right next to it.\n* You can spend much more time on the east coast around Miyazaki. We haven’t been due to limited time, but it may be interesting for you. Below are some suggestions:\n* Devil\'s Washboard - interesting rock formation which is probably best to view at low tide. The island surrounded by it seems lovely too.\n* Sun Messe Nichinan – the Moai statues (only permitted replicas in the world) are an obvious draw, but surrounded by a theme park, made into a touristy gimmick… not sure if it’s worth it.\n* Cape Toi – a nice place with views made even better by the fact there are wild roaming horses all around.\n* Udo Jingu - another coastal shrine in a cave. You can try hitting a target with wishing stones for good luck.\n* Wakoen Harada Honten– there are many tea shops and plantations in Japan, this one caught my eye because it’s almost like a winery (but for tea). They can show you the factory, plantation and do some workshops like hojicha roasting. Sadly, not enough time for it. 大隅茶全, another tea shop half an hour from there looked promising too.\n\n**Kumamoto**\n\nI haven’t been to this city at all, so I can’t tell you much about it. It’s a standard modern city with few attractions and many people use it as a starting point to visit Mount Aso. Also, the local mascot Kumamon is quite famous. Based on my research, it can be skipped without regrets. Even in the promotional video from Japan guide it doesn’t seem particularly interesting.\n\n* Kumamoto Castle – impressive castle, unfortunately severely damaged by the earthquake since 2016 and repairs will last till around 2038. Whether it’s worth visiting in its current state is for you to decide, unless it’s Sakura season in which it’s a must go.\n* Suizenji Garden – nice garden including a mini Mount Fuji\n* One piece statues – if you are a fan of One Piece, you will be interested by the bronze statues spread around the city and beyond\n\n**Kirishima Kinkowan National Park**\n\nThis place is a hiker’s paradise. You can do a wide range of hikes of various length and difficulty, so everyone can find one for themselves here, I list some below. Keep in mind it’s still a volcanic area so some trails might be temporarily closed due to volcanic activity\n\n1. Hike to Mount Karakuni  (500m elevation, 4km). I did this hike and despite the winter conditions in the upper part I will never forget the amazing view from the top. I will also not forget the amazing foot bath after at the tourist center. This hike can be extended into the whole Kirishima Ridge Trail, which is the king line here, 12km long in total.\n2. Go to ONAMI-IKE LAKE which is an easier hike (200m elevation, 2km)\n3. Do a very easy loop around Two Lakes Observatory (100 m elevation, 2 km)\n4. Hike to the top of Mt. Takachiho (600m elevation, 6km). There is a ruin of a destroyed temple on the way.\n\n* Maruo Falls - waterfalls for just a few min stop\n* Kirishima Jingu – nice shrine with impressive trees around, a bit of a taster what is to come in Yakushima.\n* Onsens – there are many ryokans where you can stay overnight or just bathe in the onsen. Haven’t been.\n* If you’re Ghibli fan, don’t miss the Tonari no Totoro Bus Stop . It’s a life size statue with a beautiful background, and the owners (who made the statue themselves) even left an umbrella here so everyone can get the classic picture.\n* Stayed at Guesthouse Coco Garage – the best equipped mountain cabin I have ever seen, including a massage chair. It’s very nice and spacious.\n* Food: *きりしま月の舟 –* cute café with an impressive library run by a Japanese couple that met in the UK. \n\n**Kagoshima**\n\nLovely city right next to a towering volcano, which tends to erupt from time to time, no big deal. Two things caught my eye - Suica doesn’t work on trams and a lot of people look ethnically different. Upon research, it seems to be the Ryukyuans. I had just half a day and really wish I could spend more time here.\n\n* Sakurajima – you can get to this volcano with a short ferry. One of the recommended activities is renting bikes to go for 3 hours around the volcano, checking out the observation points, villages and a buried shrine gate. Going on a sea kayak tour seemed like an interesting option too. Haven’t been\n* Sengan-en – beautiful Japanese garden with a spectacular view of Sakurajima, also some historic buildings here and a museum. Haven’t been\n* Shiroyama Park Observation Deck  - if you want another view of the volcano and Kagoshima, this is the place. Haven’t been\n* 展望露天温泉 さつま乃湯 – or maybe you want to look at Sakurajima from an onsen? Haven’t been\n* Miyama- A small pottery village originally settled by potters from Korea. You can see and buy pottery or see glass blowing too.\n* Satsuma Peninsula – potential side trip if you want to try the hot sand bath, see a samurai district or a museum about kamikaze pilots\n* **Food**:\n* Kikaku Sushi – Kagoshima is generally cheaper so it makes sense to go for an Omakase here\n* Sueyoshi – great eel restaurant, again, cheap, and very good\n* Also consider trying some tonkatsu as Kagoshima is famous for it\n\n**Yakushima**\n\nIf there’s one takeaway I want you to take from this post, it is: you HAVE TO see Yakushima. This is not only one of the best places in Kyushu, but possibly in whole of Japan. The nature is absolutely beautiful here, and it’s best explored through hikes which I list below (none require a guide). But even if you’re not into hiking, you can still see some beautiful trees, wild monkeys, waterfalls, beaches…a fascinating side of Japan you won’t experience on the golden route. I will definitely be back to do some more hiking (and also bouldering as I found there’s a climbing guidebook).\n\nI have mentioned earlier that renting a car is recommended. While you can use the buses, it will limit you significantly, especially timing-wise, determining when you can go to hikes and when do you need to return. Also, you won’t be able to make stops at interesting places on the way. The way we did it is fly in from Kagoshima, the rental car company was already waiting for us and took us to their office.\n\nNote that some roads or hikes can be closed due to the consequences of the summer typhoon, so always check on current trail conditions before you arrive.\n\n* Yakusugi Museum – many people recommend you start here so you can have a full understanding of the unique forests in Yakushima. Haven’t been.\n* Yakusugi Land – great introduction to the forest of Yakushima. The basic loop is quite short but takes you on a comfortable wooden walkway, from which you can see the beautiful cedar trees, some of which are over 1000 years old. The 30 or 50 minute courses are a perfect choice if you’re not into hiking, the latter encountering a nice suspension bridge across the gorge. What I didn’t know is that there are options to extend these loops, either to an 80 minute one (which I did and it was lovely, but definitely didn’t take so long), or even a 150 minute course. If that wasn’t enough, you can hike all the way to the top of Tachudake, which is an impressive rock sticking out of the jungle like a raised thumb. When you return to the parking, check out the very old Kigensugi Cedar which is further up the road.\n* Shiratani Unsui Gorge – probably the most famous hike on Yakushima. The main trail (5km, 400m elevation) goes slowly up the mountain. This gorge inspired the Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke, and I understand why now. The higher you hike, the more interesting it gets. It’s hard to describe it, there is just so much green everywhere with all the ancient trees covered in moss. Eventually you get up to the Taikoiwa Rock where you are rewarded by a stunning view of the inland mountains. One of the best hikes I’ve done in my life.\n* Jōmon Sugi – for Japanese people, this hike might be even more famous than the prior hike. Going to the oldest tree in Japan is considered a must-do pilgrimage, like hiking to the top of Mt. Fuji. I haven’t done this hike so I can only tell you that most of it follows along old railroad tracks, and only towards the end it gets exciting when it turns into a proper steep hiking trail. It’s 20 km total with 800m elevation, so quite a long hike and not sure if it’s as rewarding as the Shiratani Unsui one.\n* Other hikes – there are other less popular options that become clear when you look at Strava Heatmaps. You can go to Mount Motchomu, Mount Aiko, Janokuchi Waterfall or a completely alternate trail to Jōmon Sugi from the north. But the hike deserving the most attention is the one going to Mount Miyanoura (14km, 800m elevation + Mount Kuromi can be added) where you see a different kind of Yakushima, since the terrain changes to alpine and your view isn’t covered by trees.\n* Linkups are an option too, a popular one is doing Shiratani Unsui with Jōmon Sugi in one hike. This is a one day epic with 19km and 1200m elevation – so only for experienced hikers. My personal plan for next time in Yakushima is to combine Mount Miyanoura with Jōmon Sugi so that you don’t have to return the same way you came and you have a nice hike with 22km and 920 elevation.\n\nNow that we covered the hikes, we can look at the second attraction of Yakushima, which is seeing all the interesting sports around the island. I recommend seeing them in one epic round trip. The driving itself will take around 2 hours, but depending on how many places you visit you may need 4 hours or more. I list the places going from Miyanoura clockwise.\n\n* Yakushima Hachimanju Tea Garden – local tea shop with a wide selection of products and delicious matcha ice-cream. You can check their tea fields right behind the shop.\n* Hanii kiln – very cool pottery workshop hidden in the nature – follow the signs at the road, don’t trust google maps directions. I really regret I bought only one cup here.\n* Yakusugi Woodcraft Factory – probably the best souvenir shop on the island with a huge display of products made of the local cedar wood.\n* Three waterfalls - all of them in one area, with Senpiro Falls being the most impressive. You can comfortably see it from the parking lot or walk down to the valley to see it up closer. Ryujinno-taki Falls aren’t interesting at all, but nearby you can check the “secret” waterfall which is in a lovely valley. Finally, Torohki falls are nice with the water falling directly into the sea.\n* Banyan trees- you can check these strange trees at either Sarukawa banyan tree or Shitoko Gajumaru Banyan Park.\n* Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen – a unique onsen that is available only twice a day at low tide. It is an amazing feeling, sitting in a hot onsen pool with water from the sea coming in. People who find standard onsens too hot will especially love this one, as the temperature gets lower thanks to the sea. This is a mixed onsen, so you’re expected to cover yourself with a towel or light cloth.\n* Yakushima Fruit Garden - “Papaya no Sato” – used to be a nice garden where the owner would show you around, but as they are getting old, you have to explore on your own. The owner still makes a fruit plate for you which is nice.\n* Ohko Waterfall – you can get pretty close to this nice waterfall\n* World Heritage Listed Coastal Road with Wildlife – shortly after the Ohko waterfall, the road gets narrow, and you get surrounded by nature. Not only by trees and rocks, but also monkeys and deer. Drive very slowly here and be mindful of the animals on the road - they will often chill in the middle of it and pretend they don’t see you, but they will back off when you come closer. Also be on alert for spots where you can move to the side if you encounter a car from the opposite direction. All of this might sound intimidating but it’s a great experience.\n* Inakahama Beach -  after surviving the coastal road, you are rewarded by seeing the nicest beach on Yakushima. Not only can you chill and swim here, but during summer can also see turtles laying eggs or their babies hatching.\n* **Food**:\n* Panorama – modern izakaya. Still not sure what that means, but now I know it’s not for me. Portions are very small for the price (tapas style), and while the service is super nice, the food is nothing special and I regret going here.\n* 小花 – standard izakaya, food was okayish\n* 喜来里 – decent food here, big portions\n* Yakushima Airport Restaurant – didn’t expect to have my best meal at Yakushima here, but the udon set with flying fish was super good and I enjoyed watching the cute little airplanes. This is a good place to load up on souvenirs too.\n* Hiro Bakery – you should definitely try the rice flour bread, so good that we went to this bakery twice!\n* Wakadaisho – decent sushi place that I didn’t get to try \n\nThat’s it!

I no longer DJ around town because it requires way too much networking/schmoozing/partying and with my 9-5 I mostly feel like cozying up at home and going to bed early these days.\n\nBackground: I have a bachelor\'s degree in physics. My dad gave me $300/mo in college, totaling about $15,000.\n\nJob: Analyst in O&amp;G. My job is super boring looking at numbers all day, sending out reports, and filing regulatory reports. I got laid off from my remote job in January, got a new job in March that is 100% in office and I forgot how much a commute + gym makes me so tired at the end of the day. But yay I have health insurance for only $50/mo! I max out my 401k ($2606/mo) so my paychecks NET 2x per month = $2530. I already maxed out my IRA for this year.\n\nCash Assets: $265k IRA + $15K brokerage + $5k CD + $8K HYSA + $20k 401K = $313k\n\nRental Income: in 2020 the landlord of the condo I was renting decided to retire and sell his properties so I bought it for $95K with $20k down, 3.75% interest. Its now worth approx. $125k and I owe probably about $60k. It basically breaks even or at a slight loss after maintenance and vacancy but I keep it as a future snowbird property when I retire in hopefully 10 years and move partially back to the cold Midwest state I am from. Mortgage + HOA + HVAC maint is $1110 and I rent it out for $1395. Last week I spent $700 on a new dishwasher, washing machine, and repairs to the downstairs neighbor after an appliance leaked.\n\nHouse: purchased in 2021. Cost $285K, put $20K down, 2.75% interest, worth approx. $330K, owe approx. $250k\n\nCar: unfortunately my old beater was totaled last year so I had to buy a new car. 2022 Toyota for $26k cash. I hope this car also lasts me at least 20 years!\n\nDEBT: $5.5K on a 0% interest credit card until Aug 2026: $1500 is from a cross country road trip we took this last summer, $2k in medical expenses for my IPL eye treatments, $1000 is a \"time share preview year\" I purchased for fun when we stayed at a time share resort. The rest is some dental work and groceries.\n\nExpenses:\n\n$1830 Mortgage PITA (includes $55 PMI)  \n\n$180ish Electric average (varies between 80 to 280)  \n\n$40-ish natural gas. \n\n$55-ish water although it was 100 last month because I left the outdoor spigot on oops!  \n\n$20 sewer line insurance. \n\n$15 HVAC maintenance plan for 2x per year cleaning/checkups. \n\n$200 car insurance: full coverage for 2 people plus a $1MM Umbrella policy. \n\n$40 pet insurance for dog. \n\n$43 gym membership; plus a one time yearly fee of $55. \n\n$4 Hulu/Disney black Friday deal baby. \n\n$5 PBS. \n\n$7 Sirius Radio. \n\n$13 Spotify. \n\n$11 B12 supplement subscription. \n\n$15 Youtube; I think there may be a way to combine this with google storage for a cheaper total monthly fee that I will look into.\n  \n$35 Internet. \n\n$40 Ad-hoc donations. Last month was PBS, this month was a coworker\'s family funeral expenses and a friend\'s cancer fundraiser, and next month will probably be to buy groceries for my best friend who relies on SNAP to feed her kids. I often use my Boost to send flowers and food to friends who are ill/have surgery.  \n\n$200/year Mint Mobile. \n\n$20/year Google storage. \n\n$85/year Britbox; not sure I will renew since I have PBS, but I love my period dramas and detective mysteries. \n\n$30/year Kroger Boost (normally 60 but they gave me a discount coupon this year)  \n\n$14/year Amazon recently offered me a year for $14, so I thought I\'d try it to have access to all the movies and tv shows I want to see, but I\'ve since discovered you still have to pay to rent most of them! What a ripoff! I will not be renewing! Prior to this I was using the free shipping that my Dad shared with me, but they are doing away with that, and I will definitely be boycotting them going forward.\n\nI aim to add at least $500 to savings every month.\n\nMy boyfriend of 5 years, Novio lives with me but is currently unemployed again for going on 5 months and not paying bills. He normally contributes $1k for rent/utilities/groceries/insurance.\n\nDiary:\n\nSaturday: Spent several hours flipping heavy logs in my backyard from a tree I had cut down to dolly them out of the yard. The power company cut it down for free since it was on a power line. Called my dad to ask him to come over (he lives 1 hour away) at some point in the future to chainsaw up the tree trunk. I\'m sure I will buy him lunch. Frugal win! Novio broke his hand recently so he stayed inside and made burgers for lunch. My friend called me last minute to ask if I wanted to go to Ren Fest with her tomorrow so she doesn\'t have to go alone. I am trying to save money but decide YOLO and say yes. I went to the thrift store and buy some clothes, house decor, and a few items of clothing for Novio to wear to ren fest since he\'s not a costume guy, but he will wear something if I get it for him. Got him a green hooded vest to pair with some harem pants I got him previously. I used a 40% off coupon and spent $40. Bought my ren fest ticket for $30. Novio paid for his own ticket. He asks me if I will buy him some skittles on the way home lol so I stop at the grocery and get a big bag for $2.70. Tired from the yardwork so we just cuddle the pets and watched some movies: My Name is Bruce and Ash Vs Evil Dead. Its a tricky balance act to get the pets in their preferred spots on Mamma without touching each other, or they will erupt in chaos. Perrito and Thing 1 cannot even stand to look at each other or all hell will break loose, so there is a pillow wedged between them to block their sight. No one cuddles with Novio because he is Not The Mamma. I cracked open one of my Aldi pumpkin ciders. I\'m not usually a fan of pumpkin spice anything because I am allergic to cinnamon, but this mostly tastes like sweet hard cider with a hint of allspice.\n\nSunday: Walked Perrito for an hour. He lives for this, but he is an old chihuahua with back problems so  we only go once in awhile. Gave my friend $20 for gas and tolls. Brought a refillable water bottle, granola bars, and Perfect bar in my bag for the Fest to save some coin (turkey legs are $23 this year!). We went to the burlesque show which my friend paid for previously. She wouldn\'t accept any money from me, but I found a reflexology massage punch card in my wallet with one massage left and gave it to her (worth approx. $30 previously purchased). Felt like I was fading after hours of walking so I had a glass of coke at the show and tipped the server ($5). I had some bites of my friend\'s turkey leg and Novio\'s sausage on a stick, and ate my snacks. Said hi to some friends working and performing. $10 for 2 entries to the medieval torture museum. 17k steps! I dressed up as a mushroom fairy with LED wings for the Fairy theme, and used some white clown makeup to dot my face.  \n\nMonday: Very exhausted from this weekend. I always pack leftovers and homemade cold brew for lunch, but didn\'t prepare anything due to my busy weekend. Bought a trenta iced coffee at Starbucks with some bonus points I had been saving, drank 1/4, and scavenged emergency desk and freezer meals I keep at work. Slept an hour in my car at lunch. Went home and vegetated. Novio grilled skirt steak fajitas. Watched Ash vs Evil Dead.\n\nTuesday: Woke up with a terrible sore throat. Oh that\'s why I was so worn out yesterday. Got a notification some supplements (L-theanine and probiotics) shipped from Amazon subscribe and save. I am slowly working on finding replacements for ordering from Amazon so this is way less than I used to order. $37. My usual breakfast is that I dump 2 packets of gf brown sugar instant oatmeal in a jar, add water, and its ready to eat when I get to work. Work, slept in my car at lunch, feeling better so went to yoga at my gym in the evening. Picked up some items from my Buy Nothing group. A turkey rack for my roasting pan and a disco ball wine bottle cork. Novio made ground beef tacos and homemade pinto beans for Taco Tuesday. More Evil Dead.\n\nWednesday: Go to change the litter robot and realize I am out of cat litter. $108 Chewy order for world\'s best lotus scented corn litter. Expensive little shits. Literally. Work, short power nap in my car at lunch, and went swimming at the gym afterwards. Novio made a roast chicken and rice for dinner. He took the car to help his cousin with something so I watched Ripper Street and read a few chapters of All Creatures Great and Small before bed.\n\nThursday: Finally finished my Starbucks iced coffee! Wasted some time at work looking at doorbell cameras. I live near a sketchy part of town so I have to deal with people trying to squat in the vacant property and lot next door, theft, asking for money, etc. The one I want is $90 on Amazon but I\'m trying to avoid them so I find the same one at local Microcenter but its $120! I try to decide if its worth an extra $30 to boycott Amazon. I leave it in my cart and don\'t buy it yet since I just splurged on a special pillow, silk pillowcase, and organic tea leaves last week as my monthly \"splurge\". Shoutout to David\'s Organic Teas for reasonably priced organic leaves. One of my favorite amazon replacement companies. Also, I discover my dashcam I just recently installed stopped working, but Novio offers to look at the fuse box installation before I call the company for help. He is very handy and has saved me thousands of dollars on plumbing, construction, and car repairs. Ordered groceries for delivery tomorrow to take advantage of the Boost rebate and extra fuel points. If I spend $175 each week for 3 weeks, they give me $70 back. $166 for chuck roasts, apple cider, burgers, fruits, veggies, lactose free milk, gf pizza, beef bacon, beans, razors, charcoal, gf oatmeal packets, gf sourdough, frozen gf burritos for work, cat food, pop and snacks for my delivery drivers, and a giant pumpkin to take pictures with Perrito. Today I actually felt rested! So I went to the gym at work on my lunch break. 70! Pushups PR!, barbell squats, and recline bike. Novio made burgers for dinner. I walk Perrito, more Evil Dead episodes, and strategic cuddling.\n\nMy absurdly expensive Pillow Cube arrived and I eagerly try it out and it works great! No \"neck crunchies\" in the morning! That\'s what I call it when I wake up on a flat deflated pillow and my painful neck cracks loudly several times when I move it back into place.\n\nFriday: Mornings are always chaotic trying to feed 3 terrors and pack my breakfast and lunch. Today I brought a water bottle full of cold brewed black tea. Trying to cut down on my coffee consumption. Novio drives me to work so he can borrow my car for a job interview. The dash cam randomly starts working again! I ate my leftover burger early and I\'m feeling snacky so on my lunch break I take a long walk to the grocery and buy imitation crab, laughing cow, a HUGE container of organic blueberries, and a cucumber. $15. Its gorgeous out but I underestimate how humid it is for an hour walk and arrive back super sweaty. I roasted a turkey I got on sale last week for .99/lb. We\'ll eat some and use the rest for homemade dog food. Only the best for Prince Perrito! Novio dropped me at home and drove to 2 Autozones to return a defective car part and find the correct one for me. I dragged him out to Noche Caliente at a bar with a huge outdoor patio and live bands, he bought 2 drinks but 1 was half price. I went to bed but Novio stayed up all night making a flyer for a friend\'s cancer fundraiser.\n\nSaturday: Bicycled to gym and swam. Made turkey pozole for lunch. Novio and I drove to his parents so that he can help his dad and son fix and borrow their second car. His car died years ago but we both worked remotely at the time so we just shared my car until now. Gas $16. Boost gives me $1 off per gallon. His mom made Mexican rice, beans, ground beef and potatoes. Drove home through a huge storm and saw a lot of stranded drivers sitting in flood waters. We had to go around one part through a parking lot.\n\nSunday: Picked up some glass mushroom containers from Marketplace, $20. I was really worn out from the previous day and it took all of my being not to treat myself to my favorite takeout and coffee. Took a nap, picked up a bookcase from Buy Nothing, had to buy new bungee cables to attach it to my roof rack. Had to drive back to his parents to pick up the car after his son fixed the catalytic converter. $10.\n\n\n\nTotal: $463.7. Pretty typical week except for the festival and litter, but I often have some sort of small home maintenance or pet expense. We eat out only 1x per month \n\nPet tax: [Things 1&amp;2](https://postimg.cc/8JFBkyRV)\n[Perrito](https://postimg.cc/w7WXJ8wh)', 'Quark86d', 'MoneyDiariesACTIVE', 'https://reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1ohntzz/im_39_make_110000_as_an_analyst_in_houston_went/', 64, 36, '2025-10-28 01:23:12', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),
(12, 'reddit', '1oa16m9', 'Population Control: The End of the World or The Solution to Our Problems? (There’s only one reason for overshoot, and it’s not the one you might think)', '[The first sunburn of the year always feels like a mistake you should’ve seen coming.](https://medium.com/the-new-climate/population-control-the-end-of-the-world-or-the-solution-to-our-problems-6ad9c8111603) You stay on the beach a little too long, convinced your winter skin can take it, and by nightfall, you’re radiating heat like a broken stove. That’s overshoot: going beyond limits, not on purpose, but because you didn’t recognize where the line was until it burned you.\n\nIt happens everywhere, every day. You down too many espressos before an exam, and your hands shake uncontrollably. You crank the thermostat in mid-winter, only to sleep with the windows wide open hours later. You pile your plate at an all-you-can-eat buffet and realize halfway through the meal that your body has no intention of finishing what your appetite promised. We all overshoot, often enough that we’ve learned to deal with it — like when we test the water before stepping into the shower. Most of the time, the damage is trivial: a sunburn, a hangover, a bad night’s sleep.\n\nScale that pattern up to the entire planet, though, and the consequences may turn brutal.\n\nSustainable living requires staying within the regenerative capacity of the biosphere. In 1961, our collective footprint used [70% of Earth’s capacity](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.142033699). By the end of the 20th century, we had [blown past 120%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.142033699). Today, our species devours the equivalent of [1.8 Earths every year](https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/). One planet, drained at almost twice its rate of regeneration. We are the shrimp-red sunbather, the trembling caffeine addict, the party-goer having one too many drinks — except this time, there’s no morning after to recover.\n\n**Today, our species devours the equivalent of 1.8 Earths every year** (Source: [Earth Overshoot Day](https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/newsroom/past-earth-overshoot-days/))\n\nOvershoot follows the same recipe at any scale: rapid change and growth, hard limits beyond which the system can’t safely go, and a dangerous delay in recognizing you’ve gone too far. These three are necessary and sufficient.\n\nThe change may be technological — an accelerating adoption beyond the available resources. It may be ecological — expansion of farmland into fragile ecosystems that cannot sustain intensive farming. It may be social — a continuously expanding network of connections and consumption that fragments attention and strains real relationships.\n\nThe limits are just as diverse — defined by carrying capacity, by regeneration rate, by thresholds of human adaptation, or other physical, biological, or psychological features of a system.\n\nThe delays, too, arise in many ways: ignored warning signs, outdated information, moving too slowly, getting tangled in red tape, or misunderstanding how things work. This delay is the killer. A body that doesn’t register that extra drink until it’s too late. Politicians that don’t act on carbon thresholds even decades after climate scientists have sounded the alarm. By then, [momentum locks us into trajectories we can’t easily reverse](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-1-5-c-chimera-is-over-well-burn-through-the-remaining-carbon-budget-by-2027-c3bd35aca173).\n\nOvershoot has only two exits: collapse or correction.\n\nA crash when limits slam back. Or a deliberate, careful easing down. And right now, we’re still accelerating toward the wall, burning through more than one planet at a time.\n\nAnd today, the forces shaping our minds, beliefs, and decisions — media, governments, corporations — want us to believe that the cure to humanity’s overshoot is something that’s been in the works for over half a century: that the world population stops growing, as if sheer numbers alone were the lever that could pull us back from collapse.\n\nIt isn’t.\n\n# Folding The Sheet\n\nTake a sheet of paper and fold it in half. Then again. Then again. With each fold, it thickens: 2, 4, 8, 16 layers. Before long, it’s impossible to bend further — it has physical limits. That’s growth: simple doubling, carried to its breaking point.\n\nGrowth is also the altar we’ve been told to kneel at. Bigger houses, faster cars, fatter economies, more jobs, more stuff. The story goes that growth means progress, and progress means life gets better. Governments call it progress. Corporations call it prosperity. And it has indeed delivered: vaccines, highways, electricity, and for a while, it looked like the only tool sharp enough to cut poverty down to size. That’s how growth became so sacred that we treat it like oxygen: unquestionable, essential, and celebrated.\n\nBut blind pursuit of growth is a boomerang: it circles back, heavier, and smashes the hand that threw it, making most of those problems worse.\n\nBecause, *hello!,* the Earth is finite.\n\nFor the past century, humanity has been folding the sheet of *every* physical thing with reckless abandon. [Population](https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth), possessions, cars ([combustion or electric, doesn’t matter](https://medium.com/southern-winds/the-awakening-why-renewables-cant-stop-collapse-4709b3f71ae1)) — doubled, redoubled, multiplied.\n\nToday, the limits we face aren’t the number of people, cars, anything, in isolation. They’re [the *throughput*](https://medium.com/the-quantastic-journal/we-dont-have-an-energy-supply-problem-we-re-just-burning-it-like-idiots-2c0050a4a04c) — the relentless flow of energy and materials required to keep all those people, cars, and industries running. Extraction on one side, waste and pollution on the other. How fast we can rip minerals from the ground and forests from the soil. How much [carbon and poison we can pump into the atmosphere, rivers, and landfills](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-floods-in-pakistan-are-a-glimpse-of-the-future-weve-engineered-738251934432). Growth collides not just with physical boundaries but with the regenerative absorptive capacities of the world’s sinks (atmosphere, surface water bodies, landfills), the very systems we depend on.\n\n# Money In The Jar vs. A Multiplying Grain Of Rice\n\nMost of us imagine growth as linear — add a mile of highway every week, save a few dollars in a jar every year. Manageable. Predictable. Not dependent on how much of the factor has already accumulated.\n\nNow, think of [this Persian legend](https://www.heartoftheart.org/?p=1230): a courtier presented a beautiful chessboard to his king, asking for it one grain of rice on the first square of a chessboard, two on the second, four on the third. By the 21st square, the demand was already over a million grains. By the 41st, a trillion. By the 64th, more rice than the planet could produce. That’s how [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth) blindsides us — it looks manageable, until suddenly it isn’t.\n\n[Weather extremes, economic fluctuations](https://medium.com/southern-winds/earth-in-2024-wrapped-yes-climate-change-will-probably-kill-you-b1b5550d0c08), technical change, [epidemics, or civil disruption](https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/a-warming-world-is-a-sicker-world-36a4e126aece) may impose small ups and downs on the curves, but on the whole, the modern human socioeconomic system is built on this doubling machine. [Three percent annual economic growth](https://www.aei.org/economics/accelerating-to-three-percent-economic-growth/) sounds harmless until you realize it means doubling the size of the economy every 23 years. There is a relationship between the rate of growth, the factor that has already accumulated, and the time it will take a quantity to double.\n\nPopulation and capital fuel this acceleration.\n\nMoney making more money, fossil fuels enabling more machines to extract more fossil fuels, people demanding more and more, push the line steeper in a self-reproducing, growth-oriented fashion, no matter how close the edge.\n\nAnd remember, overshoot has only two exits:\n\n* Option 1: Controlled slowdown — We consciously bringing [the throughputs that support human activities down to sustainable levels](https://medium.com/the-quantastic-journal/we-dont-have-an-energy-supply-problem-we-re-just-burning-it-like-idiots-2c0050a4a04c) through better choices, and reorganizing how we live and work.\n* Option 2: Crash into the wall — We keep accelerating until [nature forces a painful correction](https://medium.com/southern-winds/weve-become-the-human-asteroid-and-this-won-t-be-a-soft-landing-b18ce68b58fe) through resource depletion (running out of food, energy, materials) or through climate feedback loops that spiral beyond our control. Exhibit A: [sea ice vanishes in the summer heat](https://medium.com/southern-winds/its-antarctica-or-planetary-collapse-6f716f8ddb07), exposing dark ocean water that absorbs sunlight instead of reflecting it, which bakes the poles faster, melting even more ice. The planet’s reflective shield transforms into heat-trapping armor, the snake eats its tail, and suddenly [the whole circle is on fire.](https://medium.com/the-environment/2025-wont-be-the-hottest-on-record-but-that-s-no-comfort-at-all-5c9d72ee8d27)\n\nYes, humanity has managed to pull back before. The [Montreal Protocol](https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol) is proof that cooperation and foresight can avert disaster. But that story is the exception, not the rule — and it illustrates the three ingredients of overshoot perfectly: rapid growth (in ozone-killing chemicals), hard limits (a thinning atmosphere), and deadly delays (scientific warnings ignored for years).\n\nWhich leaves us here: facing the first cause of overshoot — runaway growth — in a finite world. And still, we’re told the problem isn’t the throughput, the obscene levels of consumption of a species folding the same sheet of paper, pretending it will never tear. We’re told it’s just the number of people. That if population growth slows, the crisis will vanish.\n\nIt won’t.\n\n# The Vanishing Lineage\n\nMy name is Ricardo. So was my father’s. And his father’s. And his father’s. Four generations of Ricardos, each inheriting not just a name but the weight of continuity.\n\nBut here the tradition stops. My great-grandfather had seven siblings. My grandfather had 13. My father had four. I have one sister — and the neighbours’ dog I sometimes babysit. [That’s the end of the line](https://medium.com/the-new-climate/the-climate-dilemma-should-i-have-children-in-a-future-of-unprecedented-extremes-6f04fbc649d3).\n\nThe pyramid has flipped, but my family isn’t the exception — more like the perfect example of our historical population growth.\n\nIn 1600, the [world held half a billion people](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population?time=1600..latest), with a doubling time of nearly 240 years. By 1900, it was 1.6 billion, with a doubling time of about 100 years. By 1965, when the population was at 3.3 billion, the doubling time had gone down to almost a third, or about 36 years. The number of people in the world grew not only exponentially from 1600, but in fact superexponentially — the rate of growth was itself growing, and for a cheerful reason: [death rates were falling](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy). Birth rates were also falling, but more slowly. Therefore, the population surged.\n\nBetween 1965 and 2000, Earth’s population nearly doubled from 3.3 billion to 6 billion people, but the pace of growth actually fell from 2 to 1.2 percent per year. Today, with over 8.2 billion of us sharing the planet, we’re still adding about 70 million people yearly (roughly the population of [Thailand](https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+Thailand&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)), but that [growth is steadily losing momentum](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).\n\nAs seen with the Ricardos’ lineage, Fertility rates have been [falling for more than 50 years](https://ourworldindata.org/global-decline-fertility-rate). The [global average hovers just above replacement](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/population-limiting-factors-17059572/) (the threshold needed to maintain a steady population) at 2.2. Anything above the 2.1 threshold will theoretically generate exponential expansion, and anything below it will generate exponential decay. So small changes in these numbers can have strong effects. If each pair of adults only has 1.5 children on average, our population would shrink by two-thirds every century. Well, by 2050, [three-quarters of countries will fall below it](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00550-6/fulltext).\n\nThe slope has turned into [a demographic cliff](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality).\n\nThe drivers are everywhere: [contraception](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-3198-3_2), [money stress](http://www.unfpa.org/swp2025), [declining sperm counts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/17742/), shifting [social norms](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0003122418795856), [women reclaiming autonomy](https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/131/638/2478/6226660), even [porn reshaping desire](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8569536/). Governments now [beg for babies](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1d106f7e-aca1-4c0e-ac7a-d35d0772707d), dangling cash, housing, or tax breaks like coupons nobody redeems.\n\nBut the silence is spreading. Playgrounds are quieter than they used to be, and schools are consolidating classrooms.\n\n[China’s population might already](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population) have peaked around 2022, at 1.4 billion. [India’s could do the same](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-population-to-peak-in-early-2060s-to-17-billion-before-declining-united-nations/article68395623.ece) in the early 2060s, reaching 1.7 billion before declining. Cuba is projected to lose over 15% of its population by 2050. Even the [Nordic countries](http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:700593/FULLTEXT01.pdf) — long celebrated as models of gender equality, family-friendly policies, and social cohesion — are seeing their birth rates steadily decline.\n\n**Map of the year that the net reproduction rate falls below the replacement level** (Source: [Fertility, mortality, migration, and population scenarios for 195 countries and territories from 2017 to 2100](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30677-2/fulltext#fig1))\n\nBut no country illustrates this like [South Korea](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/03/the-population-implosion). Its fertility rate plummeted from 4.5 in 1970 to [0.72](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/28/south-korea-fertility-rate-2023-fall-record-low-incentives) in 2024 — the lowest on Earth. Daycares are now nursing homes. [Dog strollers](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/east-asia/baby-stroller-dog-south-korea-low-birth-rate-b2614903.html) outsell those for children. By 2100, the country’s population is expected to be half of what it is today.\n\nMeanwhile, [sub-Saharan Africa is the notable exception](https://www.unicef.org/burundi/press-releases/sub-saharan-africa-faces-unique-challenges-safeguarding-childrens-futures-amid). Nigeria had 36 million people in 1950, 125 million in 2000, and [over 223 million today](https://www.google.com/search?q=nigeria+population). By 2050, it’s set to grow another 76%, vaulting into the world’s top three. By century’s end, more than half the world’s babies may be born there, in a region with some of the weakest health systems and most fragile food supplies.\n\nRich countries are like families with a fully-paid house, savings accounts, and steady jobs. They’ve got their basic needs covered, so they can invest extra money in growing their wealth rather than just keeping the lights on. With fewer kids to raise, they can focus resources on economic growth instead of building more schools and hospitals. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle of prosperity.\n\nOn the other hand, poorer countries must use most of their resources just to provide the basic needs for their growing populations. With little left for economic development, they stay trapped in slow growth. When women lack education and job opportunities, having children becomes one of their few available investments for the future. The result is a growing population without growing prosperity.\n\nLike the old saying goes: *“The rich get richer and the poor get children.”*\n\nSure, we are living longer. But the demographic future is [a ticking recalibration](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/australias-mothers-babies/contents/focus-population-groups/mothers-aged-under-20-and-their-babies) of what it means to build, age, work, love, retire, or even exist in a functioning society.\n\nWe were promised [collapse](https://beyond.ubc.ca/what-is-societal-collapse-and-why-does-it-matter/) by overcrowding. However, the panic about too many people is giving way to a quieter fear: what happens when [the population pyramid flips](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59899), and the weight of our systems sits on a shrinking base?\n\nGlobal population is projected to peak at around [10.3 billion](https://population.un.org/wpp/assets/Files/WPP2024_Summary-of-Results.pdf) in the [next 30–60 years](https://iiasa.ac.at/news/feb-2024/population-and-human-capital-projections-to-2100), then decline — one of the first such declines since the [Black Death](https://beyond.ubc.ca/what-is-societal-collapse-and-why-does-it-matter/) in the 1300s.\n\nThen, what does that mean?  \n*The end of the world or the solution to our overshooting problems?*\n\n# There’s Only One Reason For Overshoot\n\nSo yes, you might be tempted to cheer falling birth rates as a win. Fewer people, fewer emissions, fewer mouths. A tidy solution for overshoot, right?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nJust because two things happen at the same time (population growth and [planetary overshoot](https://medium.com/southern-winds/weve-become-the-human-asteroid-and-this-won-t-be-a-soft-landing-b18ce68b58fe)) doesn’t mean one directly causes the other. Sure, [population growth does contribute](https://drawdown.org/sectors/health-and-education) to ecological strain. But [depopulation doesn’t fix climate change](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6114924/). It doesn’t bring back forests, or reverse extinction, or dismantle inequality. Especially when driven not by sustainability but by [anxiety, precarity, and burnout](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/17742/).\n\nWe’ve been fed that “[people are the problem](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-overpopulation-crisis-might-be-over-soon-just-don-t-expect-it-to-solve-our-problems-0fdfb781254a).” However, this narrative conveniently blames newborns — especially the poor, Black, rural, and southern — while an oppressive, predatory minority consumes like emperors and demands the rest of us keep the furnaces roaring. We would need [more than five Earths](https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/) if everyone lived like people living in the United States, but just 0.7 if we lived like Nigerians. But hey, let’s put the blame on the rising population, just like blaming a crowded bus for traffic while ignoring the single-passenger luxury SUVs taking up most of the road.\n\nSo why does the myth keep coming back?\n\nBecause it’s simple. Because it feels scientific. Because it lets the [systems off the hook](https://medium.com/southern-winds/texas-flash-flooding-the-blame-only-points-one-way-1c8c821558c4) — the [supply chains, the fossil fuels](https://medium.com/policy-panorama/heineken-in-ethiopia-an-island-of-perfection-in-a-sea-of-misery-719ed2f7a3fe), the billionaires, the borders, the bankers. And because, for over a century, population control has been a proxy war: a polite veneer over fear of race, class, migration, and control. *“Too many people”* has become [an embedded scapegoat in our beliefs](https://medium.com/southern-winds/making-sense-of-this-mess-cd7f920af863), while [the real wreckers profit](https://medium.com/the-environment/antarcticas-fall-the-most-alarming-environmental-shift-of-the-decade-6e728205574f) and pollute.\n\nAnd so, generation after generation, the lie survives. [Blaming poverty on family size](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1450291/full) while ignoring colonial theft. [Blaming instability on fertility rates](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-end-of-chinas-one-child-policy/) while propping up authoritarian policies. Even [Nature’s latest coverage](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02615-6) avoids fossil fuels and consumption habits and instead speaks about resilience and adaptation, and begs for “a stable economy.”\n\n*Seriously?*\n\nThe only reason for overshoot is what a powerful [slice of humanity is doing with an outsized portion of our energy](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-top-1-of-emitters-produce-over-1000-times-more-co2-than-the-bottom-1) — and intends to keep doing so. Globally, the top 10% of emitters are responsible for almost half of global energy-related CO2 emissions, compared with a mere 0.2% for the bottom 10%. Even more, the world’s [top 1% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-top-1-of-emitters-produce-over-1000-times-more-co2-than-the-bottom-1). And still, our imagination is so colonized that we’d rather force women to have fewer children than force billionaires to have fewer yachts.\n\n**The top 10% is responsible for almost half of the worlds emissions** (Source: [IEA](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-top-1-of-emitters-produce-over-1000-times-more-co2-than-the-bottom-1))\n\nDepopulation without dismantling the fossil-fueled, profit-driven machine is only a conveniently engineered distraction. Fewer people won’t fix a damn thing if power and wealth keep flowing uphill. Because when the pie shrinks, [inequality only scales](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2022.980677/full).\n\nThe “population problem” was never about numbers. It was about control. About misdirection. About turning wombs into sacrifices for wars, oil fields, and profit.\n\nSome lies are so pervasively effective, they just need to be [repeated often enough](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8h14wa) until they become *the truth*.\n\nWe don’t need to shrink humanity to save the planet.

(13, 'reddit', '1oa8mev', 'Introducing the latest additions to my collection!', 'After going through a challenging time in my personal life, I threw myself into cooking (and into this sub) and I have found a lot of comfort in it. I have loved cooking for a long time but recently went into a bit of cookbook-buying \"craze\" and bought those eight cookbooks in the space of two months! I love all of them and can\'t wait to try more recipes. So I wanted to introduce fellow cookbook lovers to my latest additions!\n\n**Modern Australian Food:** I am French and based in the UK, but I am mad about all things Australian and wanted to bring a little bit of Australia into my kitchen… More recent books have been published - Phaidon’s Australia: The Cookbook and Bill Granger’s Australian Food - but for some reason I didn’t really “connect” with either book. After much searching online I found this 2012 book from Australian Women’s Weekly. It showcases the huge variety of modern Australian cuisine from city café culture to rustic country cooking and refined costal dishes.\n\n*I can’t wait to make…* Seafood laksa. Although it’s a Southeast Asian dish, I always associate it with my time in Australia because the first time I had it was on a plane to Sydney, and I enjoyed seafood laksa many times afterwards while in Oz. I love it and can’t wait to try and replicate the same flavours at home.\n\n**Paella:** Paella has always been my favourite dish. I love rice-based dishes and seafood so when I saw this book I knew I had to have it! Although the author acknowledges that most of his recipes are not “classic” paella recipes, I love the flavour combinations. It’s also a very charming book and has meat, seafood and vegetarian paella options.\n\n*I can’t wait to make*… Red mullet and squid paella.\n\n**Mabu Mabu**: Australia again! The book is by Torres Island chef Nornie Bero, who showcases a lot of native ingredients in her recipes (saltbush, wattleseed, pepperberry, emu, kangaroo…). I bought this book on a whim from a UK bookshop and I have to admit, when I got home and flicked through the recipes, I thought I might need to return it! I felt very “intimidated” by the recipes with ingredients completely unknown to me and which can’t even be found online in the UK. I assumed it might just end up as a nice “coffee table book” that I wouldn\'t use, but I’m heading back to Australia for a holiday soon and I am on a mission to try and find some of ingredients locally.\n\n*I can’t wait to make*… Samur chicken (one of the most accessible recipes with easy-to-find ingredients), then other dishes with native ingredients if I can find them on my next trip. I certainly won’t eat crocodile in the UK, but I still want to try Nornie’s “Saltbush Pepperberry Crocodile” dish – apparently it tastes a bit like salt and pepper squid so I will just substitute croc for squid!\n\n**The Spanish Pantry** I was lucky enough to meet Jose Pizarro at a book festival this summer, and got a signed copy of this book. I love the bold flavours of Spanish cuisine and Jose himself a complete delight to listen to – so friendly and clearly passionate about his food!\n\n*I can’t wait to make…* Lecha frita with caramel oranges.\n\n**LEON’s Big Flavours** – LEON is a UK fast-food restaurant chain with a twist. It focuses on better (but still fast) food, integrating the best of British food with more complex Asian or Middle-Eastern inspired flavours. I also have a positive association with LEON as I’ve only eaten there at airports or petrol stations on my way to exciting trips abroad! Their waffle fries and gochujang chicken wrap are always a winner. I picked this book because it specifically focuses on big, bold flavours and recipes are listed as salty, sweet, sour or spicy (and sometimes all four!).\n\n*I can’t wait to make*… Kimchi mac and cheese.\n\n**The Island Kitchen** I bought this book (along with another small recipe book, Mankafy Sakafo) thanks to recommendations from Redditors, when I asked about finding a book on the [cuisine of Madagascar](https://www.reddit.com/r/CookbookLovers/comments/1n8n0ki/cookbook_on_the_cuisine_of_madagascar/). This is exactly the style of cooking I love – rice-based recipes, rich stews seasoned with delicate spices, coconut and vanilla-based sauces. It is such a beautiful cookbook on one of my favourite parts of the world.\n\nI *can’t wait to make…* I couldn’t wait to make coconut tuna curry from the Maldives, and made it earlier this week. It was delicious and made me want to try more! I’m planning on making lobster with vanilla sauce for the festive season.\n\n**Sauces et accompagnements –** A French-language cookbook on sauces, including classic French sauces, salsas, chutneys and seasoned butters. I wanted to have a reference book on sauces so I could turn a basic dish of meat and fish with rice/vegetables into something different just by changing the sauce.\n\n *I can’t wait to make…* Nantua sauce. It’s a classic French sauce with a creamy tomato and brandy base – very indulgent and delicious with fish.\n\n**The Nutmeg Trail** This is my latest purchase and one of the few cookbooks that I will probably read cover to cover. Not only are the recipes gorgeously illustrated with enticing dishes from around the world, but it also takes the reader on a historic and culinary journey along the spice route. I keep picking it up and just browsing through it dreaming of what to cook next!\n\n*I can’t wait to make…* Royal Saffron Paneer (paneer cooked in in a creamy, subtly spiced sauce with cardamom and saffron)', 'Silent-Translator-27', 'CookbookLovers', 'https://reddit.com/r/CookbookLovers/comments/1oa8mev/introducing_the_latest_additions_to_my_collection/', 78, 24, '2025-10-19 03:56:43', '2025-11-07 23:40:40');

S. is on my health insurance plan and he pays me for his half every two weeks.\n\nS. has his own startup, and pays himself a salary of $100K. I think his monthly take home is around $5K (I don\'t know how their business\'s taxes work).\n\nSalary Progression: I started as an entry-level civil EIT right out of college, making $60K. This was way lower than what I should\'ve been making for a HCOL city, but I graduated in 2020 into an unstable job market so I was grateful to have had a job at all. I went from $60K to $68K to $72K to $86K to $90K over 5 years at the same company. I knew I was grossly underpaid, but I had bad imposter syndrome and felt underqualified to work anywhere else. Then when I got my PE license, I asked for a raise and was given 4%.

S. gets up to make me coffee, and I have toast with peanut butter. Out the door by 8:09, and sadly I miss my bus by about fifteen seconds. \n\n8:30AM - I get settled in at my desk. I always wonder what people actually DO for work all day, so here’s my morning: check comments from the senior engineer on the drainage report I’m writing for Project #1, meet with my manager to plan out my time on Project #2 for the next two months, sit in on an all-discipline design meeting for Project #3, and organize and delegate tasks for junior staff on Project #4. I also eat second breakfast—yogurt with chia pudding, granola, and fruit—between meetings. \n\n12PM - I made a big batch of pasta yesterday to pack for lunches this week, but I go with my coworker to a nearby food court anyway just to get out of the office. I buy a peach iced tea to go with my pesto pasta and chicken. **$4.41**\n\n1PM - Back at my desk for a weekly team check-in. I also have a meeting about Project #5.  After that, I finally have time to actually work, so I block out an hour each for Project #1, #2, and #6. \n\n4PM - I decide to finish the day at home, so I do my timesheet and pack up early. When I get back, I log on and work a bit more (Project #1) before starting dinner. Tonight’s my turn to cook, and I make Thai red curry with chicken and veggies. After dinner, I tell S. I’m craving brownies, so he starts a batch while I finish up more work (Project #4 and #6). \n\n8:30PM - We eat brownies and play the NYT Spelling Bee (and reach Queen Bee!). After much deliberation, I preorder my birthday cake: pistachio dacquoise, white chocolate, and cassis mousse and glaze. **$68**\n\n10PM - S. reads while I watch some YouTube. Shower and lights out by 11. \n\n**Daily total: $72.41**\n\n**Day 2: Tuesday** \n\n5:30AM - Orangetheory, the usual. \n\n7:30AM - Shower, get dressed, do my face. Peanut butter toast, pack my lunch, out the door. I have the routine down to a science, but I’m in a bit of a rush today because I need to be at my desk for an 8:30 meeting (Project #2). I miss my bus again by ten seconds - I need to learn to time this better. \n\n8:30AM - The morning consists of the meeting for Project #2, two meetings for Project #4, meeting for Project #5, and a meeting for Project #1. I eat second breakfast between calls. \n\n1PM - Lunch is the same pesto pasta and chicken, eaten at my desk. S. snuck a brownie into my lunchbox! This afternoon’s docket is Project #1, #4, and #6. #4 is becoming a real headache. I work on redlining some plans and addressing comments on a results report.\n\n4:45PM - Pack up, timesheet, and bus back home. It’s beautiful out today so I decide to walk to get some stuff for dinner. We already did the big grocery run on Sunday, so I get frozen udon, kimchi, instant ramen (Jin is my favorite), hoisin sauce, and some tofu soup kits. **$18.56** (for my half)\n\n6:30PM - I veg out on the couch until S. gets home from tennis. For dinner, I make steak and miso udon salad and we eat while watching Master Chef. We do the Spelling Bee (Queen Bee again!) before I log on and do more work for #4. \n\n10:30PM - In bed and lights out. \n\n**Daily total: $18.56**\n\n**Day 3: Wednesday**\n\n7AM - I miss my alarm!! The Orangetheory no-show fee (plus tax!) charges automatically. This is literally the first time I’ve ever missed a class and of course it’s this week. **$15.45**\n\n8AM - And now somehow, I’m running late for work too. I’m commuting to another office location for an in-person business development meeting, so I have to drive to the park-and-ride and take the train to the office.\n\n12PM - The meeting was three hours, but at least they provided doughnuts. I grab lunch with some coworkers after — I get a turkey pesto crepe. Lots of pesto this week. **$19.72**\n\n1PM - I do work for Project #1, #2, and #4 while snacking on dark chocolate pretzels. By the time I look up from my laptop, it’s 5PM and I’m the last one here. I do my timesheet, pack up, take the train to my car, and drive home. S. has shawarma chicken, cucumber and tomato salad, tzatziki, and pita waiting when I walk in the door. I rant about my day while we eat. \n\n6:30PM - We meet up with some friends at a nearby bar for trivia. I get an apple cider sangria for my first drink and it’s delicious ($9.86). For the second round, I get a hot mulled wine and some buffalo cauliflower, but sadly both are subpar ($40.43). **$50.29**\n\n8:30PM - We got 8th place out of 17 teams! Not too bad. Our friend convinces us all to go to another bar for jazz night and why not, it’s a Wednesday! I ask S. to order us a drink and he comes back indignant. The mango cider was FOURTEEN dollars!! Granted, it’s delicious and 9% ABV. **$7**\n\n9:30PM - The jazz group shows up an hour late, so my friends teach me how to play hearts — turns out I’m surprisingly good. The group finally goes on and it’s Latin night, and at this point I’m a little tipsy and just bopping along to the music. Life is good. \n\n11PM - We get home and all I want to do is flop into bed, but I force myself to tidy the kitchen and prep lunch for tomorrow while S. finishes up his work. Lights out just before midnight. \n\n**Daily total: $92.46**\n\n**Day Four: Thursday**\n\n5:30AM - Oof, I’m feeling ROUGH. But somehow I make it to Orangetheory. \n\n7:30AM - Showered and ready for work. I want something a little heartier today so I make eggs and rice. S. gets up long enough to make coffee and eat some eggs before going back to bed. I miss the bus by a minute - luckily the buses come every 6 minutes, which is why I never check the schedule before I head out. \n\n8:30AM - Between the bus stop and my office, I almost get hit twice: first by a bus running a red light, and then by a pigeon. I have three meetings this morning, all camera off, so I have a chance to eat second breakfast during calls and update my planner.\n\n12PM - Lunch today is spinach and cheese tortellini with tomato sauce. I try not to eat at my desk too often, but I have so much work today for Project #1, #2, and #4. Someone asks to jump on a call, but I push it back a half hour so I have time to eat my brownie. \n\n4PM - End of day rolls around just as I figure out how to properly adjust my chair. I pack up, do my timesheet, and head out. When I get home, S. and I share some frozen Trader Joe’s dumplings while we catch up on two Spelling Bees.\n\n6PM - It’s technicallyyy S.’s turn to cook but he’s working late, so I make the tofu soup kits I picked up on Tuesday and add zucchini, broccoli, frozen pork belly, and ramen. Unconventional, but it’s hot and tasty and filling. We watch Master Chef while we eat, and then veg out for a long time.\n\n9PM - I put away laundry that’s been sitting in the dryer since Sunday, and note how stretched and worn some of my underwear has gotten. Aerie is having buy 4 get 4 free on their underwear, so I pick out 8 pairs plus some boxers for sleeping. **$56.05**\n\n10:30PM - I make the executive decision to not work out tomorrow morning.\n\n**Daily total: $56.05**\n\n**Day Five: Friday**\n\n7:30AM - It feels glorious to sleep in, and even better to know that my commute is one room over. I change into sweatpants and have a bowl of (stale) cereal. I get to have my coffee in a real mug instead of a travel tumbler today, so S. decides to attempt some latte foam art. It’s beautiful to me.\n\n9AM - Log on late today and get started on work. Because I worked extra at the beginning of this week, I technically should only work until 2PM today to bill 40 hours on my timesheet. But I have a sneaking suspicion today will be a full day. I discuss upcoming tasks for Project #5 with my manager, mark up some redlines for #6, and work on the report for #1. \n\n12PM - Lunch is a medley of leftovers: Thai curry with brown rice, shawarma chicken, and the last of the cucumber salad. I also set out a bowl of maple kettle corn and we share the last brownie. We do the Spelling Bee over lunch (third Queen Bee of the week! This is unprecedented). \n\n5:30PM - As predicted, I’ve spent all afternoon finalizing the drainage report for Project #1 (QC is supposed to start on Monday). But I still enter it as 40 hours and submit my timesheet. I send some materials over to the senior engineer to review and take a break for dinner. We meet up with my parents and brothers and, as it usually is with my mom, we order too much. We get multiple bowls of hand-pulled noodles, beef noodle soup, wontons, soup dumplings, and scallion pancakes. My parents pay.\n\n8PM - Once we get home, I log back on and start addressing comments the senior sent back over. S. tidies the house and finishes some work. I finally get the report out and we reconvene to watch Master Chef, and go to bed early. \n\n**Daily total: $0**\n\n**Day Six: Saturday**\n\n8:30AM - I’m going to look at a car this morning and I don\'t want to go alone, so my dad picks me and S. up to head to the dealership. We stop for coffee and pastries on the way, and my dad pays. I pay for his parking though, since he doesn\'t have the app. **$0.50**\n\n10AM - I liked the car, but the dealership wasn’t willing to negotiate on price at all, so I pass. I’ve been shopping for cars on and off for a while now. Mine is technically running, but she’s a high-maintenance gas guzzler and I’ve put so much money into repairs in the last year. I’m looking for something more reliable with cheaper upkeep, and hybrid. \n\n11AM - I eat leftovers for an early lunch while we do the Spelling Bee. The forecasted rain is late, so S. and I go for a bike ride. We do a 13 mile loop and head home just as the rain starts, excellent timing.\n\n2PM - I decide we’re going to break tradition and do our weekly grocery shop today instead of Sunday. We take turns cooking dinner, so this is next week’s menu: \n\n* Spaghetti, turkey meatballs, and arugula salad (S.)\n* Maple Brussel sprouts, baked chicken drumsticks, and wild rice (me, the wild rice was not good)\n* Crispy chicken thighs, beets, potatoes, and red-wine poached pears (S.) \n* Pork and veggie stir fry with noodles (me)\n* Miso salmon, garlic green beans, and couscous (S.)\n* Bulgolgi beef bowls with kimchi, cucumbers, and edamame (me)\n\nI get a salad kit, chicken tenders, and ravioli for work lunches, and we also buy fruit, pantry staples like chicken broth and onions, some quick frozen meals, and assorted snacks. **$75.81** (for my half)\n\n3PM - At home, we eat tinned sardines on crackers for a snack, and what\'s left of this morning\'s blueberry scone. It’s a weird food day. I meant to get some reading in (recently started *Katabasis*), but I end up lounging around on the couch while S. vacuums and tidies the house. He does another mini grocery run at a local store for his specialty yogurt and some other things. **$18.12** (my half)\n\n6PM - I’m not going to lie — I’ve been on the couch and on my phone all afternoon, alternating between shopping for handbags and looking up flights for a potential Europe trip next spring. S. makes pasta and meatballs (we forgot to get spaghetti!) with salad, and we eat while watching more Master Chef. He leaves for his tennis match, and I remain on the couch.\n\n8PM - Okay, time to get up. I clean the kitchen and start my Dutch homework. I’m enrolled in a Dutch language class that meets every weekend. Ideally, we’re supposed to practice at least half an hour per night, but I’ve been falling behind. I snack on maple kettle corn (Trader Joe\'s seasonal item, it\'s dangerously addicting).\n\n10PM - S. texts that he\'ll be home late from tennis, so I do my skincare and get into bed. I notice that he tidied my nightstand and untangled the necklace that\'s been there for a week.\n\n**Daily total: $94.43**\n\n**Day Seven: Sunday**\n\n9:30AM - S. is on a call for work, so I make my own coffee and get on the call for my Dutch class.\n\n11:30AM - After class, I have tortellini and leftover soup for lunch. The weather is unexpectedly nice and S. wants to go to the farmers market. We end up buying a half dozen fresh mini doughnuts ($3.50), some bagels ($13.24), and potatoes ($5.18, all these are on the shared card). I also buy two bottles of cider for my upcoming birthday party ($24). **$34.96**\n\n2PM - S. and I decide to do one of our favorite lazy afternoon activities: open houses. This was one of our top date activities when we first got together. We drive to a nice neighborhood and pull up Redfin. The first house we see has weirdly low ceilings but an absolutely gorgeous backyard, complete with a deck and fire pit, for a paltry $1.5 million. The second house is a townhouse with dark wood baseboards that aren\'t really speaking to me.\n\n4PM - My friends pick me up to go grocery shopping. We\'re doing hotpot at my house tonight, so we need to get ingredients. At the first grocery store, we get pork belly, bok choy, bean curd, various types of tofu, mushrooms, quail eggs, hotpot soup base and dipping sauce, soju, and egg tarts for dessert ($63.87, I pay and we\'ll divvy it up). At the second store, we get beef, more mushrooms, fresh noodles, 2 pounds of assorted fishballs, and lychee beer ($59.33). I also get some groceries separately: instant Vietnamese coffee, frozen pho meatballs, and churro-flavored Turtle Chips ($26.95). **$26.95**\n\n7PM - Hotpot time! S. has the table set and ready by the time we get back. We eat almost everything and are absolutely stuffed. I divide the total by four and it’s so much more affordable than what we would’ve paid at a restaurant. **$30.80**\n\n9PM - After everyone leaves, S. and I debrief on the dinner conversation. We do a Spelling Bee and watch some Master Chef before bed.\n\n**Daily total: $92.71**\n\n**Section Six: THE BREAKDOWN**\n\nFood + Drink: $229.33\n\nFun / Entertainment: $125.29 (birthday cake is counted here)\n\nHome + Health: $0\n\nClothes + Beauty: $56.05\n\nTransport: $0.50\n\nOther: $15.45\n\n**Total Spend: $426.62**\n\n**REFLECTION**\n\nI already track my expenses almost daily (I\'m more of a tracker than a budgeter) so I would say this week is atypical but not extraordinary in terms of spending. Obviously I\'m not buying a birthday cake every week, but there\'s always these $50-100 \"irregular\" expenses that pop up and the only thing that changes is the category it\'s in. I will say that since starting my new job a few months ago, I\'ve started to notice myself succumbing a little bit to lifestyle creep. To name a few things: I buy the fancy granola from our local grocery, I splurge on my Orangetheory membership (still mad about that fee), I cover for my friends here and there when we go out, and I started shopping at Everlane. And knowing that I\'ll likely be purchasing a new car soon, this is all something I\'ll need to keep an eye on.\n\nI also usually don\'t work this much - it fluctuates up and down, and that\'s just the reality of consulting.', 'gazpachoooo', 'MoneyDiariesACTIVE', 'https://reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1of0eom/im_26_years_old_make_120000_in_seattle_wa_and/', 61, 21, '2025-10-24 21:13:19', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Spain, Portugal, France (Paris)) since we knew there will be a lot more people during end of summer / start of fall plus ayaw ng sister ko ng matao lol)\n\nTop 5 Countries / Cities\n1. Copenhagen - very expensive but really worth the trip, whether nightlife or history is the reason you’re going to Denmark\n2. Tallinn - super cheap, relatively underrated, but worth the trip, surprised us the most among all countries\n3. Prague - great iconic spots, castles and bridges, good shopping if you want to shop for jewelry (my sisters and mom bought theirs from here, okay ang price and it looks really nice)\n4. Amsterdam - great historical buildings as well, great food, the only country where we ate Pinoy food since our hotel was literally beside the restaurant and lots of kabayans because of PDutz, memorable since this is where my parents studied and we revisited the places they went to \n5. Salzburg - Both for the Sound of Music and Mozart hubs, super super expensive ang sakit sa wallet but well preserved spots\n\nLeast favorite countries / cities\n1. Brussels - overrated, too expensive, everything’s in construction, quite dirty and full of graffiti; only silver lining is that it’s a good spot for day trips within Belgium and other countries outside Belgium (Luxembourg, Netherlands, Germany, France) if you’ll consider it\n2. Oswiecie - that Auschwitz experience was emotionally draining but grabe yung you’ll have to wake up by 3, be there by 5 outside in the cold with no benches, then go inside by 7, then wait for at least a few more hours especially if English guided tour, no shield from the sun, basically hulas ka lang the whole day, had lots of other tourists who basically dropped out in the middle of it upon experiencing the inconvenience of it all\n3. Vilnius - basically all you’ll go to is the Gediminas Hill complex and Old Town, other than that, nothing much to see, some sketchy areas outside the city proper\n4. Luxembourg - most of what you’ll need to see is already reachable within 20 mins from the bus, transport is free throughout but not much to see\n5. Riga - same reasons with Vilnius, although better food, more affordable, and better nightlife compared to Vilnius\n\nSaving tips\n1. It will largely depend on your itinerary. The more touristy it is, the more expensive it will be. The more inland it is, same analogy. The harder for them to get resources, same analogy. BeNeLux, Switzerland, Austria, France, and Scandinavia plus Finland are the more expensive ones. \n\nSo if you want it to be cheaper, you can opt for Poland, Czechia, the Baltics (if you’re really interested, I wanted to go there since prev USSR states), Germany and surprisingly, Strasbourg, compared to other French cities like Nice, Paris, etc.\n\nOr an alternative that we did is stay longer in the cheaper cities longer then stay shorter in the more expensive ones, and check if you can do day trips instead and if it’ll be cheaper and time efficient to just do a day travel instead, especially if you wouldn’t need more than a day in certain countries / cities since not much to see and do. \n\n2. If you can and allow yourself to be tortured just a bit, choose an overnight bus since it saves you a whole lot of money instead of a hotel. Overnight trains are basically night hotels by cost so it doesn’t save you a whole lot compared to buses. If you want to, you can opt for the Eurail pass, around 39k for us each for a month pass free with the included railways (which we used throughout). Check if your railways to and from each country are included in this so you can maximize its value. Basically, a ticket to each country will be around 2-3k one way, so if you use it at least 10-11 times, you’ll basically end up maximizing the value. Otherwise, just book it in the station or online. Book reserved seating when you can especially if you have a lot of luggage so you wouldn’t have to worry on running out of room in trains. \n\n3. If you really want to save some more money, bring canned goods, rice, or at least buy some grocery within each country if you’re going to stay at least 3-4 days since you can get breakfast, lunch or dinner cheaper this way. Most of our food expenses were for dinners since you’re already tired by then.\n\n4. Book AirBnB in the more expensive areas, book hotels in cheaper areas. Always include lifts in the options unless you want to carry 30kg luggages up 4 flights of stairs lol. Even harder if you’re the only guy since it’s likely the guys bringing everything up 🥲 Bring a good set of clothes for 7-10 days, then space it so you can just do laundry in your AirBnB in between trips since laundry is expensive in hotels. You also have the choice of buying clothes when you’re in EU but I’m a big guy so size is a bit difficult to ascertain for my case.\n\n5. No need to go HoHo / Uber / taxi in between locations in all countries, just use ChatGPT or Gemini in making an efficient itinerary from your hotel / train station to include all iconic spots within a set number of days you’re staying in that place. It makes locations walkable, or at the very least, you’ll know when you have to take a train / bus / tram to another spot. We walked a minimum of 12-14k steps per day all throughout the 2 months, so maximize your physical exertion since you can rest and take some painkillers / massage oils in the night before the next adventure on the next day. Context - I’m an obese guy, and most of us are either obese / overweight but we made it. If you survived the 20k steps per day in Japan or the 10k hikes in Taiwan, you’ll likely survive most of these unless you opt for the more hiking type itineraries (fjords in Norway, Swiss Alps, etc.). Bring Omega / Pau / Salonpas strips, and some painkillers if you really need it. \n\nYou can choose guided tours but it’ll add up to your expenses quickly, use this for locations that daytime tickets easily run out (I.e. Auschwitz, Wind mills in Netherlands, Interlaken and Grindelwald (since you’ll have to take a bus unless you drive there). Download both Uber and Bolt so you can compare prices for transport and minimize its use for going to and from the central station from your hotel and vice versa (since you’re carrying luggage, also consider if the cobblestones or the paths are smooth for your luggage), unless your place is extremely near the station. If you’re also a bit more spontaneous and you have some free time and would like to explore certain spots, you can just put your luggage in lockers in the train station then go explore for a city day tour, especially if you can cover most of a city by one day (I.e. Helsinki, Tallinn, Prague except if you include Wawel Castle, Krakow, Warsaw, Brussels, The Hague as examples).\n\n6. Bring snacks and water bottles, everywhere you go, without fail. As someone who is trained to not eat for prolonged periods and gorge once at rest, this is a great option. Instead of stopping at cafes or restaurants in between iconic spots, take a breather at a bench and eat some snacks / drink fluids to rehydrate and replenish. Carrefour, Spar, Narvesen, Circle K, Lidl, DM, 7-11, and the likes will be your best friend. They have some ready made food as well but not as good compared to Japan’s where you can live off of it. Water is potable in most locations so that’s one expense you’ll save on, especially if you’re staying in the capitals or more modern AirBnBs. If there’s one thing you can also maximize, opt for the breakfast in your hotel and eat a whole lot out of it so you’ll grow hungry later in the afternoon or night.\n\n7. Prioritize the castles, churches and museums to enter. Enter all museums, churches and castles that are free. If there is payment, prioritize those that you personally want to see (like if you’ll go to Versailles, for our case, it was Auschwitz, Wawel in Prague, Royal Castles in Stockholm, Norway, Denmark, Belfort in Bruges, Schonbrunn and Belvedere in Vienna, Salzburg in general because of Mozart and SoM, these are what I remember purchasing on the top of my head). Also check if they are open and what time they close so you can adjust your daily itinerary. General rule of thumb is that most are closed on Sundays, most close early on a Saturday, most close by 4 on weekdays. \n\nWas this tour absolutely hell? Yes, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Especially with the cancelled trains that had us remapping the whole day. Also from having to lift the bigger luggage of my sisters and mom. But it was damn worth every single peso and stress to experience EU.\n\nNext EU trip will be based in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, other Yugoslavia states and USSR states in the East.\n\nThank you and hope I can help out some of you guys interested in going to EU.

(16, 'reddit', '1ohz00o', 'ADVICE SOUGHT: 5-MONTH-OLD-DOVE WILL NOT EAT SEEDS', 'Hello everyone, I just joined Reddit to join this subreddit. Meet Beedy and Buddy, Oriental Turtle Doves!\n\n \n\nTheir parents built a nest right in front of my outdoor AC unit on the balcony, so I had to scoot the nest a bit before I turned on my AC for the first time this summer (June 1st). I thought they were brooding on the eggs, but while I moved the next I realized they had chicks already hatched.🥲 I had to turn on my AC for my sanity, so I still had to move the nest.... Then you guessed right... the parents came back and looked at the squabs, and never sat on them again. I waited until it got dark but temperature fell late at night and I was afraid the squabs were going to die. So I had no choice but to bring them inside, and had hand-raised them since.\n\n \n\nBeedy flew off on July 18th successfully 🥰 But Buddy is not able to leave due to medical reasons. His legs/toes are curled inwards so he\'s stepping on himself when he walks, and has a tumor under his wing and can\'t fly. The first vet I took them to didn\'t want to sedate Buddy for x-rays, so just examined him visually only, and said it was spayed legs. But no commercial doctor here in this country (I\'m currently in South Korea) is familiar with wild birds like Buddy so I started looking into it more and thought it was curled toe paralysis. Regardless, I saw online that some chicken farmer had made a toe brace with thin wire and taping it to chicks\' feet and corrected their curled toe paralysis, so I gave it a shot. The doctor didn\'t want to do it, said I had to do it at home. So I did and took Buddy back asking if the circulation looked OK, and the doc said it was perfect and I did a great job. Well, a little while later I was looking at his feet very closely and immediately noticed something was not right. So I unwrapped them and the toes were dead... So now Buddy is missing toes from both feet.\n\n \n\nI quickly lost confidence in that vet so I found a different avian vet in Seoul. He took x-rays without sedating him and it revealed Buddy had so many broken bones in his tiny body.. His shoulder was broken which explained why he couldn\'t fly, and his spine was broken, and then his leg bone was bent in L shape which is why his leg/feet were curling inwards. I felt terrible. I never stepped on him or anything, I just don\'t know how he sustained so many fracture. I noticed Beedy used to peck Buddy and step on top of him (I thought it was because she knew Buddy was weak) but I don\'t know if that could cause fracture. Also, when they were little, Buddy was way bigger and Beedy was the runt. But as Buddy\'s feet didn\'t cooperate, Beedy started attacking Buddy so I had to always supervise or keep them separated when I wasn\'t around.\n\n \n\nNow it\'s just Buddy and me since Beedy has flown off, and I have started taking Buddy to vet in Seoul every week for about a month. I like the fact that they don\'t sedate him to take x-rays and stuff, but every time he comes back, he\'s stressed out and doesn\'t eat for like three days. I weigh him every day, before the doctor he weighed 217 grams and at one point he fell down to 196 grams. I freaked out and started feeding him formula again.\n\n \n\nBut here\'s the problem: Even when he weighed 217 grams, he only ate sesame and perilla seeds.... He does not eat any other seed. I am uploading the picture of seeds I am giving him here, lined them up from smallest to biggest in size. The only two things that are missing from the picture are the regular white rice and Safflower seeds. Safflower seeds seem too big, he can\'t put swallow. I am so flabbergasted as I thought that was like dove-favorite? Anyway, he sustained himself on sesame and perilla seeds only before and now he doesn\'t even want to eat those. My question is, how can I get him to eat all the seeds I am giving him? I am giving  him fresh seeds, recently bought and stored in grain containers or zip-lock bags.\n\n \n\nI have in the picture (from smallest to largest): Italian millet (Seteria italica), Proso millet (I think #2 and #3 are both this), Perilla seed, Sesame seed, Flax seed, Yellow millet, Red millet, Black millet, Canary seed, Red rice, black/yellow/regular(?) rentils, Buckwheat, Barley pearl, Wheat, Rolled oats, Safflower seeds and White rice (not in the pic)\n\n \n\nI made foraging boxes for both Beedy and Buddy - they have a bit of sand and the red grits at the bottom, then the grains, and tree barks, pebbles, and then edible flowers and leaves for small animals. Both of them love foraging. Buddy will pick up the grains and shake it in his mouth a few times and then spit them out instead of swallowing. I wanted to add this video too but I guess I can\'t add both pics and videos at the same time so I\'ll upload it separately.  He keeps going back to the foraging box and does this, so I know he\'s hungry. He\'s drinking water well.\n\n \n\nHe\'s currently on two meds. Anti-inflammatory and pain med, and stomach ulcer meds. The doctor said he saw stomach lining in Buddy\'s fecal test and said Buddy had stomach ulcer. The doc also gave Buddy supplements (vitamins). Then for his tumor, I am putting this disinfecting solution from the vet three times a day. The vet said this tumor is from a broken bone which broke through his skin (The first vet said the tumor was from me not removing his pinfeather under his wing). Luckily, his tumor is getting smaller with treatment but he\'s not eating.\n\n \n\nHow can I get him to eat all the grains of different sizes? Any and all advice you provide will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much, have a great day!

(18, 'reddit', '1ofkmj8', 'How we conquered Japan in the Summer with 5 kids!', 'Prior to our Japan trip I found this subreddit to be extremely informational and I wanted to help contribute to the knowledge. I am married in my early 40s with 5 children ages 18, 16, 12, 9, and 6. We had planned to go to Japan in 2020 but then the pandemic  occurred and life got in the way so we finally decided to make the plunge as our eldest son was graduating high school and this could be our last big family trip with him. Our family is pretty easy going and we have independently traveled to Turkey and Scotland and Belize as a family with our own planning for everything. In preparation for the trip I used [booking.com](http://booking.com) for all our rentals and hotels and I reserved a car through toyota rent-a-car for our time between tokyo and kyoto.\n\n\n\nOur simplified itinerary was Tokyo for 3 nights, the 4th day we would pick up rental and drive to matsumoto for one night, 1 night in mountain guesthouse between matsumoto and Takayama , 2 nights in Takayama, 3 nights in Kanazawa, one night in Gifu prefecture (to go to Seki City), then 3 nights in Kyoto with us taking the shinkansen back to Tokyo for our flight back.\n\n\n\nThe only time we could realistically go was in June and July due to scheduling and I know that is not peak tourist season but we found that there were many benefits to it especially as we got out of the main city centers.  Japan has many good advancements to help deal with the sun such as UV umbrellas and clothing such as the Uniqlo apparel  and affordable sunscreen. We didn\'t use them but we saw many locals utilizing those u shaped neck coolers that you fill with water and freeze and of course there are electronic hand fans. That and there are always plenty of convenience stores and vending machines to sell cool drinks; of note some of the vending machines sell hot drinks (pay attention to color surrounding the indicated price on the machine) as well so when you think you might be buying an iced coffee and out comes a hot coffee and your wife is left sadly standing with a piping hot coffee on a 97 degree day.\n\n\n\nWas the heat intense?  Yes. Was it life ending and completely ruining of a trip?  No.  We had a vehicle with AC and we just planned activities that didn’t require extensive outdoor time while in the big cities.  That and it was an excuse to try more and different drinks and green teas!  I love how in America we have a wall of energy drinks while in Japan you have an entire wall of unsweetened teas from which to choose from.Once we were in the mountains of the Japanese Alps it was considerably cooler and approachable.\n\n\n\nDealing with misconceptions we had about Japan we were told that there was little soap and water or drying in the bathrooms but we did not find this to be the case at all. Pretty much 95% of every bathroom we used had the ability to wash your hands with soap and there was some form of drying either through air dryer or paper towel so no need to bring any sort of hand towel or anything with you; plus you are going to run into tons of souvenir shops that sell cool little handkerchiefs or towels that you will want to purchase anyways. I got a little one of Sumo Wrestlers doing yoga. \n\n\n\nSecondly, there really are no garbage cans for the most part but convenient stores for the most place will have them so we would tend to eat there (make sure you tell attendant you are eating there the tax is slightly higher for purchases made) and throw stuff out there and certain bathrooms will have them as well but we did end up carrying around some plastic baggies for inevitable trash that would accumulate and then would get in the habit of leaving them at hotel trash areas where we stayed or in the houses we rented.\n\n\n\nLastly, there seems to be a pervasive idea that taxis are quite expensive.  Relative cost compared to buses and trains yes but they were still much cheaper than any taxi you have taken in Chicago or New York. We found that most average taxi trips to get somewhere 15 minutes away was around $10 if that gives you an idea. Uber worked just fine using the taxi component. Uber eats also is very affordable and works just fine in Japan as well.\n\n\n\n**Travel Tips** \n\nBring a coin purse.  You will be using yen coins a lot. Or have something to organize your coins.\n\n\n\nAnother thing we did was bring a number of small gifts that we could have on hand to thank either our lodgers or any pleasant interactions we had. Since we are from Michigan we brought dried Traverse City Cherries and some gift bags and let me tell you they were a huge hit and all we gave them to were very appreciative and would usually return a small gift in return (as is very customary in Japan). It was so nice to bring  a small amount of joy to others and I think it helped make up for the fact that we were a large group of noisy Americans!\n\n\n\nAnother cultural tip that is appreciated in Japan is to buy a round of drinks for the wait and kitchen staff. This was always a big hit and usually wasn\'t more than 20$ USD\n\n\n\nSome of the most pleasant surprises for me in Japan was just how sensible things are. It was very easy to download the suica app and load it through Apple pay to pay for public transportation and vending purchases. We had to deal with 6 suica cards because of all the kids but otherwise it was pretty straightforward.  Parking in Japan was very easy even in big cities and was usually quite affordable. In japan most parking lots or structures either take a photo of your license which you enter at the kiosk to pay for the allotted time or whichever spot you park in senses your car and raises a little barrier.  To leave you enter your spot number, pay for the allotted time, then drive off within 3 minutes.  Super easy.  \n\n\n\n**Renting a car** was extremely easy as we rented a car through Toyota Rent-A-Car and it was a seamless process.  The vehicles come all set up with a credit card that records highway tolls and you will pay for at the end of the trip. I do suggest that everyone get the full insurance coverage otherwise you can pay some hefty fines for damage come the end of the trip and most insurance does not cover rental car damage in Japan. If you do have damage to your rental car even if it is a scrape that was your own fault you are supposed to call the police and file a police report exactly where it happened. We ran into this problem when I accidentally scraped the side of our Toyota Noah on a small cement wall and did not realize that we had to file a police report at the location where it occurred so when I went to turn it in I had to explain that I’m a dumb American and that is not how it works in America. It worked out okay but it was a little bit anxious as they tried to figure out how to handle the situation. \n\n\n\nOne interesting thing regarding cars in Japan is I couldn’t figure out why everyone seemed to be driving a brand-new car. My brother-in-law explained that the registration fees for new cars are very affordable and the older cars get the more exponentially those fees increase. This was deliberate on the part of the Japanese government to encourage people to purchase newer vehicles and the price of an average new car in Japan is $15-$30,000.\n\n\n\nDriving throughout Japan was very easy and their main highways are well laid out and signage tends to be both in Japanese and English.  Google maps worked great and our vehicle had Carplay which was excellent.  We felt that having a vehicle really allowed us to plan our own schedule and have the freedom to stop at random locations and stores and restaurants.  Some of our favorite meals were based on just pulling over and trying out a good looking restaurant we found on google maps. \n\nThat being said, in rural towns and even within kyoto and tokyo there can be some very narrow tight streets and passages and parking situations. Also, everyone in Japan backs into their parking spots so if you are not confident with your parking skills or driving with about 6 inches of clearance on either side,  renting a vehicle may not be for you.\n\n\n\nI thought I would list highlights that stood out from each city and locale we visit.  There is just simply to much to see and do and eat in Japan and we found ourselves just going with the flow and not worrying if we missed out on any “essential” Japan elements.  It’s vacation!! Sometimes restaurants are too crowded or venues are closed or whatever.  The exploration is what makes the adventure.\n\n\n\n**Tokyo**\\-We stayed in Asakusa which was quiet and wonderful and felt a bit more local.  There has been tons written on Toko so I will list some of the small highlights that we found in our short time there.  We did do Team Labs Planets with the kids which was fun but I wouldn’t say it is a must do.  \n\n\n\n[Gouter Le Blé](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gouter+Le+Bl%C3%A9/@35.7207105,139.7870177,16.75z/data=!3m1!5s0x60188e902ba947f9:0x35a21e336883a61d!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x60188be4ff39a9c9:0x2071625429c1ecbd!2sHANDS+Ginza!8m2!3d35.6743223!4d139.7654476!16s%2Fg%2F1v9tzx4w!3m5!1s0x60188e902a53187f:0x4681d6223c37bd42!8m2!3d35.7210016!4d139.7854625!16s%2Fg%2F1tfmhtqv?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)\\-Great French Bakery.

The outdoor onsen was white and sulferous and wonderful at night in the cool night air.  They have some cozy public areas and the kids set up the macbook to watch Spirited Away and after a day driving through the mountain tunnels it was the perfect movie to watch. \n\n\n\nWithin a short drive was a wonderful waterfall with river spanning bridges called [Bandokoro Falls](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bandokoro+Falls/@36.1179336,137.6034819,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d15c0124638c1:0x8bc08f5f079a195f!8m2!3d36.1279908!4d137.6578433!16s%2Fg%2F1hc0hdsd7?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which was simply magical but the real treat was doing the hike to [Sanbondaki Falls](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sanbondaki+Falls+Parking+Lot/@36.1179336,137.6034819,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d377a99377f8f:0x1f513d606c864bfc!8m2!3d36.1136631!4d137.5966738!16s%2Fg%2F11g6_db_fh?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). You park at what appears to be an abandoned ski hill and the trail is to the right of the lodge.  It is a 20 min walk to the falls and you will find a simply magical spot where three different rivers converge into one.  We spent the whole afternoon exploring and reading and enjoying the cool mist from the falls. There were lots of signs warning of bears and murder hornets but there were multiple bells along the trail to ring. Japan’s [bear population](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/JAPAN-BEARS/dwpkkldkapm/) has reportedly tripled in the past decade.\n\n\n\n**Takayama** After our time enjoying the mountain streams we went on to stay at the [Wat Hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wat+Hotel+%26+Spa+Hida+Takayama/@36.1371226,137.250411,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!3m8!1s0x6002bbefcc3119b9:0x81199aca7b1af0ed!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d36.1371183!4d137.2529859!16s%2Fg%2F11f5q8fzbs?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Takayama. This was very affordable and there are two large public onsens (mens and womens) with saunas as well as 4 private onsens that are first come. There are even little popsicles after you onsen that are free.  There is also a small parlor with an “all you can drink” package for 2000 yen but I ended up just buying sake cups from the vending machine. \n\n\n\nIn Takayama the highlights were the morning market for treats and souvenirs but the real hit with us all was the [Takayama Shōwa-kan Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Takayama+Sh%C5%8Dwa-kan+Museum/@36.1430879,137.2595787,16.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002bad09cac0001:0x3e465398237cce40!8m2!3d36.1439748!4d137.2599215!16s%2Fg%2F1vvyx_dx?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). This is a wonderful little museum showing the transition of post war Japan to modern day. It is full of kitch and in a sense is just a large antique store but we had so fun exploring the displays, trying out cassette Karoake, sitting in the little theater watching classic Japanese movie clips, and having the kids play in the model Japanese school room.  The candy and kitsch for sale in the gift store is wonderful and we filled up an entire bag of Japanese candy to bring home. \n\n\n\n[Kiyo Musubi Riceball](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyo+Musubi+Riceball/@36.140836,137.2604215,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002bbcd7344c827:0xd5b3d90bea75a81f!8m2!3d36.1416351!4d137.2613263!16s%2Fg%2F11g4d7hnrg?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) Amazing rice ball walk in shop run by a sweet elderly lady.  Once she sells out she sells out!  We bought here out for the day with our large group!\n\n\n\n[PIZZERIA HIRANOGRANO](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PIZZERIA+HIRANOGRANO/@36.134897,137.2375486,15z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1swood+fired+pizza!3m6!1s0x6002bade44ba2d19:0x39421b3c10da1029!8m2!3d36.134897!4d137.256603!15sChB3b29kIGZpcmVkIHBpenphWhIiEHdvb2QgZmlyZWQgcGl6emGSARJpdGFsaWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmFkM1pmZG5wQlJSQUKqAVgKCC9tLzA2NjN2EAEqFCIQd29vZCBmaXJlZCBwaXp6YSgAMh4QASIaA7URg4o__eOhA7qgkg2w7QFUCwULFZRdWlEyFBACIhB3b29kIGZpcmVkIHBpenph4AEA-gEECBUQKQ!16s%2Fg%2F1v6p4674?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) Very Authentic wood fired pizza shop with seating for 8-10 run by one man.

While still informational and enjoyable I wouldn’t spend more than 2 hours there.\n\n\n\n[Daio Wasabi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E5%A4%A7%E7%8E%8B%E3%82%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%B3%E8%BE%B2%E5%A0%B4/@36.3930183,137.6978388,11.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d6da35d71bd7d:0xd8adcf7ab2065700!8m2!3d36.3392598!4d137.9084423!16zL20vMGNndmNj?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) An active wasabi farm with several food options and a gift store.  This place was so cool!  It is free to walk around the grounds and\n\n\n\nAfter spending hot days in Takayama the kids wanted to cool down so I found another local waterfall on google maps and it was a huge hit.

I was hoping for a glass float but had no luck.  But we did find about 18 rubber boots!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe next drove to Gifu as I wished to visit Seki City and we stopped at the [Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fukui+Prefectural+Dinosaur+Museum/@35.977586,135.3216319,8.38z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff89af3546bd879:0x55d1ff4a7646b4e1!8m2!3d36.0824428!4d136.5065904!16s%2Fm%2F04f4ltr?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which we all quite enjoyed.  They had these wonderful little notebooks with gold embossed lettering in the giftshop that I picked up and their cafeteria was all dinosaur themed meals which was cute.  Worth a stop if it\'s on your way.\n\n\n\nIn Seki city the plan was to visit the multiple knife shops and blacksmiths in the region but sadly we visited on a Saturday and most of the stores were closed!  I did go to [Blacksmith Japan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blacksmith+Japan+%E5%8C%85%E4%B8%81%E3%81%A8%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%88%80%E8%B2%A9%E5%A3%B2/@35.4818549,136.9165544,19z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x6003043dea7ba5df:0xb88094cdce501761!2sSeki+Swordsmith+Museum!8m2!3d35.4818101!4d136.9164444!16s%2Fg%2F121gzx98!3m5!1s0x600305c55075ea23:0xf21a82916e05bfe1!8m2!3d35.4814608!4d136.9160635!16s%2Fg%2F11y6pf_5bk?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which was open with a very helpful salesmen that helped me find a locally forged kitchen knife that has been my favorite go to knife since we have been home.  We did find some good deals at the [Gifu Cutlery Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gifu+Cutlery+Hall/@35.4821893,136.9055503,16z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sknife+shop!3m6!1s0x60030417d1e1a1f3:0x4bd9d1ddb55df1aa!8m2!3d35.4821893!4d136.9150775!15sCgprbmlmZSBzaG9wWgwiCmtuaWZlIHNob3CSAQ1jdXRsZXJ5X3N0b3JlmgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJVY1ZCVFQybDNSUkFCqgFNCggvbS8wNGN0eBABKg4iCmtuaWZlIHNob3AoADIfEAEiG_D_t-bQZAEDeWP2Kf8VeCT6YHbLbNynInNdKjIOEAIiCmtuaWZlIHNob3DgAQD6AQQIABBD!16s%2Fg%2F1238mcjj?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which luckily had a lot of the knives from the local producers although I suspect I may have paid a bit more but it was the only shop really open. That being siad they had a great selection for every budget as well as gardening tools, scissors, and other small metal implements.\n\n\n\nAnother stop in Seki city was the [Feather Razor Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Feather+Razor+Museum/@35.4829306,136.9195152,16.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x600304164a7dc103:0x1633e051b2744b80!8m2!3d35.4835472!4d136.9150861!16s%2Fg%2F122pl6t5?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). My brother in law introduced my to wet shaving about a decade ago and his favorite razor blades are feathers so we had to visit since we were in the area!  It is a free museum outlining the history and achievements of the Feather company and was a wonderful hour long visit. \n\n\n\nWe ended our trip with several nights in Kyoto staying at the [Hotel Imagine Kyoto](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HOTEL+IMAGINE+KYOTO/@34.981715,135.7581944,17z/data=!4m11!3m10!1s0x600108ad23243af9:0xb545f0a07b37ac39!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.9817106!4d135.7607693!16s%2Fg%2F11gxsf_48f?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and really enjoyed Kyoto although I would have liked to have had a couple more days to explore the surrounding area. We did get the chance to go to the [Osaka Aquarium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Osaka+Aquarium+Kaiyukan/@34.6545225,135.4240936,16z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6000e8f48fa243ff:0x25fc1f29292f7889!4m11!3m10!1s0x6000e8f48c0da9cd:0x6f83c520ae082ccc!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.6545182!4d135.4289645!16zL20vMDJjeW13?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which I wanted to visit solely to see the whalesharks.  They have two of them! The aquarium itself was a 7/10 I would say and be forewarned that entrances are timed so prepurchasing your tickets is advisable.  We got their late for the 11am entrance but there is a nice little mall right next door we spent time shopping at while we waited.  We also had the chance to see the Orix Buffaloes at the [Kyocera Dome](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kyocera+Dome+%C5%8Csaka/@34.6692848,135.4735678,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6000e7b18b4362e7:0xf49415dccf44dbc0!4m11!3m10!1s0x6000e7b24b87684b:0x535f75f9161484f1!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.6692804!4d135.4761427!16s%2Fg%2F12xqz5chj?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and it was one of our favorite experiences during our trip!  It is a bit confusing how seating works but once we found our seats it was a blas seeing all the different chants and songs from the fan sections for both fans and then trying all the awesome snacks and drinks which were much more affordable than any MLB game!  Within the whole stadium there are women with mini kegs on their backs that you can flag down for a fresh draft beer which was a blast.  The kids were less enthused than wife and I but everyone had a good time. Also, the merch for teams and players is hilarious and worth checking out after the game.\n\n\n\nWe had been promising the 6 year old all trip to go to a train museum since we had skipped one in Tokyo so we went to the [Kyoto Railway Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kyoto+Railway+Museum/@34.987103,135.7396983,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m11!3m10!1s0x6001061746adc243:0x899ffa889ace79ed!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.9870986!4d135.7422732!16s%2Fm%2F07kc9qj?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which was wonderful experience outside of the fast that everything was in Japanese!  We only had one iphone for google translate which frustrated things but overall it was a great museum.  They have huge roundhouse outside with a vintage steam locomotive that I believe you can book rides one.\n\n\n\nWe ended our last full day in Japan visiting the [GEAR](https://www.google.com/maps/place/GEAR+%2FNon-Verbal+theatre/@35.0085287,135.7639592,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60010892296a9855:0x442d026d94b8cd2e!4m11!3m10!1s0x60010892296800d1:0x833920b059ebecf!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d35.0085243!4d135.7665341!16s%2Fg%2F1230_6tg?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) non verbal theater to watch their production. It is a “non-verbal” theater in that the story is laid out through an amazing show of lights, theatrics, an interactive stage and 5 talented actors. I actually don’t want to explain more than that because the show is totally worth it going in blind and I guarantee you will enjoy the 90 min performance.  Just be warned you may become part of the show as some part of the night!\n\n\n\nThe next day we finally had the chance to ride the Shinkansen back to Tokyo to catch our flight and it was everything everyone says.  Just be sure that if you have luggage you purchase the tickets that allow the “oversized” baggage etc. \n\n\n\nJapan is an amazing country and while we did not do all the traditional sights we tried to balance the trip between town and country while looking for our own unique adventures.  I fully plan on returning to Japan in the future and hope to visit the northern prefectures at some point in my life. Overall Japan is very easy to travel in, the food is amazing, the people are reserved but always helpful and respectful.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n', 'Snoo16433', 'JapanTravelTips', 'https://reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ofkmj8/how_we_conquered_japan_in_the_summer_with_5_kids/', 46, 17, '2025-10-25 12:37:30', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),
(19, 'reddit', '1oegy9r', 'We Ate Them.', 'This is a prequel to my story, They Ate Us. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the late 1700s, there was an economist named Thomas Robert Malthus. He predicted that humanity\'s population growth would doom it to a never ending cycle of poverty, famine, and misery. He theorized that there would come a time that the exponential growth of the human population would surpass the linear growth of food production, leading to a perpetual famine. \nHowever, humanity, intentionally or otherwise, always seemed to kick the can down the down, and stall this slow apocalypse. \n\nIn the mid 1800s, the industrial revolution began, and with it came new technologies and fertilizers that allowed for agricultural production like never before. Farms could produce more crops and livestock than previously considered possible, alleviating fears of Malthus\'s predicted future. \n\nIn the mid 1900s, humanity suffered its first two world wars. Though tragedies by almost all metrics, these wars spurred the ingenuity of farmers who had to meet the great food demands for the wars. After the wars were over, these agriculture innovations continued to increase food production. This combined with the dramatic death toll that decreased the population meant that humanity had once again saved itself from Malthus\'s predictions. \n\nHowever, in the late 2000s, the human population on earth had reached more than 10 billion. Though well within what was expected, what was not expected was the rice blight, a devastating disease that swept across the world, rendering rice, the most mass produce food product in the world, extinct, within a single decade. To make up for the loss of this staple crop, countries around the world began planting other grains, mainky wheat and maize, in the now barren rice fields. Tragically, in this rush to meet world food demand, the rice blight was allowed to cross-species from rice, to nearly every other grain species the world relied on. \n\nBy the early 2100s, domestic grain crops, which provided up 60% of the calories and protein in the average human\'s diet, were completely extinct. As if this were not destructive enough, the livestock humanity raised for their meat, goats, pigs, chickens, cows, and so many more, were fed mainly on grains, grains that no longer existed, leading to a massive decline in the available livestock population.\n\nNearly 400 years of stalling since Thomas Robert Malthus first predicted it, the perpetual famine had finally caught up to humanity, and the sudden nature of it all led to mass starvation world wide. \n\nIn order to counter this crisis, the remaining world powers pooled their resources in an effort to find a way to prolong their remaining avenues of sustenance. Fearing the blight could spread to any new staple crop, scientists turned their attention to the remaining livestock, and after years of debate and deliberation, an idea was struck. \n\nTo restore and preserve humanity\'s food supply, many predominantly herbivorous animals were modified on the genetic level with the goal of making their metabolism more efficient, such that they could survive off any plant material, and require less food per day to survive. In this way, humanity sought to increase the agricultural animal population, and for a time, it worked.\n\nFor the next several generations, the animal population increased, and with it, so too did humanity escape its famine. However, eventually humanity\'s attempt at playing God would get out of hand.\n\nAt the dawn of human kind, one of the key advances in their evolution was the fruit of their own labor. By learning to cook food, they could digest food easier, get more energy from it, and that excess energy helped develop their brains and intelligence beyond that of their primate cousins.\n\nSimilarly, now that the farm animals could more efficiently metabolize their food, and had a near limitless supply of food since they could eat any plants around them, their bodies had a surplus of energy that their brains could use.\n\nIt was slow at first, merely gradual changes in behavior, but at some point, some of the animals that were already clever to start with, like the pigs, seemed to start socializing more, communicating in more complex vocalizations than the basic grunts and oinks of their ancestors. \n\nIt did not take long for the rest to catch up, especially as the pigs helped teach the others, and soon the various species of fame animals were forming the basics of their own language. And with the ability to communicate, came understanding of their situation, the understanding that each and every one of them was born to be devoured by the furless, featherless, two legged creatures. \n\nAs humanity watched, they began to grow concerned. Of course there were moral concerns on the ethics of eating and farming arguably sentient species, especially ones that they had helped gift intelligence to, though indirectly. And yet, another great concern was that of revolution. The animals outnumbered humanity 10 to 1, and many, like the cows, were physical stronger than any human. Wipe the animals out before they could become smart enough to rise up, and humanity would be both plagued with guilt, and out of food. \n\nFearing that any situation involving cohabitation would lead to a \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" scenario, humanity enacted two simultaneous scientific ventures. First, the development of new synthetic foods, immune to the blight, but not animal based. Second, the prospect of leaving Earth before humanity or the animas tried to wipe each other out. \n\nThe first, a problem which had eluded humanity for generations, proved relatively simple once linked with the second problem. Once it was understood that humanity would need to produce its own food in space, experimentation into zero gravity agriculture went into full swing, and quickly made leaps and bounds. The result was a series of genetically modified algae, vines, and kelp, which didn\'t just survive in zero gravity, but grew to ridiculous proportion thanks to more direct access to solar rays, unburdened by a planet\'s atmosphere, yet shielded from the radiation. \n\nAs humanity made the transition from eating sentient animals to space grown plants, livestock farms were shut down and the animals released. With newfound freedom, some of the more dexterous animals, such as the chickens, started making and using basic tools. Though it started with simple sharpened sticks being used to draw out ants, it was obvious that the animals were developing at the far faster rate than humanity did. This stoked humanity\'s fears, yet also stroked their pride, perhaps some day they would return to Earth only to find a civilization surpassing their own. \n\nAs humanity built their great colony ships, they stripped the Earth of almost every man-made structure, reusing the pre processed materials, and preserving the historical monuments. Though merely out of sentimentality for their own history and practicality of cutting costs, the end result was an empty world, a blank slate left behind for the animals to build their own civilization on. \n\nIn the mid 3900s, humanity would face new challenges, and send a scout ship to their nigh forgotten home; and so the devoured would at last reunite with their former devourers. \n', 'DMofTheTomb', 'HFY', 'https://reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1oegy9r/we_ate_them/', 178, 4, '2025-10-24 04:18:19', '2025-11-07 23:40:40');

They usually do their daily streams at 11pm-2am at night after doing a full cast, and are on a much tighter schedule once they’re abroad.*\n\nHi, Cloudtemplar here. Reporting live from Shanghai. Today was a full-on monsoon of mixed feelings. I think a lot of tears were wept by people all throughout the scene, for various different reasons. For one, I still can’t help keeping my feelings in order despite it being close to midnight. I would bet the many HLE and Peanut fans around the world couldn’t help but keep themselves from shedding a tear as well. I would also think that some people cried you know, down there, because of the breathtakingly outstanding gameplay that was put on display today. I personally didn’t cry up there, but down there.\n\nSince I’m now here on-site at Shanghai, let me share a bit about what’s going on. We’re currently staying at the Marriott in Shanghai, and it’s pretty awesome. Very nice hotel, and a large one too. It’s above 60 stories tall, and I’m currently staying on the 40^(th)\\-something floor. The view of Shanghai is crazy from up here. A very luxurious, high value hotel. The GenG of hotels, if you will.\n\nFor a lot of us on the Korean cast, it’s not our first rodeo in China. We’ve all been to Chengdu, Shanghai and Beijing in the past. It’s always a good time. Personally, I stick to eating food that I know my stomach can handle whenever I do go abroad. Stuff that I know I like and have tried in the past. So when I’m in China, I tend to avoid the fancy, luxurious cuisine and just stick with stuff like fried rice and a pork dish as an entrée.\n\nSome of the viewers that have been to the LPL arenas will know that everything here is on a whole different scale. The arenas are huge, where the one in Shanghai seats close to 20,000. There really hasn’t been that many instances where international competitions have been hosted in this large of an arena all the way back in Quarterfinals, so I’m really looking forward to how the Finals in Chengdu is going to turn out. The LPL arenas really are quite nice. We had nearly a full house today, with the live atmosphere being very heated. The stage is right in the middle of the arena too, where the live experience being extremely immersive because of it.\n\n \n\nAs someone that’s been on-site for pretty much all the international events in League’s history, I do think it’s been a while since I’ve come out of a cast with this degree of mixed feelings. I still can’t help myself from thinking how sad it is that one of these teams had to go home today. The saying goes that everyone has their 5 seconds of fame, and that it’s important to seize the moment when the opportunity is presented to you. It just so happened that GenG and HLE’s most important 5 second time window decided to coincide with one another today, where one side inevitably had to walk out in defeat. I truly do think that GenG and HLE are both teams that had what it took to go even further this tournament, to where there’s a number of multiverses out there that do have both teams going much higher.\n\nI think that’s one of the biggest reasons why I’m so burnt out right now, since today’s series was one where those stars did collide with one another. It’s really rare for me to be burnt out this much even after the bangeriest of bangers. But I couldn’t help but cave to the sheer amount of intensity in-game, where I was already tired out by the end of Game 2. If anyone did miss the opportunity to watch today’s series live, I 100% recommend that you go back and watch today’s series in full. It truly was the best show of League of Legends we’ve had in a while. The best we’ve had this year – although that may be subject to change in the upcoming weeks.\n\nI really am at a loss to say in terms of analysis and draft-related talk. At least when it comes to everything that happened in Game 1 and 2, I genuinely don’t think there’s any point in me going over anything. That’s how much of an impression those first 2 games left for me. In that epic exchange of gameplay, it came down to spur-of-the-moment things that decided who got the upper hand. I kind of want to cherish, and sit on those moments a bit as they were.\n\nIt is true that today’s game really was incredibly epic, and very much deserving of a battle between the first and second place power ranking teams. But with that said, I don’t want to say things along the lines of “This was basically the Finals” and stuff. Today was today, and whatever happens from here on forwards is still undecided. It’s just that out of all the outcomes that could have happened today, one of the most awesome, awe-inspiring outcomes decided to come forth.\n\n \n\nGames 1 and 2 were truly just a battle of the gods. Simply awe-inspiring, where I really don’t have much to say. On that note, let’s start with Game 3.\n\nHLE (Blue, Game 3)\n\nBans : Qiyana, Galio, Blitzcrank / Braum, Lulu\n\nPicks : Rumble / Trundle, Rakan / Sivir / Yone\n\nGEN (Red, Game 3)\n\nBans : Yunara, Vi, Aurora / Xayah, Smolder\n\nPicks : Sion, Skarner / Viktor / Bard / Kaisa\n\nWhile this was something that was mentioned on the cast today, I would bet that the same thing was noted across all the different regional broadcasts and costreams as well. What I’m referring to is the decision GenG took for Red 1-2, and how they didn’t just go for the Sion-Trundle. It’s really kind of funny once you think about it, since the Sion-Trundle seems so obvious. But then you consider that it’s GenG, and maybe that’s just something GenG does just because they’re GenG.\n\nThe funny part is that GenG actually did take this Game 3 composition and played the game to a point where it seemed they were actually getting it to work. But my whole stance in regard to this is that while it is nice that you did get something out of the ordinary to work – I do think there should be a line you don’t cross in terms of putting yourself too behind, regardless of how confident you may be. So even if you are confident, and even capable of beating paper with rock, my question lies in the fact that whether or not you do have to commit to the rock when better alternatives against paper are clearly out there.\n\nGoing back to the Sion-Skarner for GenG’s Blue 1-2, consider the order in which this draft was conducted. In the context of rock-paper-scissors, GenG picking Sion-Skarner for Blue 1-2 was quite literally them playing rock first when they knew a paper from HLE was imminent. The option for them to go for scissors, or even paper were clearly there – yet they decide to go for rock anyways. I would have given them somewhat of a pass if it was a more nebulous situation where they didn’t know what HLE were going to play, but this Game 3 draft was one where it was quite obvious what HLE were going to play.\n\n \n\nIf I had to vote one single player for Player of the Series today, it would have to be Kiin. That’s why another reason why GenG playing rock into an upcoming paper from HLE ended up really throwing them off-balance was that their ‘rock’ involved them having Kiin’s Sion be neutered by HLE’s ‘paper’. Kiin did so much for the side of GenG today, but passing on the Sion-Trundle and giving the Trundle to HLE was the equivalent to removing all of Kiin’s arms and limbs. Not only does the Trundle for HLE give them a favorable jungle matchup into the Skarner, but it also gives them a game where Kiin is basically unable to play the game.\n\nThe Sion really is quite literally at a loss of things to do in-game against a Trundle. It’s one of the reasons why Trundle is the most hated champion by the Trundle-playing community. There’s of course the aspect of your tank identity being greatly diminished by the Trundle R in theory, but also the denial of any playmaking ability from the Sion R by the Trundle pillars. It’s just one of those matchups where you really do become useless in the presence of another champion.\n\nNot only that, but the composition of HLE’s was just one that Sion matches up poorly into. So because of all those reasons, GenG playing their ‘rock’ in Sion-Skarner during Blue 1-2 was them putting themselves in a position where they could not expect any output from Kiin. Especially during a series where Kiin had done so much for them earlier during Games 1 and 2.\n\nYou could try and do some over-the-top justification on how this was a big brain, cross-series setup from GenG to create a more favorable environment to pick Ksante in Game 4. Where Ksante also would rather not play against a Trundle, and GenG forces it out during Game 3 by baiting it out with the Sion-Skarner. But that’s going way too overboard. They should have just gone for the Sion-Trundle, pure and simple. While GenG going for the Sion-Trundle doesn’t exactly mean that they would have won Game 3, it definitely would have resulted in a game where things went much smoother for GenG.\n\nEspecially when the series was in a state where HLE didn’t get run over by GenG. It definitely wasn’t one where they got absolutely skill-diffed, where both Game 1 and 2 were decided by razor-thin margins. So in a Game 3 where HLE did get a clear upper hand in draft, it resulted in HLE being in a great position to fight back and swing.\n\n \n\nGEN (Blue, Game 4)\n\nBans : Caitlyn, Maokai, Vi / Rell, Renekton\n\nPicks : Yunara / Ksante, Alistar / Nidalee, Hwei\n\nHLE (Red, Game 4)\n\nBans : Qiyana, Galio, Braum / Ahri, LeeSin\n\nPicks : Aurora, Nocturne / Smolder / Leona / Camille\n\nFor Game 4, the main aspect of GenG’s composition was how, and to what degree the Nidalee was able to do her ‘thing’. On paper, I do think that HLE did end up with an overall composition that was much easier to execute. But GenG were able to play so well in-game where the stage was set near-perfectly for the Nidalee, where GenG ended up taking over.\n\nI don’t think the Game 4 draft was one where one composition was ‘stronger’, or had a stylistic advantage over the other. Just one where GenG’s depended a lot on the Nidalee, and one where HLE’s was much easier to execute in-game. It’s just that GenG’s in-game play never gave HLE an opening, where the masterclass from GenG’s laners just kind of all linked together to make the game very comfortable for GenG’s composition to play.\n\nKiin and Chovy especially had a lot in making this happen. The whole Kii’Sante angle seemingly never gets stale, especially when you see it pull through as massively as it did today. There’s always something that’s not quite right about Kiin’s Ksante, in all the good ways. There’s not only that, but Chovy’s Hwei as well. You really got to see the multi-purpose nature of Hwei shine in a game state where GenG just seemed to win, where they were also able to realize the poking synergy of Hwei and Nidalee later on.\n\nThe one thing HLE had to do was find openings and crack open GenG through the Camille, Nocturne and Aurora. But once the Ksante got accelerated early on, it seemed near impossible to find an opening through it. Once GenG got rolling with their players playing incredibly solid, the dive identity of HLE’s was never able to be realized. GenG just kept a steady pace throughout with objective fights, and HLE was seemingly unable to do anything about it.\n\nHLE did have the Smolder on their side, but GenG never gave it the chance to become the monster HLE wanted. Once GenG started getting leads, they kept pushing it. It was too difficult for HLE to even buy time for the Smolder, where they had already given up too much by the time Smolder could start doing his thing.\n\n \n\nEver since I retired, I’ve transitioned into being a toplaner-jungler hybrid. I’ve started to play more and more toplane as the years went by, to where I think my identity as a League player actually teeters more on the side of a toplaner. As a toplaner watching this series, the ever so intense tightrope between the two toplaners was so cool to watch. You saw both toplaners seemingly unwilling to back down when it came to the smallest of things, where both were trying to maximize the absolute most out of every given situation.\n\nAs a toplaner, you kind of see that happening in realtime and feel nothing but awe. You fully understand why both Kiin and Zeus are playing in that sort of way, since you know that they’re toplaners of the highest level. Even in situations where you think it’s right for one to back down – you see them not bat a single eye and be ready to take a stab at the other on a moment’s notice. While I do think that a more peaceful, or balanced-out resolution would have come forth in the toplane if either side was willing to take a backseat for even a second – I can totally understand why they played the way they did. Both Kiin and Zeus are indeed players on top of the food chain, with every right and justification in doing what they did. We saw that kind of dynamic in the Ambessa-Gwen, and the Ksante-Camille matchup. An incredibly tense standoff between the two, where Kiin ended up coming out with an advantage.\n\nMoments and matchups like these are such a pleasure to watch. Ones where the matchup becomes volatile solely because players from both sides are so incredibly good. One where Kiin coming out ahead and playing better doesn’t take away from the fact that Zeus also played very well.\n\nThat’s why I said during the broadcast that while there was a winner to the series and players that performed better than their counterparts, today’s game just isn’t one where you focus on the disappointments and shortfalls of the other. While one party was bound to walk away as the victors over the defeat of the other, today is not the day for criticizing the latter. All I want to do is admire, and give a well-deserved round of applause to both sides. In the result-focused culture we have in League and e-sports, I do realize that it might not be a popular takeaway. But I really do think today’s game was more than deserving of this kind of conclusion.\n\n \n\n**&lt; Conclusions, Q&amp;A &gt;**\n\nThere were just so many key moments to this series to count. There’s Viper, who really played his heart out today. Especially during that Ziggs game, where we were referring to Ziggs’s mana pool as the fuel tank to HLE’s engine. It was so heart-wrenching to see Ziggs’s mana bar diminish over time in a standoff, knowing that every bit of mana was Viper’s best efforts to try and keep his team in the game. Really goes to show why logistics and supply lines are so important during times of war.\n\nEven that Reksai moment at the end of Game 1 that got GenG the win. That situation only game to be because Canyon teleported over with the hexgate and set off the blast cone. Pony said this during the broadcast, but even the smallest things can determine the outcome between two grandmasters. In a duel between the two best swordsmen in the world, a drop of water falling from a tree can make the difference between life and death. Just one split second of you looking away can give your opponent the opening he needs.\n\n \n\n“How’s the Mordekaiser into Ksante?”\n\nIf you want to make him work, you definitely can. Ok. So in terms of draft and what either side could have done differently today – I really have nothing to say. The only noteworthy point I have is Game 3, but only because that was an instance of willingly playing rock into an incoming paper. Aside from that, I really do think there’s not too much to say in regard to draft.\n\nEven when it comes to the Sion-Skarner. Pony and I had a somewhat long discussion during the break after Game 3 about why GenG didn’t go for Sion-Trundle instead. But the conclusion is that we’ll never be able to know as third parties. There’s no instance where GenG didn’t see the Trundle coming. They probably did pick the Sion-Skarner knowing that the Trundle was going to come their way. It’s just that we’ll never know the reasoning and thought process behind why they may have thought that was playable.\n\n“They probably gave away the Sivir to HLE the same way they did for the Trundle.”\n\nGood point. So if you go back to each stage of that draft, GenG could have just took the Sivir for themselves much earlier. That’s definitely something else that they did have the opportunity to do, and something that would have made Game 3 a lot easier for them. It’s just that we don’t know the exact reasoning behind why they willingly pushed Sivir prio down the same way they picked Sion-Skarner. It just goes to show how the game became very difficult for the side of GenG in-game once they started losing control.\n\n \n\nThere’s some takeaways from Viper’s performance today. Viper has always been the insurance factor for HLE this entire year, where he was the man responsible for ensuring a certain minimum level to HLE’s gameplay throughout their ups and downs. We most definitely also saw that in play today.\n\nThe takeaway from this is how important it is for a team to have that type of player that defines how high your team’s floor is. That’s because when you’re going about theorycrafting and planning for whatever game you may have ahead, the focal point of gauging your performance is the average minimum level of output that your team is capable of. If you are a team that has a consistent minimum of play, planning out elements of strategy and expectations becomes so much more effective. When you aren’t, that’s when every game you play is pretty much equivalent to you just rolling dice.\n\nThat’s why GenG is so broken in terms of their minimum floor, and how their floors are higher than the ceilings of most teams. Their biggest strength is in Kiin and Chovy – specifically in how they’re always able to guarantee such a high, consistent level of play. It’s like having a pair of twins not only secure the top of the class in the two different districts throughout their entire academic career, but also do it while only getting at most 1-2 questions wrong on every question and exam. As outrageous and nonsensical as that sounds, that’s how crazy of a team GenG is.\n\n \n\n“What do you think the basis behind the Nidalee was?”\n\nWe commonly refer to Nidalee belonging to the archetype of champions we call ‘composition-breakers’. So in Game 4, it wasn’t a question of how ‘well’ the Nidalee fit into GenG’s composition. It was more of how well the GenG laners could do in securing laning leads, and how well the Nidalee could do her thing off those leads. In today’s Game 4 draft environment where a lot of viable jungle picks were eliminated, that was very much something that GenG could have gone for.\n\nThat’s what GenG ended up doing, where they trusted in their laners to do their job and Canyon to do his thing on Nidalee. That’s exactly what GenG did, where the Nidalee was also able to perform in a composition matchup where she could thrive once her team was ahead. The Nidalee is just a pick that can prove to be very effective the higher weight class your team belongs in – to which GenG most definitely is. Aside from Canyon being good on the Nidalee, that’s a big reason why the Nidalee works for GenG.\n\n \n\n“What do you think is the better side of the Azir-Orianna handshake?”\n\nI think it’s just up to the preferences of the parties involved.\n\n“Thoughts on the Hwei?”\n\nHwei is another champion that belongs in the lineage of Viktor-esque champions, just like the Mell. Getting her to work is very difficult, but you did see her work out when a player like Chovy just plays Hwei to the limits of her design.\n\nOne thing that I do want to remind people of in regard to matchups is that League is not a game where the rock-paper-scissors matchup is not as strongly defined. That’s just how League is by design. So even in times where we do say the term ‘hard counter’, the implications of one side being absolutely superior to the other is not as strong compared to other titles.\n\nThat’s why we almost never refer to matchups on the professional level in a way rock will always beat scissors. It’s always a very delicate matter of who has a slight advantage over the other, vice versa. This also ties in directly with how there’s a ‘pilot factor’ to League, where the skill of the player does in fact have the potential to have massive influence over how the matchup goes. Whether that be skewing the matchup ever so slightly in his favor or absolutely turning the dynamics of a matchup in the opposite direction.\n\nThis is why the casters always emphasize how the perception of certain matchups should never be based off of “A is better than B” one-liners. While that may be partially true, always be wary of the fact that there’s numerous elements of unexplained detail that simply isn’t mentioned in that one sentence. Yes – while it is frustrating to not have a clear answer in regard to matchups and in-game dynamics, that’s just how the game of League is.\n\nApply this to Ksante and Kiin. There’s so much detail when it comes to in-game play and things like ‘pilot factor’ that’s at play, to which a short statement like “Ksante is broken” cannot cover. So always take note of the fact that no game and draft is alike, and that so many things can turn the tides of statements like “A is better than B” and “A is broken.”\n\n \n\n“What are some AD midlaners that can be picked right now?”\n\nWe’re seeing the Yone right now, so there’s that. I think things like the Smolder and Tristana can also appear when the time is right. There’s also some extreme cases that could be considered in very fringe cases. Things like Yasuo, Jayce and Sett. It’s all a matter of how much you’re willing to commit to a certain identity later on in Fearless draft, and how willing you are in letting the identity of your comp be determined by those champions.\n\n \n\n“What if HLE picked the Ornn instead of Camille in Game 4?”\n\nOrnn in the place of Camille would have made Game 4 an entirely different game. So there’s really no way of telling what might have happened, since that’s an entirely separate what-if situation. But it’s not like the Ornn ‘wins’ against the Ksante, right? The Ksante always has kill angle priority for the entire game over tanks like the Ornn. So there’s really no way of telling how a potential Game 4 with Ornn may have turned out. That’s why I never really entertain the what-if scenarios of “What if A team played X instead of Y?”\n\nBesides, the Game 4 draft was one where I think both sides had a say in what they wanted to do. It was just that once the actual game started, GenG was able to make very good use of snowballing their laning leads. As I mentioned earlier, Kiin and Chovy played near-perfectly in that process – which also set up the Nidalee very nicely. All these individual factors culminated into a comprehensive lead for GenG, where the engage identity of HLE’s wasn’t able to find an opening. GenG kept up their lead and closed out HLE bit by bit, to which HLE had lost too much ground by the time Smolder had finally reached his threshold.\n\n \n\n“What champion do you most want to see this tournament?”\n\nAnything goes, really. I would think that all teams have different priorities in that regard, to where teams can, and probably will pull out a lot of interesting things in the later parts of Fearless draft. That’s the main point of Fearless, where you’re forced into picking the next-best response and less-worse options the further in you go. The reasoning behind why a certain pick is played and why a certain pick isn’t is entirely up for the teams to decide.\n\n \n\nTo summarize, I would like to give a big thanks to both GenG and HLE for giving us today’s series. One that was breathtaking and sensational in all the good ways. It was a spectacle for me to watch as both a commentator and an individual viewer. There was just so much to admire and enjoy, and I’m so glad I was there to witness it. The best wishes to Peanut, and a round of applause for his last dance. The most important thing about going to the military is coming out safe and sound – he has all our blessings.\n\nFor GenG, I genuinely think that they have never been in a better position to write history. Not only is winning Worlds this year so very important for so many of their players, but they’ve now just beaten their biggest perceived tournament rivals of HLE. From their dominant performance all throughout the year to beating HLE today – it’s now a matter of whether or not they can keep it up just a bit more until the very end.\n\nI do think the possibility of CFO advancing over KT is there. I do think they have what it takes. But in the chance they do, I don’t think they’ll be able to beat GenG. I’m sure of it. If any one of the two were to take GenG down in the Semifinals, I think KT would have a better chance of capitalizing on whatever opening GenG might have. While I have been a big fan of CFO and their run this far, I don’t think they can do it against GenG.\n\n“Didn’t you say that last year about FLY?”\n\nTrue. But while I do think FLY were able to contest GenG In that series, the notion of them being competitive and beating GenG outright are two entirely different things. It’s just that the Bo5 environment makes the possibility of an upset very, very slim. Especially when it’s a matchup between two teams where one is clearly of a lower weight class than the other.\n\n \n\n“Is Showmaker going to make a surprise appearance on the cast soon?”\n\nI was told that Showmaker and some of the people from DK were coming over to Shanghai. I haven’t seen or heard from him on-site though, so we’ll have to see.\n\n \n\nMan. There definitely was a feeling of “What if these two didn’t play each other today?” going around today amongst all the casters and staff. I know there’s nothing to be had in crying over spilled milk, but there’s just a small part of me that does think it’s kind of a bummer that the two had to meet this early. It’s just a very unfamiliar feeling, and I think a lot of people can relate. Maybe it’s how some high-FIFA ranking countries feel when they get matched with another powerhouse straight out of Groups in the World Cup.\n\nFor me, the series today definitely ranks Top 5 in my list of most epic series ever. Though that’s just off the top of my head, and I do think there is a bit of bias towards more recent games due to my memory of the past being a bit blurry. But today’s series is definitely up there.\n\nIt’s just rare for a series, especially an individual game like Game 2 to maintain that amount of sheer tension for almost a full hour. It’s like a battle of two masters, where you can’t afford to miss a single moment because a split second is all it takes for the match to be decided. Props to both GenG and HLE.\n\n \n\n“KT vs CFO?”\n\nFor me, I think KT are definitely favored. While the difference in favor isn’t too big, at least in my opinion. Maybe it will just come down to “Please Bdd, you’re our only hope.” But I do think the ideal scenario is actually Perfect pulling through, where him taking over both Driver and Rest will make the game very comfortable for KT to play.\n\n \n\nI’ll have to call it a day. I’m just too burnt out from today’s series. I need some time to myself to reflect on what I was witness to today. I’ll come back tomorrow after recharging. For now, I might just go admire the view of Shanghai from my room.

(21, 'reddit', '1oi2l81', 'Itinerary Review of the Charming Crescent City', 'Wow. I returned this morning to my CO home and am already planning a return trip. This city really left an impression and since I lurked for so long when planning our 3-day girls trip this past weekend (Type A Itinerary Planner here 👋🏼), I thought I\'d pay it forward by sharing my experience. I\'ll have a TLDR at the end, lol.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nThere was beautiful weather so we started the day exploring the French Quarter. We had coffee at French Truck Coffee, beignets at Cafe Beignet (mid but not bad), backtracked to grab a Pimm\'s Cup at the Carousel Bar (good), and visited Jackson Square.\n\nTook an Uber to Li\'l Dizzy\'s and wow, everything was so flavorful and exceeded my expectations, which were very high from all your reviews. We shared gumbo, fried chicken, a shrimp poboy, greens, mac and cheese, and potato salad. 10/10, across the board\n\nWe hopped the streetcar down to the French Market to grab our kids some souvenirs and had the BEST beignets of our trip at Loretta\'s. We tried regular as a baseline but the praline-filled? 🤌🏽 delish. Dinner was at Luizza\'s by the Track. The BBQ shrimp I had was another 10/10 and everyone left full and happy. \n\nSpent the night on Bourbon Street. Two of us left early (not feeling it) but myself and my bestie enjoyed a wild few hours. Lafitte\'s was chaotic so those drinks were to-go. Gay bars are always a blast so we hopped into Oz to dance a little bit and then walked down to a few more bars that were quick visits. Last stop was The Swamp to dance again before our feet called it quits. \n\nSATURDAY\n\nBreakfast was District Donuts and we all were happy with the chicken biscuit sandwiches and donuts. We walked around the Garden District a bit to check our some mansions but the rain ended up soaking us, despite our umbrellas. Got dry and took power naps at the hotel before dressing up in our Halloween costumes.\n\nSaw a bit of the Krewe of Boo parade (fun!) before our 730pm tour of the St. Louis Cemetery #1. Everyone was respectful of the environment and our group asked a lot of great questions so it was super informative. Our guide was also great so I recommend this tour if you\'re interested. I would recommend a day tour vs an evening one, so you can see all the details better. \n\nWe Ubered to Coop\'s Place for dinner and this hole in the wall was yet again, another 10 out of freaking 10! Gumbo, red beans and rice with smoked sausage, jambalaya, and etouffee were shared and cherished 😅. Walked over to Frenchmen Street and this was definitely more us.\n\nLe Maison, Cafe Negril, Blue Nile, Spotted Cat, Apple Barrel, 30/90- how could such a small street have so much awesome music and vibes?! So many talented musicians, artists, and singers?! Not only did the jams heal me but the Art Bazaar was dope too. It was all so fun!! I forced them to Key\'s Fuel Mart for fried chicken around 230am and it was great too! I think this was my favorite fried chicken of all but my alcohol consumption likely cancels the credibility of my review. \n\nSUNDAY\n\nA late start after a late night and 11am was a hard time to get into somewhere. We ended up just eating at a small place next to our hotel and it was good. Broke off and 2 of us went to the Audubon Zoo and 2 of us (incl me) went to the WW2 Museum. \n\nWe both enjoyed our trips and the museum was truly a mesmerizing experience. So heavy, yet so beautifully put together. It inspires a sense of patriotism I haven\'t felt in a while and in these tumultuous times for our country, I think it\'s worth a visit if you\'re here. Please note it is HUGE so plan this for a full morning or afternoon (3.5h min). We only had 3 hours allotted, leading to us missing a few portions and having to power walk past a few exhibits.\n\nThe 4 of us met up again at the French Quarter and got beignets at Cafe Du Monde and Bon\'s (regular and bananas fosters). Cafe du Monde was a fun experience and they were good, I liked them better than Cafe Beignet and Bon\'s but Loretta\'s is my queen! 👑 \n\nDinner was at Neyow\'s Creole Cafe and it was the perfect ending to the trip. Especially the bread pudding at the end. Our flight was at 5am so that was our trip!\n\nEvery person we met was kind, we never felt unsafe, and nothing was pickpocketed. There was a post here a little while ago that said she had an awful time and I don\'t know how that could be. You give what you get I guess, and the Crescent City cast a spell on me. ☺️\n\nThis sub was so helpful with recommendations and I hope this post can help with other visitors on their first trip. The amount to see and do is overwhelming but the chances of experiencing something great are pretty high. I wish this charming city and all it\'s lovely residents nothing but love and prosperity! 💕 \n\n\n\nTLDR- FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nRestaurant Ratings &amp; Food Favorites\n\n⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️\nLoretta\'s Pralines (Praline-filled)\nLi\'l Dizzy\'s (Fried Chicken, Gumbo)\nLuizza\'s by the Track (BBQ Shrimp)\nCoop\'s Place (Gumbo, red beans and rice)\nNeyow\'s Creole Cafe (red beans, bread pudding!!)\n\n⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️\nDistrict Donuts (chick bisc, root beer float donut)\nKey\'s Fuel Mart (Fried Chicken ** this should be 5 but I was drunk so not fair to compare to others)\nCafe du Monde (beignets, iced cafe au lait) \n\n⚜️⚜️⚜️\nFrench Truck Coffee, \nCafe Beignet, \nBon\'s\n\n\n\nFrenchmen Street &gt; Bourbon Street; \nSt. Louis #1 Cemetery Tour: Day &gt; Evening/Night; \nThe WWII Museum = ⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️\n\n\n\nHere\'s my \"next time\" list\', what\'d I miss? \n(I\'ll add if you recommend!)\n\n⚜️Dooky Chase\'s\n⚜️Brennan\'s (bananas foster, brunch)\n⚜️Croissant d\'Or\n⚜️Ayu Bakehouse\n⚜️Mr. B\'s Bistro (BBQ shrimp)\n⚜️The Turkey and The Wolf\n⚜️Bearcat\n⚜️City Park (NOMA, oaks, botanic gardens)\n⚜️New Orleans Pharmacy Museum\n⚜️Storyville Museum\n⚜️Domilise\'s (poboys)\n⚜️Parkway (poboys)', 'MountainMerMom', 'AskNOLA', 'https://reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1oi2l81/itinerary_review_of_the_charming_crescent_city/', 41, 13, '2025-10-28 12:56:43', '2025-11-07 23:40:40');

(22, 'reddit', '1okf9vu', '2024 Finnish Army 24hr Ration Review', 'Another long one - sorry not sorry haha. Unfortunately, because of the HD photos I had to upload screenshots because of reddit file size limits.\n\n**Intro**  \nTodays ration comes from the frosty nation of Finland, previously being a neutral non-NATO country, Finland\'s defence forces were in a way, quite isolated, and this reflects in the rarity of their rations. Finnish rations are extremely rare, only coming up for sale once in a blue moon - just a few months ago (at time of writing), some Finnish rations came up for sale, at 270 euros each, plus shipping. Hopefully that price, while insane, puts into perspective how rare these rations are, so I am very lucky, and very excited, to try this one out!\n\nFinnish rations contain freeze dried mains, as would be expected in a cold climate. The ration itself is produced by Leijona Catering, using \'OUTDOOR\' branded freeze dried meals produced by Leader. Most, if not all of the components of the ration are able to be purchased off the shelf and are produced in Finland, this is by design to protect the supply chain for rations during times of emergency or war. This particular ration contains 4085 calories and weights 1,123 grams, with a shelf life of about a year and a half.\n\nThe main meals for this ration are: Apple Cinnamon Rice Porridge, Pasta Carbonara and Chili Con Carne.\n\nThe other components in this ration were: Whole Rye Military Bread, Processed Ham Paste, Processed Vegetable Paste, Honey Salted Peanuts, 60% Cocoa Chocolate Bar, Banana Caramel Protein Bar, Black Tea (x2), Instant Coffee (x2), Cocoa Drink Mix, Cola Drink Mix (x2), Citrus Drink Mix(x2), Granulated Sugar (x2), Drink Whitener (x4), Disinfection Wipe (x4), Powdered Sriracha (x2), Xylitol Gum (x2) and Tissues.\n\nWith this being a 24hr ration, I\'ve broken this down into three meals for the day.\n\nFor breakfast: Rice Porridge, Milk Chocolate, Hot Chocolate and the Banana Caramel Bar.\n\nFor Lunch: a larger meal with the Pasta Carbonara, Honey Peanuts, Biscuits as well as the Ham and Veggie Spreads.\n\nFor Dinner: a smaller meal of Chili Con Carne, Milk Chocolate and a cup of tea.\n\nI tend not to review the drinks in these rations, so those will be omitted. I also don\'t drink coffee so those I will save for someone who will enjoy them!\n\n**Breakfast**  \n**Apple and Cinnamon Rice Porridge**  \nAfter opening the porridge packet I was greeted with a lighty fruity smell, as well as the aroma of cinnamon and oddly enough, rabbit bedding. If that sounds weird to you, it is, I was pretty surprised at that one, and unfortunately it\'s a smell we aren\'t leaving behind any time soon. The porridge called for 3.5 dl of water, or to be filled to the internal line number 10, I opted to fill to internal line 9.5 just in case. I also decided to give it 20 minutes to rehydrate instead of the required 15, just to ensure everything was rehydrated well.\n\nThe liquid for the porridge came out first, a little runny but still a good thickness, the rice porridge then all came out in a large blob, thick enough to plaster a wall very easily, if you ate it like that it would stick to your ribs! I couldnt shake that wood shavings bedding smell unfortunately. Mixing the porridge gave it a much more uniform consistency, still very thick, but you do not get shortchanged on the apple in the slightest, there could very easily be a whole apple in there!\n\nUnfortunately for me, it tasted pretty similar to how it smelt, the rice still had a little bite but wasn\'t too hard, the porridge wasn\'t particularly sweet and I think the odd taste came from the liquid in the porridge. This porridge was lactose free as well as gluten free, hence rice instead of oats, but the replacement for the milk in this was made from an assortment of fats and thickeners, it wasn\'t great I\'ll be honest. The apples were great though, they had their natural apple flavour, their texture was on point with a little bite and fibreous texture of a cooked apple, some parts had their skin on still which added a nice variation to the texture, the apples were great.\n\nI ate some more of the porridge for a while and the taste didn\'t bother me as much as it did initally and I thought, yeah maybe I can get behind this but I just couldn\'t. That weird taste kept growing, sure there was a lovely hint of cinnamon in the background and the bits of apple helped, but it didn\'t change the fact it tasted weird. The porridge wasn\'t very sweet, it tasted weird, the rice was certainly a unique texture, it left some gritty \'bitty\' parts in my mouth that were still a little hard, kind of unpleasant. No matter how I try and frame it, the porridge just sucked. It wasn\'t enjoyable for me, the only thing it had going for it was the fact it was warm, and that the apples were nice. I have no idea what that weird taste was but it just ruined the porridge.\n\nI did try my best to save the porridge, it may have been cheating since I hadn\'t had any chocolate yet but I broke up a little into the porridge and mixed it a bit, it helped the smallest bit but in reality could not save the porridge, I didn\'t add any more chocolate after that - it would\'ve simply been a waste. My next hail mary was to add in a sugar packet to see if that could help at all, and it did make the porridge sweeter, but that was it, still tasted weird and gross. I was originally going to finish the porridge so as not to waste food but I just couldn\'t. The porridge was horrible. It needed actual milk and it may have been nice, but unfortunately I cant say anything good about it par the apples, it was quite disappointing actually.\n\nLuckily, the rest of breakfast was pretty solid!\n\n**Dark Chocolate, Chocolate Banana Protein Bar and Cocoa**\n\nI started with the cocoa, it called for 3 dl of hot or cold milk or water, very versatile, I decided to go with hot water for the review since you don\'t exactly get milk with the ration. I was left with a cocoa with a deep brown, chocolatey sheen, it smelled strongly of cocoa. I took a sip and was greeted with a nice warming cocoa, it wasn\'t bitter and had a lovely chocolate flavour, but it definitely wasnt creamy or a hot chocolate - just cocoa. I decided to add one of the sugar packets to it just because I was wanting a hot chocolate style drink with breakfast, don\'t get me wrong this wasn\'t because the cocoa was bad, it was pretty tasty. The sugar definitely helped to give it some sweetness, even made it seem a little creamy, very warming and a perfect choice for breakfast.\n\nNext up, the dark chocolate, if you go to the gallery for this article (linked at the top) you can see the packaging for this chocolate, it was so pretty I actually felt bad opening it, so I opened carefully from the back to preserve the packaging. The chocolate is wonderful, it has a nice deep rich dark chocolate flavour, it isn\'t particularly sweet but it isn\'t bitter either. It gets a little creamy while you chew but definitely remains as dark chocolate, doesn\'t melt too easy and comes together well in your mouth with a intense and delicious chocolate flavour. This chocolate probably had the perfect amount of cocoa, and out of all the ration chocolate I\'ve had, is my favourite. It\'s just regular chocolate, it has a nice snap to it and breaks easily, it doesn\'t have the texture of other ration chocolates that break into little pebbles that only come together when you chew, from beggining to end, it\'s just regular chocolate and it\'s great!\n\nFinally, we have the banana caramel protein bar, it has a super strong artificial banana smell at first and threw me back to that banana flavoured medicine as a kid. The protein bar has a super thin chocolate coating that is almost lost flavour wise when you eat it, generic chocolate in the far background is as far as it went for me in flavour. The protein bar itself is thick and quite chewy with little crispy bits that seem to be mostly on the outside, the banana taste is artificial but it isn\'t too strong or unpleasant, there are little caramel chunks that give you a flavour burst and a different kind of chew at the end once you finish eating the rest of the bar. I\'m not sure what the crispy bits actually were but they had a puffed rice texture. Overall this bar was great! But it\'s definitely the sort of thing you take a bite of now and then while walking along. It has 23 grams of protein for those curious.\n\nOverall, I was quite happy with breakfast, the porridge was a bit of a downer but I didn\'t let it ruin the rest of breakfast. Pretty tasty breakfast all in all.\n\n\n\n**Lunch - Pasta Carbonara with Powdered Sriracha**  \nFor lunch we have the Pasta Carbonara, this one called for 3.5 dl of water, or up to line 9.5, like usual I decided to underfill and went to line 9. I didn\'t notice much smell when I first opened to rehyrate, but I did get a whiff when I opened it to eat it. The pasta did not smell like carbonara, instead smelling like bacon, smoke as well as garlic and the pasta, with a hint of tomato smell in there too.\n\nThe finnish do seem to love their creamy dishes it seems, as this was not a traditional carbonara, more a creamy tomato pasta. The pasta has a mild tomato taste to it, as well as onion, garlic and pepper - as a creamy tomato pasta, it\'s really good, as a carbonara, not so much. The pasta isnt too soft or mushy, it had a perfectly soft texture, and the onion in there was nice and crunchy and gave a good flavour, the onion definitely added a lot to the dish. The bacon bits, while tiny, were great, they had a natural bacon texture with some squidgy bite, flavour wise a nice standard smokey bacon, though you barely got any bacon. It seems to be with finnish rations they skimp you on the meat. Texturally, my only complaint was the fava bean groats, now I\'m not sure what fava bean groats are doing in a carbonara pasta, but they did not belong.\n\nThe fava bean groats were incredibly hard, pretty bad for the texture and they stuck out clearly against everything else, and did not add anything for the taste, I\'m not even sure why they were there but they were. Luckily, there weren\'t too many of the beans so it didn\'t ruin the meal or anything, it was still very tasty overall but was akin to a creamy tomato pasta as opposed to a carbonara. Seeing as the sauce was made of tomato powder, I\'m not sure why they called it a carbonara apart from the bacon, which itself isn\'t authentic, but I\'m not complaining, it was quite tasty! The sauce clung to the pasta as opposed to the pasta being in the sauce, which was nice - no sauce wasted.\n\nThe powdered sriracha is one of the main reasons I bought this ration, I am a fiend for sriracha anyways and powdered sriracha, in a ration, is completely unique and something I definitely wanted to try. On its own the sriracha had a good chili flavour with a decent tang, a hint of sweetness and a kick of spice that lingered in my throat, amazing! I added it to the pasta carbonara and it gave it a little bit of needed spice, but more than anything it added flavour. It made the pasta seem more tomato-ey which seems to be what it was really supposed to be. All in all the pasta was really enjoyable and quite filling.\n\n**Crispbread, Ham Paste and Vegetable Paste**  \nTo start with I decided to try some crispbread on its own to get an idea of the flavour I\'d be working with, it was very crispy and crunchy, chewed well, was airy and has a lovely wholegrain taste, you could definitely taste the grains sprinkled atop it, but I couldn\'t pick out anything specific, it was a very ambiguous rustic wholegrain flavour. The crispbread was pretty good actually, smell wise it was much the same as the taste, almost musty wholegrain smell, pretty generic.\n\nOn its own, the ham paste was very interesting to me, it\'s a little porky and a little smokey, and you do actually get the flavour of ham, but it is clearly very processed pork. Texture wise it is very smooth with a tiny bit of graininess. The smell actually reminded me a lot of the duck parmentier you can get out of a French RCIR, it is a super processed meat smell. It had an orange paste look to it, with a bit of a pink hue, not unlike a pate really.\n\nThe flavour of the crispbread and the ham works pretty well, but initially I did it wrong by squeezing some ham paste into a line on the crispbread, it is much more enjoyable spread out into a thin layer. Doing it this way allows the wholesomeness of the bread to work alongside the meatiness of the ham for a nice savoury treat that is rich, a little salty, a little smokey and very tasty. I personally do not like pate in the slightest but I really enjoyed this. The ham paste just tastes like ham after you chew it for a bit, it\'s crazy to me, but it\'s good.\n\nThe vegetable paste was significantly darker in colour than the ham paste, it looked much more like pate and did not come out of the tube easily at all, it had a spiced smell that gave off coriander, cardomam and aubergine (eggplant to non UK readers). The taste was odd, I could taste the different spices and you get a little bit of a spicy kick from it, but it didn\'t taste like vegetables. It\'s actually very hard to describe the taste of this, it was unique. Without reading the ingredients I couldn\'t tell you the vegetables in this, and after reading them all I got was \'Vegetable Fibre (peas)\'.\n\nThe taste of the vegetable paste with the crisp bread is alright, the spices shine through and it\'s quite savoury and spicy with an aftertaste almost like curry, I could pick up some turmeric but, again, unsure on the vegetable it was made from, texture wise it very much more similar to pate when being eaten too. It was nice, quite unique to me, though I did prefer the ham paste.\n\n  \n**Dinner - Chili Con Carne, Peanuts, Chocolate (+Final Thoughts)**  \nFinally, we have dinner, for which we are having the chili con carne. Rehydration requirement was 4 dl of water, or to line 10.5, I went to line 10. The chili right off the bat, is not a traditional chili con carne, it looks like a creamy rice stew, not a chili! I\'m starting to think the only colour food they have in finland is yellow... Anyways, the rice in the chili rehydrated well and was nice and soft. The beans, both brown and fava had a nice soft texture with a beany bite, as well as their natural flavour, but that flavour is lost amongst everything else for the most part sadly. Everything is very nicely spiced with a great spice mix made up of garlic, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili and coriander.\n\nThe beef was good, a very stong beefy taste, a little chewy but not overly so, though unfortunately not much to be found, this chili only consisted of 4% beef! There are little chunks of crunchy carrot, lovely texture but not much flavour, the onions in the chili were magnificent, crunchy and intense flavour, so nice. The chili was creamy but it was still so warming, filling and spicy, it\'s not traditional by any means but it was still delicious. I couldn\'t stop eating it once I started, it was amazing.\n\nThe peanuts were really nice, standard roasted peanut with a peanutty flavour, not too salty unless you sucked the outside. Not overroasted, a little crunch and a perfect bite, a delightful strong, natural honey flavour to them as well, I usually am not a peanut person but these were really good, the dust from the bottom of the bag was divine salty sweet heaven. Not all of the peanuts had a strong honey flavour which was nice, it seemed varied. I tried some with a bit of chocolate, it was pretty good, a nice salty and sweet combination but the chocolate actually overstepped the peanut flavour a bit, so I preferred to eat the chocolate alone. I also had the black ceylon tea, it wasn\'t the strongest but after adding some whitener it became a lot more like something I\'m used to here in England, warmed me up on what was a cold day!\n\nAfter all that, we are finally at the end of the review! Overall, my opinions on this ration are a little mixed but all said and done it was a pretty good ration. I think the freeze dried mains, especially breakfast, could use some improvement, they\'re a little unique compared to others, but I did enjoy them for the most part. This was a really enjoyable ration, great on a cold day and pretty tasty. Quite happy with this, glad to have tried such a rare treat!

(23, 'reddit', '1o3a8ck', 'Experiences in Taiwan', 'Hello everyone,\n\n\nIn May of this year I went to Taiwan on a two week solotrip. It\'s a bit overdue, but I wanted to write up some of my experiences traveling this island nation. The long and short of it is that this trip was easily one of the best I have ever made and I can highly recommend Taiwan as a destination - though maybe not in the month of May.\n\n\nMy itinerary for this trip was Taipei (four nights) - Sun Moon Lake - Alishan (one night each) - Tainan (three nights) - Kaohsiung (two nights) - Chishang  - Hualien (one night each) - Taipei (two nights - with a flight back at around 23:00). I covered all distances by train and I never rented a scooter or a car. I did rent bicycles in Sun Moon Lake, Chishang and Hualien.\n\n\nOut of all places, Taipei was by far my favorite. Part of this is definitely because it was my first taste of Taiwan in general. I very quickly took a liking to the arcades that not only provide protection from the sun and the rain, but also house an incredible collection of stores, restaurants, bike repair shops and temples. I also just really fell in love with the temples in general. Coming from Europe, I am used to churches being quiet, solemn places of worship. Temples and shrines in Japan have a similar solemn atmosphere to them. Temples in Taiwan on the other hand are lively, bustling with activity, the sense of incense and filled to the brim with what might be considered kitsch statues and ornaments. I think the first temple that really blew me away was the Ciyou temple near Raohe Night Market; from that point on I designed much of my stay in Taipei and Taiwan in general around temple hopping.\n\n\nI really just spent most my days wandering the many streets of Taipei, looking for temples and being charmed by the organised chaos. I tried to capture on camera just what it was that appealed so much to me about this city, but I absolutely couldn\'t. It\'s the hidden store filled with religious items. It\'s the sudden change in tiles being used in the pavement to something that wouldn\'t be misplaced in what would have been a really fancy hotel in the 80s. It\'s the green hills that surround the city, the parks within or the plants set up by residents on the streets that seem ready to take over entire buildings. It\'s the tiny restaurants where you eat an absolutely delicious meal for next to nothing. It\'s the heat and the humidity bringing a certain atmosphere, but also pushing you into the nearest convenience store for another Pocari Sweat. It\'s the temples, either hidden away between other houses, or on prominent display. It\'s the underground fortune telling street. It\'s the clean and wide subway stations and what awaits you at their exists. The night markets, the view from Taipei 101. I had intended to take day trips to Keeling and Jiufen in case I got bored, but I never did. Only on my last long day did I run out of things to visit, but that was mostly because I had a long flight in sight with no chance to shower beforehand. (Actually, there are showers at Tayouan Aiport, which I didn\'t know about.) If not for that, I would have visited Maokong and hiked among tea plantations.\n\n\nAfter the urban jungle, I made my way to Sun Moon Lake for some nature. To be honest, I feel like you can skip this place. It\'s mostly a resort for the Taiwanese to catch a break from the urban heat island effect. As far as I could tell, you can\'t actually swim in the lake. Cycling around was fun, but I made the mistake of renting a regular bike and had to cut my tour short to deal with the heat. Rent an electric bike if you do come, or maybe just skip it altogether.\n\n\nFrom Sun Moon Lake I took the bus to Alishan. I spent most my time here hiking on the various trails, enjoying the views and the nice cool temperatures. One thing I severely underestimated though was transportation to and form Alishan. My initial goal was to spend two nights here, hike on the first day and visit villages like Fenqi (en route to Alishan coming from Chiayi) on the second, then leave early the next day to make my way to Tainan (initially also a two night stay). On paper this is perfectly possible, but busses in the area aren\'t frequent and space is limited. Going to Tainan from Alishan takes about four hours, so I really only would have had one and a half days to explore. I changed my plans and cancelled my second night (I only got 10% of what I paid back, but hotels in the park are so expensive that that was just 200 NTD short of a last minute extra night in Tainan) and forewent my plans for the second day. If you decide to visit, I highly suggest entering the park from Chiayi rather from Sun Moon Lake and stopping along the way in the smaller villages. For me, I kind of just realized I\'d rather visit cities in East Asian countries as they are what truly set them apart from Europe, in my opinion. Alishan was nice, but I prefer the Alps. Having your own transportation or traveling with a single bag would also made my plans considerably easier to achieve.\n\n\nMy second favorite destination was Tainan, which isn\'t surprising given that I liked the temples in Taipei so much. As any Taiwanese will tell you, Tainan was the old capital on the island and thus hosts many of the country\'s oldest temples. I spent my first full day there just going on a temple spree in the city center, which may have just been my single favorite day on the trip. Like in Taipei, some temples are grand buildings that demand all your attention, others are tucked way in alleyways. While walking to them, you walk along the same covered arcades as in Taipei, passing similar restaurants, stores, or just people sitting in their garage watching the world go by. Just when the heat gets to you, you can fill up your water bottle in a temple and find a nice spot in front of a fan, admiring the ornate decorations. Maybe some people are praying, maybe some people are chanting, maybe it\'s quiet.\n\n\nMy second day I spent mostly in the Anping area, which was less to my liking. As a general note for Tainan and really the whole of Taiwan: if a place had an entry fee, I usually didn\'t think it was worth it (main exception being the National Palace Museum in Taipei). Another negative for me was the lack of public transportation. The city does not have an MRT station; busses were often delayed. The Anping area is also a lot less built up, which meant fewer arcades to walk underneath, more exposure to the sun.\n\n\nKaohsiung was my next destination. I really didn\'t get to explore this city to my liking due to the heat. I only did everything I wanted to do on Cijin island; other places like Lotus Pond or Shoushan I either didn\'t visit or I cut my visit short because of the heat. Next time I come to Taiwan I will be sure to spend some more time here. There is an MRT in Kaohsiung, but it is very limited in where it will take you, so busses were still a necessity. I wandered the streets during the evening, visiting the (only?) night market. I need to give it another chance next time I visit to really give the city a fair shake.\n\n\nFrom Kaohsiung I took an early morning train to Chishang. I spent a good couple of hours cycling among the rice fields, which was really fun to do. Great views and a nice serene atmosphere, with mountains in view. The experience did turn sour for me in the afternoon, though. I was following a route advertised on tourist maps which could roughly be divided into a southern part (south of the main road leading into and through the city) among the rice fields and a northern part. From the south west onwards though (close to the main road) and for really the entirety of the northern section, there were a lot of unleashed guard dogs that were very territorial. I happen to dislike dogs, but I don\'t think most dog lovers like it either when a big barking dog comes charging at them. The whole northern part of this route wasn\'t impressive anyway, so I would just stick to touring among the rice fields if you decide to visit.\n\n\nMy final new destination was Hualien, the largest city on Taiwan\'s east coast. Taroko Gorge is the foremost tourist attraction in the area, but as of my visit it was still closed after an earthquake. I cycled to Qixingtan Beach, which was nice but really not worth the effort in my opinion. I was really curious to see what Hualien was like and I feel like I got a good impression cycling around some after coming back from Qixingtan. Nice enough, but definitely skippable. Also here there were a lot of unleashed dogs, but these were actually strays that did not care for me as I walked or cycled past, so it didn\'t bother me that much (though I did find it weird that there were so many of them).\n\n\nThat\'s my rather long write-up on Taiwan. If I were to visit a next time, I definitely would plan my trip during a more bearable season in terms of heat. I don\'t regret going when I did as it just came out really well in terms of work, but it\'s definitely something to take into consideration if you can\'t handle heat very well like me.\n\n\nLanguage wasn\'t much of an issue. For what it\'s worth, I don\'t speak Chinese but as I can speak some Japanese, I was able to read a reasonable amount of stuff (though mostly just random signs like \"no parking\"). The Taiwanese were very friendly - with special thanks to the two Taiwanese-American couples who struck up a conversation with me in restaurants at Sun Moon Lake and in Chishang, offering me food and interpreting for other guests and the owners.\n\n\nThanks for reading!', 'bananensoep', 'solotravel', 'https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1o3a8ck/experiences_in_taiwan/', 43, 13, '2025-10-11 01:18:31', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Full-time at-home cat lady.\n\n**Hometown:** Somewhere in Southeast Asia. Low cost of living. I\'m travelling from the Middle East, where we have been living for three years.\n\n**Section Two: Assets + Debt** \n\n**Retirement Balance:** $24,000. This is my own. I don\'t know my husband\'s retirement balance, but I think it should be about the same or a little higher now, as he started working later than I did.\n\n**Savings accounts balance:** $78,000. Partly emergency funds, majority for our house fund. This is combined with my husband, though it\'s split in half between his account and mine.\n\n**Checking account balance:** $4,000.\n\n**Credit card debt:** $0. We pay it off in full every month.\n\n**Student loan debt:** $0. Both of us received scholarships.\n\n**Section Three: Income**\n\n**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $1,500-$1,600. I save $200-$300 every month towards retirement and invest whenever I hit $1.8k. Husband\'s take-home income is $5,000. We are solidly middle class in our home country.\n\n**Any Other Monthly Income:** my husband gives me $900 each month, partly because in our religion and culture it\'s his obligation to clothe, feed, and house the wife, and partly because I\'m on a sabbatical with a 60% reduction in pay to join him at his new job in the Middle East (my \"pay\" is part of his job\'s benefits and gets deposited directly into my account). It makes me feel better about pausing my career and missing out on my employer\'s retirement match!\n\n**Section Four: Travel Expenses**\n\n**Transportation:-**\n\n**Flights:** $4,400 for the two of us. I booked mine first in July thinking I was going to go alone, and I bought business class only for my departing flight; then he got the go-ahead for his leave, so he bought economy seats for himself a couple of weeks before our flight date!\n\n$40 for the ride to the airport and back.\n\n**Accommodations:** $108 for the overnight hotel. We mainly stayed at my in-laws\'.\n\n**Pre-Vacation Spending:** \n\n$200 for three weeks\' pet supplies, particularly wet food because one of our cats can\'t eat dry food at all at the moment so we have been feeding him exclusively wet food (we usually feed wet and dry). He also has to be on prescription food, and that\'s more expensive than regular cat food.  I bought three weeks\' worth because I\'m a paranoid owner, like what if we get delayed a week or more before we could get back?!\n\n$360 for the cat sitter to come twice a day for nine days to feed our two cats and clean up after them.\n\n$20 to get our bedding in our room laundered before we arrive.\n\n$193.70 in gifts: chocolates, perfumes, and snacks.\n\n\\--\n\nIt took about 4 months to save for the trip, especially because I wanted business class at least for the departing flight. I skimped on my last trip home of similar length where I took the cheapest route with multiple transits and my body was stiff until two days before my return flight. I was miserable and lacked energy for the majority of the time, which really ruined the trip for me! This time, I wanted to \"invest\" in a comfortable departing flight, in order to look and feel good for the wedding events, as well as have energy to do our many pending errands and spend time with my loved ones.\n\n\\--\n\n**Day 1:** Flight day. A chaotic affair before leaving the house because my husband got unexpectedly swamped with overtime work before his leave and I just didn\'t have the mental capacity after finding out our first IUI failed. We tidy up as best as we can and feed the cats early in the morning and just before going out the door. While taking a break from tidying, my husband goes out and gets both of us a laban drink, a yoghurt bowl with granola, and a hazelnut croissant for each of us for $10. I eat only the croissant. At the airport, we make use of the free lounge access and eat our fill. I still feel like crap having to leave the cats, so to make myself feel better I get a bag of my favourite chips from Pret ($4) before heading in. The flight is long, but having my ereader (Boox Palma 2, The Belle of Belgrave Square by Mimi Matthews, 4/5) and being able to fully recline make the time pass very comfortably!\n\n*Total: $14*\n\n**Day 2:** We arrive midmorning, and we\'re hungry for a taste of home. My in-laws greet us at the airport. We drag them to our favourite kopitiam for noodles and teh tarik, where we bump into not one, two, nor three, but *four* separate groups of relatives. I guess since the last time I went, it became everybody\'s favourite?! My mother-in-law pays for our table. My husband and I share a laugh when we see the total is $32.90 for 6 people. My body doesn\'t hurt at all, so I\'m chipper and energised to take on the day!\n\nWe go to my in-laws\' to unpack, then we\'re back out the door within the hour. Our second stop of the day is the hair salon! As the stylist combs my wet hair to cut my bangs, my self-esteem takes a giant blow when I look in the mirror and see just how much my hair has thinned out since my last cut; a side effect of going through fertility treatments. We pay $40 for my cut + wash + \"hair treatment\" + dry, $30 for my husband\'s cut + wash + dry, and $30 for a pomade product for my husband. I leave with my heart feeling battered and bruised.\n\nAfterwards, I stop by the department store to buy a mirror that lights up ($39.99) so I can put on makeup for ID photos and my cousin\'s three wedding events. On the way home, we buy gas for the car with the only cash we have on hand ($17).\n\nWe have dinner at my grandparents\', and by some great mercy and miracle they don\'t mention great-grandchildren even once. They ask about our cats instead, and I love them for that.\n\n*Total: $139.99*\n\n**Day 3:** Before running errands, my husband and I have breakfast at another favourite kopitiam, where we get roti with egg, mee mamak with a sunny side up egg on top, and teh tarik. My eyes bulge out of my sockets in disbelief at the $9.30 total.\n\nWe realise it\'s payday for the public sector when we see there are queues at every ATM at 9am on a Monday. We spend 30 minutes trying to find parking and waiting in line only to find out my husband\'s card doesn\'t work, so off we go to a branch that allows withdrawal over the counter. When we reach the bank, my brother texts that he\'s sending my cousin\'s physical wedding invitation card to my in-laws\' house, and as I hit reply, my husband taps me on the shoulder to point out my brother\'s wife staring at me! I\'ve just missed him dropping her off! This country is ridiculously small.\n\nWe go to another bank to deposit the cash, and while waiting for our turn I pop by the cafe next door for $5 iced lemon tea. This is grossly expensive, but it\'s delicious on a hot day so I fork out the cash anyway. After a mildly stressful appointment with our banker, we go to the cafe again for a honey cake and something called a jellatte, a latte with coffee jelly ($13.50 total).\n\nFor dinner, while my husband sends our event clothes for ironing ($5 for seven items!!!), I meet up with a best friend (A) at a restaurant, where I laugh looking at the prices. We order chicken rice each, a vegetable dish, ice lemon tea, and iced bandung cincau. I pay the $16 total for both of us.\n\nWe stop by a drugstore to get razors, eyeliner, and a foundation brush for $23. I accompany her for a couple of errands before she drops me off at home.\n\n*Total: $66.80*\n\n**Day 4:** I try out my new mirror for the first time while putting on makeup for a new ID photo. I haven\'t worn a full face of makeup in probably a whole year, so I stick to the basics and end up loving my look. We arrive just as the immigration department opens, which is as depressing as you can imagine, but things move fast and it\'s not even 8.30am yet when we finish ($30).\n\nWe swing by the printers to print some documents for the bank (we\'re buying land!) for $5 before heading for our 9.30am appointment with our banker. We\'re there for so long that we miss breakfast entirely. After picking up our clothes, we head to an old favourite during our dating days for lunch ($27). \n\nIn the afternoon, while my husband is at his massage appointment ($30 + $10 tip), I go to another drugstore to pick up more supplies. I get a couple more makeup brushes, a sponge, primer, eyebrow gel, and four bottles of our face cleanser to bring back for $100.80.\n\nI still have time to kill before picking up my husband, so I get a no-polish manicure for $12 + $8 tip two minutes away. Bestie A mentioned the last time I saw her that she keeps forgetting her phone, so after my manicure, I buy a crossbody phone strap ($30) for her at the mall one minute away from the nail salon. My husband texts that he\'s finished just as I\'m heading back to my car.\n\nWe go to KFC to get cheesy wedges (they don\'t have them in the Middle East) and while there, we find out they sell really cute cat costumes! We\'ve been wanting some for our annual Eid family photos. We buy two for our cats, and surprisingly each came with free chicken. The total ends up being $38.10.\n\nI find out the primer is a dud that evening when my foundation just won\'t settle, so my makeup ends up just being passable. We head to the first of my cousin\'s wedding events, where I meet a cousin\'s son for the first time. He takes to my husband better than he does me, ugh. I have a lovely time catching up with relatives until we leave at 11.30pm when the sky threatens a storm.\n\n*Total: $304.90*\n\n**Day 5:** I drive to two out of the three banks I have an account with to close my accounts, with one of them being such an ordeal it completely drains me. The overarching theme of our return must be banking errands, however, because just as I\'m about to drive to meet up with my childhood best friend for lunch, my husband receives a notice about his nonfunctional card. \n\nI pick him up from home and we go to lunch at a nice Italian fusion restaurant. Everybody gets pasta, and my husband gets an iced yuzu tea and I get their delicious iced peach tea twice. Our portion ends up being $41.\n\nI fall asleep in the car while waiting for him to be done at the bank, and I continue sleeping at home just until it\'s time to get ready for the second wedding event. I don\'t even notice the heavy rain outside nor that the power\'s gone out during my nap, and my husband has to send our laundry to be finished at the laundromat ($20). \n\nWe get ready mainly in the dark, only using the light from my mirror. This time I eschew the primer and my makeup sinks in beautifully. We leave the event early at 9.30pm because I feel fit to drop, and thankfully everyone accepts my excuses. Someone asks if we haven\'t yet \"caught\" for a baby just as I\'m going out the door. My heart sinks, and I am so, so tired. The power\'s back on by the time we reach home, and I take the minimum effort to clean up and immediately go to bed.\n\n*Total: $61*\n\n**Day 6:** My husband wants to sleep in, so I go out by myself to meet another best friend for breakfast as she\'s in my area to get some work done on her car. I pick her up at the workshop at 10am. I order wonton kolomee for myself and another to-go for my husband, and she gets roasted duck rice. With drinks, the total ends up being $21.10. I pay. I drop off my best friend at her house and drive home.\n\nMy husband and I stay home until we get hungry around 5pm. We go to an asian fusion restaurant ($45) and get $1 ice cream for dessert. I\'m still feeling tired and weak, so I\'m asleep by 9pm.\n\n*Total: $67.10*\n\n**Day 7:** We sleep in late, and have tea and some traditional kuih at home for breakfast. We meet my husband\'s aunt for lunch after the Friday prayer where it turns out she\'s invited five other relatives as well, along with my husband\'s parents and brothers. I eat my fill while trying to ignore the overstimulation. I decline to go to the movies with the ladies. The aunt pays.\n\nIn the evening, we go to my cousin\'s third and final wedding event. I give her $200. My husband\'s granduncle is also coincidentally having his 93rd birthday party at the same time, so my husband drops me off at the wedding venue before going to the party. He stays just long enough to pay his respects, then rushes back to the wedding in time to eat. As the eldest niece, I\'m expected to help and stay until after the very last guest leaves, so we end up staying until 11.30pm. My feet hurt and my social battery is at an all-time low.\n\nTo decompress, we get a single ice cream ($3.80) to share and eat in the car before heading home.\n\n*Total: $203.80*\n\n**Day 8:** My husband and I meet up with three of our friends for a dim sum brunch. I nearly cry at my first bite of actually decent dim sum since we moved away. My husband pays for everyone ($60).\n\nAfterwards, I meet A again and she drives us to her favourite cafe an hour away, near where another best friend lives. We share extremely delicious desserts and mediocre matcha, and A pays ($41). A drives me home. While I was with my friends, my husband hung out with another group of his friends, but didn\'t buy anything. He does buy me two packs of plasters ($4.40) on the way home, for a wound on my ankle I\'ve been nursing.\n\n*Total: $64.40*\n\n**Day 9:** My husband booked us a hotel room for one night in a city 3 hours away, so we top up on gas ($20) and have breakfast (roasted duck rice for each of us, ice lemon tea, and kopi o for $28) before leaving. On the way, we pay $3 in tolls.\n\nWe find out we\'ve been upgraded to the Executive Suite with a sea view at check-in! The room is just okay but the view is killer. After a short break to stretch our legs, we grab a late lunch ($30), then go shopping! We pick up a fancy Philips steam iron that comes with an extra-wide ironing board ($233) and take several minutes struggling to put it into my sedan. I can\'t resist the Kate Spade Halo bag in the store ($470), and showing great restraint afterwards I only buy one sports bra ($28) and a coffee bun ($1). My husband buys joggers and shorts ($50), and a pair of jeans and a shirt from Levi\'s ($133.75). On the way back to the hotel, my husband gets the news that our friend\'s mum has passed away. We agree to give them $100 as a bereavement gift.\n\nWe\'re so tired from the day that we can\'t be bothered to leave our room to get dinner. Since we\'re taking a break from actively trying to conceive for a few months to get the money ready for a second IUI (I have PCOS and don\'t ovulate on my own so need medication and monitoring), I temporarily lift the ban on taking baths. We enjoy a long hot soak together until the water starts to cool.\n\nI order seafood fried rice and my husband gets mushroom soup through the in-room dining service ($20). While waiting, I make us tea and we watch the first episode of the new season of our comfort show, Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill. I finally feel relaxed and refreshed.\n\n*Total: $1,116.75*\n\n**Day 10:** We pay $45 for the breakfast buffet. They have a good selection of western and local dishes, and everything we try is cooked well. We get back to our room at 8.30am, and my husband immediately decides to take a nap. I pack up our stuff, after which I get lured into lying down as well and end up napping until 11.45am, 15 minutes before check-out time.\n\nThere\'s a selection of really cute woven basket bags made by indigenous women at the hotel lobby, and I decide to get five of a mini design (one of the bags is, of course, for myself) to give as souvenirs for our friends where we currently live ($93.75).\n\nAfter check-out, my husband wants to get a hot stone massage, which takes 90 minutes ($63). I get a buff and shine manicure ($19) while waiting, then spend the rest of the time playing archived New York Times\' Strands in the car. I get so engrossed in the games that I don\'t even notice the parking ticket under the windshield wiper until after my husband returns! We immediately go to the municipality office to pay the fine, and our promptness gets us a discount so we only end up paying a measly $2! Afterwards, we try a new-to-us restaurant to eat what turns out to be ridiculously good laksa ($20).\n\nOn the way back to his parents\' house, we stop by a fruit market. My husband loads the car with a dizzying $100 worth of durian and rambutan. The car immediately fills up with the creamy smell of durian, of which thankfully we both love.\n\nWe pay the $3 toll on the way, and finally reach home just before 7pm. We still have to pack for tomorrow\'s flight! We\'re both tired and cranky, and packing is a test of patience for both of us. We hug and thank each other for powering through it when we finish.\n\nAt around 10pm, A texts me while I\'m already in bed to tell me she\'s ready to invest. We had made a pact to make our investments at the same time since I convinced her to start investing if only so we can still travel together after retirement, and I\'ve just been waiting for her. We text each other minute updates. The platform keeps crashing and we keep getting logged out, but we persevere and I invest $1,959.91 into an ETF (&gt;!SPWO!&lt;) and pay $26.23 in platform and exchange rate fees.\n\n*Total: $2305.66*\n\n**Day 11:** Flight day! My husband had to change his ticket at the last minute, which was covered by his work, so I have to go back early by myself (my ticket change would have cost over $1,000). I grab my last breakfast with home flavours at the airport with my in-laws after checking in. My mother-in-law pays. My childhood best friend brings her precious baby son to the airport to send me off. He struggles to remember me since the last time we saw each other he was only three months old, but we get along tolerably well long enough to take pictures with me holding him.\n\nMy mum and grandparents stop by the airport to send me off too, and as we hug, my grandmother tells me she\'ll keep praying for us to have a baby soon. I have to hold back the sudden tears, so I rush to go in for security checks before boarding.\n\nThe airline ground staff did me a solid when he checked me in, because I somehow get the whole row to myself and there isn\'t anyone behind my seat. I recline without guilt, and stretch out as much as I can throughout the long flight. I forgot to download the new book I wanted to read before my flight (another Mimi Matthews), and I don\'t want to read anything else, so I split the 10 hour journey between napping, snacking, and thinking about our household budget.\n\nWith time difference magic, I arrive in the late afternoon, where a driver picks me up from the airport, who was prepaid before my trip. I get home just in time to feed my cats and give them lots of loving. \n\n*Total: $0*\n\n***Grand Total: $9,468.10***\n\n**Reflections**\n\nThis was a really expensive trip! I felt like money just kept falling between my fingers by the minute. The biggest expense was the business class ticket and our tickets on the whole, but there were also things that built up, like the pet-related expenses and shopping (mainly for me), and I don\'t really know if I should count the investing as \"spending\". I felt we actually underpaid with regards to treating our friends and family... and in fact, we didn\'t even manage to get to pay even once for a family meal. Next time, I\'d like to be faster in reaching for the bill!\n\nI also kind of dislike how every time I go back to our home country, I\'m always swamped with life administrative errands that demand our physical presence, but it\'s just the nature of how our country works, unfortunately. We\'re expecting to go back again soon to sort out the mortgage, and I\'m honestly dreading \\*that\\* future trip already, because I actually didn\'t get to do all the things I needed to get done, due to scheduling unavailability during the dates I was at home. While I feel business class was worth it for this trip, I don’t think I would pay for it again for trips in the near future, as we\'re also saving for the second and potentially third IUI, or even maybe IVF in 2026, though of course I hope we don\'t have to go through with them to finally have a baby.\n\nWriting this diary as the trip went on was so fun, and I hope everyone enjoyed reading it as I did putting it together!', 'f-albedo', 'MoneyDiariesACTIVE', 'https://reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1opu4xa/i_make_85k_hhi_and_spent_92k_on_a_trip_to_my/', 59, 7, '2025-11-06 16:08:20', '2025-11-07 23:40:40');

(25, 'reddit', '1o2bn6b', 'When the Dutch Occupied the Abode of Lord Murugan: Competition for Pearls Along the Fisheries Coast', '### An Icon Seized and a People Distressed \n\nIn February 3, 1649, a punitive force of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) landed on the shores of the Tiruchendur, going onto occupy its famous Subramaniya Temple, one of the Six Abodes of Murugan (*Arupataivitukal*). Following the siege they held hostage the *mulamurti* and an *utsavamurti*, using it for ransom in what they what they deemed restitution. What were they seeking restitution for? What led to this series of dramatic events provides us a landscape of intense competition along the shores of the Fisheries Coast for its famed pearls, where intrigue and double-crossing among its various participants, be they indigenous such as the Madurai Nayakas, Ramnad Thevars, Muslim Maraikkayars and Christian Parava pearl divers, or European primarily in the form of the Dutch and the Portuguese. In this we heavily refer to a fascinating work of history by the scholar Markus PM Vink.\n\n### A Pearl of One\'s Eyes: Looking for Riches in the Fisheries Coast\n\nThe fisheries coast refers to the coastal region around Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) in present-day southern Tamil Nadu, renowned for its rich pearl fisheries where pearl divers belonging primarily to Christian and Muslim faiths for a long time provided some of the world\'s finest pearls.**[Image 7]**. The competition over who would control it raged the strongest in from the mid-17th century as the Dutch entered the shores of Madurai in 1645 in a crowded field where the Portuguese with their Parava allies had established a strong foothold. The Portuguese had a head-start of almost a century with St Francis Xavier having converted a substantial portion of the coastal fishing communities to Catholicism by this time, bringing them also under the protection of thr Portuguese crown. It is in this context that the Dutch sought to build a network among the Muslim Maraikkayars who for long had operated from the shores of Kayalpattanam nearby. The Maraikkayars, like their synonymous counterparts in the western Malabar coast, had a fractious relationship with the Portuguese, as described by another user [here](https://sh.reddit.com/r/IndianHistory/comments/1jyayup/comment/mn0luiw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) and hence readily allied with the Dutch. And while the fishery was conducted under the jurisdiction of the Nayaka *aranmanai* (palace), de facto control of the region was with the Thevars of Ramnad (who would go onto take the title Sethupathi and would be considered a Zamindari estate by the British). Hence we see a very crowded field here. \n\n### The VOC Come to Madurai\n\nThe Dutch VOC from their base in Pulicat near Madras tried eastablishing operations in Gingee and Thanjavur, however finding conditions difficult there and being subject to the intrigues of a wily trader named Chinnanna Chetti, they decided to try their luck in Madurai on March 1645:\n\n&gt;In early April 1645, Van der Meijden was dispatched from Pulicat aboard\nthe yacht ‘Grijpskercke’ with a cargo valued at 42,000 guilders to Porto Novo (Parangipettai). From there Van der Meijden was to embark on the galiot ‘Bracq’ and sail via Pamban Channel and Karaikal to Kayalpatnam. **Thence he was to proceed overland to the Nayaka of Madurai along with his ambassador ‘in order to request confirmation of the trade offered in the forms of a sound *qaul* along with an appropriate place of residence.\'**\n\n&gt;Almost three months later, at the end of July 1645, Van der Meijden returned to Pulicat with the flute ‘Heemskerk’ and galiot ‘Bracq’, carrying over 25,000 guilders in textiles, saltpetre, indigo, rockfish skins, slaves, chanks, and cowries, and, **more importantly, a *qaul* from Tirumalai Nayaka. The Madurai ruler granted the Company permission to trade freely in his territories; allowed for the remission of half the import duties,** while gold, silver, precious stones, silk textiles and gifts were completely exempt; promised exemption from three-quarters\nof the export duties and half of the tolls in the interior; accorded preferential rights in the collection of arrears from local merchants; pledged assistance in salvaging wrecked Company vessels on his coast; vowed not to increase the customary chungam or customs; **and promised not to force the Company to provide him with assistance against the Portuguese, English, Danes, or any other nation.**\n\nWith the *qaul* (authorisation) from the Madurai Nayaka now granted, the VOC proceeded to commence operations in the region from Kayalpatnam in the region. The port known as Qa\'il by the Arabs, was no longer as prominent as it was in the past, yet it remained strategically important to be a base of operations for the VOC in the region:\n\n&gt;Van der Meijden also recommended Kayalpatnam as the proper site for a Company settlement, **as it could be conveniently serviced either by small craft from Tondi or larger vessels from Ceylon. Situated at the mouth of the Tambraparni River on the Gulf of Mannaar, it would be ideally located to provision the Company garrisons at Galle and Negombo with rice and textiles, participate in the overland trade with Malabar exchanging local commodities,** such as rice and coarse textiles, for pepper, and would provide the Company with textile varieties (among others, *kachchais*, *chiavonys* and *beatilhas*), popular both in Europe and Asia, and available at cheaper rates than elsewhere on the Coromandel Coast\n\nThe local Muslim population was enthusiastic in this endeavour in what they viewed as a necessary counter to Portuguese domination along with their Parava allies in the region:\n\n&gt;In September 1645 Van der Meijden left Pulicat via Ceylon for Kayalpatnam with a cargo of lead, tin, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and so forth, valued over 40,000 guilders, required for trade in the lands of Madurai, in order to establish a local trading settlement. **In spite of its relative decline, Kayalpatnam by any standards was still a sizeable\ntown and one of the most important ports on the Madurai Coast. In 1665,\nfor instance, Captain Hendrick van Rheede estimated the number of inhabitants at Kayalpatnam, all held to be ‘Moors’, at about 10,000, and the number of locally owned vessels at 102, while in the pearl fisheries of 1668 and 1669 Kayalpatnam was well-represented as well with 66 vessels (2,398 persons) and 81 vessels (2,633) participating.**\n\n&gt;**During this period, the Kayalpatnam Maraikkayars were willing partners of the Company as part of a marriage of convenience in which they hoped to find a counterweight against the Portuguese-Parava combination, increasingly threatening their commercial freedom and share in the pearl fishery.**\n\n&gt;**As mentioned earlier, the local Muslim population was governed by a\nMudaliyar Pillai Maraikkayar supported by four *ambalakkarars* or revenue officers.** In February 1650, for instance, Vadamalaiyappa Pillai, the governor of Tirunelveli, wrote an *olai* to a certain Narayana Mudaliyar, who styled himself the *adhikari* (lit. ‘one possessing authority’) of Kayalpatnam\n\nThe Portuguese as expected were not keen on this development, viewing it as a violation of what they perceived to be their exclusive right among the European trading powers:\n\n&gt;**From its inception, the Company’s trade in Madurai and their alliance with the Kayalpatnam Maraikkayars was opposed and obstructed by the Portuguese- Parava combination. As early as August 1645, at the order of the Portuguese Viceroy at Goa, Dom Felipe Mascarenhas (1645–1651), the Portuguese captain-major (*capitão-mór*) of Saõ Tomé, Dom Luís de Melo, sent a protest letter to governor Heussen at Pulicat. De Melo objected to the admission of the Company to the Fishery Coast, which, he argued, had been granted to the Portuguese by contract for a hundred years. De Melo, therefore, requested Heussen to abandon the project and instead invited him to establish the Company’s trade in Madurai at Tuticorin under Portuguese auspices.** Heussen, not impressed by the protest, replied that the Nayaka himself had granted the voc free trade in his lands, and that he would study the offer of trading at Tuticorin.\n\n&gt;In February 1646, for instance, ‘at the request of the Moors’, an attempt was made to inspect the pearl banks in front of Kayalpatnam with 10 small *thonis*, the first logical step toward a pearl fishery. **The attempt, however, was nipped in the bud by the Portuguese resident at Tuticorin.**\n\nHowever in spite of these tensions, trade from Kayalpatnam cotinued briskly with the following reports:\n\n&gt;**A reconstruction of the shipping lists of 1645–1648 (with those of 1645–1646 being almost complete) seem to suggest that the annual imports and exports from southern Coromandel hovered around 200,000 guilders. These figures are corroborated by contemporary statements of Company officials.** In August 1646, for instance, Governor Heussen of Coromandel estimated that the total exports of Karaikal, Trimelevas, and Kayalpatnam since the beginning of August 1645 had amounted to more than 200,000 guilders. Heussen’s successor, Governor Laurens Pit, stated in September 1657 that the factories in southern Coromandel were unable to export more than 300,000 guilders a year and ‘that in previous times when the sales at Batavia were opulent, the demands from Europe were unlimited, and, in the absence of local obstacles, the south had never exported much more than two tons of gold [200,000 guilders]’.\n\nHowever such a state of affairs was not to last long as soon the trading post and factory would be subject to a combined Portuguese-Parava attack with what the Dutch believed to tacit acknowledgement, if not active connivance, by the Madurai *aranmanai* and its officials.\n\n### First Strike: The Portuguese Attack Kayal\n\nThere seem to have a expectations gap developing in the relationship between the Dutch and the Madurai *aranmanai* in this time period, with the latter not getting the commercial benefits it expected from its concessions, which is described as follows:\n\n&gt;**It seems very likely that the Nayaka authorities by this time had also become utterly disappointed in the commercial and political usefulness of their newfound allies. A trading settlement with a few Company servants, an annual turnover of 70,000 guilders, and no embassies forthcoming with valuable presents for the court officials can only have made a poor impression on the Madurai authorities.** Instead, they must have come to realise that, at least for the moment, they could ill-afford to ignore the strength of the Portuguese and their Parava allies on the coast. With the internal affairs of Ramnad settling down under Raghunatha Tevar or Tirumalai Setupati (r. 1645–1673), who, because of the death of his two rivals, had become the sole ruler of the Ramnad principality, there was also less opportunity for fishing in troubled waters, at least for the time being.\n\nThis is where the Portuguese siezed an opportunity to build on this distrust:\n\n&gt;Portuguese efforts in this context received an extra stimulus in\nFebruary 1646 when **King Dom João IV of Portugal (r. 1640–1656) sent unambiguous instructions to his Viceroy Dom Felipe Mascarenhas at Goa, that while the Ten Years’ Truce was in force the Estado da India should try to use proxy war tactics encouraging Asian rulers to fight against the Dutch.** \n\n&gt;**In late 1646 one Vithoji employed by the Portuguese captain of Tuticorin Dom João Garcia Sarmento, and several Parava headmen, including Dom Henrique da Cruz, traveled to Sivanandiappa Pillai at Palaiyamkottai and subsequently to Tirumalai Nayaka at Madurai. Vithoji and his Parava associates cleverly worked on the desire for personal gain of the ‘Great Nayaka’ and his governor at Palaiyamkottai arguing that the Company had not kept its promise to shower them with annual gifts, including elephants.** Requesting the expulsion of the Dutch, they promised in their turn 3,000 reals (9,000 guilders) to Sivanandiappa Pillai and another 5,000 reals (15,000 guilders) to Tirumalai Nayaka.\n\nWhile these efforts to gift/bribe the Madurai authorities to look the other way when attacking Dutch establishments in the region did not instantly pay off, subsequent efforts paid off:\n\n&gt;It does not appear that this particular effort to dislodge the Company from the Madurai Coast was immediately successful, **but a similar attempt the next year certainly was. In two later Company surveys of the relations with the Nayaka of Madurai during this period, it was reported that the governor of Tirunelveli, the Brahmin Deva Chatira Ayya (d. 1668) had accepted a bribe of 3,000 reals, not only allowing the Paravas to attack the Company residents at Kayalpatnam, but also giving them active support in the effort ‘moved by deception and in hopes of plunder and gain.**\n\nAnd the Portuguese struck one day on June 1648:\n\n&gt;**Thus, in June 1648 the yacht ‘Lillo’ unexpectedly arrived at Galle from Malabar with the Company residents and movable property from Kayalpatnam, ‘from where they have been expelled ignominiously by the rabble-rousing and evil practices of the Portuguese and their creatures [the Paravas]’. For a detailed account of the events, Governor Maetsuycker of Ceylon (unfortunately for us) referred to the oral report of one of the Kayalpatnam residents, the Company Merchant Cornelis van Quaalbergen, who for that purpose was specifically sent to Batavia. It is clear, however, that only the fortunate arrival of the yacht ‘Lillo’, in need for water while returning from Malabar en route to Batavia,\nsaved the local personnel from certain death. No sooner had the servants\nescaped on board the vessel than the Company factory was plundered and\ndemolished.** The total damage of the so-called ‘forced departure’ from\nKayalpatnam, including the money advanced to local merchants, painters,\nweavers, and coolies, and various unfinished textiles and commodities, was fixed at 27,888 guilders, while privately the local Company servants claimed to have lost another 884 3/5 reals or 2,123 guilders.\n\n### Sacrilegious Revenge: The Dutch Strike \n\nThe Dutch VOC were furious about what they regarded as treachery from the Madurai *aranmanai* and were aching for revenge, along with a hefty compensation for what they considered wrongful losses. In doing so, they first sought approval from their headquarters at Batavia (Jakarta) in the East Indies:\n\n&gt;**Thirsty for revenge and eager to jump on the opportunity for personal material gain, Governor Maetsuycker of Ceylon pointed to the need for a\nspeedy and adequate response, fearing for the decline of the Honourable Company’s reputation and the subsequent danger posed to other Dutch factories in the region. Despite his zeal to exact retribution, Maetsuycker still had some of his priorities straight.** He suggested postponing the ‘punitive expedition’ to the coming season after the completion of the cinnamon harvest and elephant hunt on Ceylon when the field armies would go into winter quarters and the Company could afford to dispatch 200–250 European soldiers along with 100 or more lascorins for a period of four to six weeks. **These troops, preferably to be supplemented from Batavia, Maetsuycker deemed sufficient ‘to ransack the coast, conclude an advantageous contract with the Nayaka of Madurai, restore the Company’s reputation, and recover the damage and loss of interests incurred’.**\n\nAnd then once everything was finalised, the punitive expedition commenced on February 1649:\n\n&gt;On February 3, 1649, a fleet of ten vessels (3 flutes, 1 yacht, 1 galiot, 3 longboats or sloops, and 2 Sinhalese vessels) carrying eight companies or 436 soldiers and 170–180 lascorins set sail from Galle under the command of Governor Maetsuycker. Landing six days later, on February 9, halfway between Virapandiyapatnam and Tiruchendur, the expeditionary force quickly established a base of operation at the shore temple of Tiruchendur, 24 miles south of Tuticorin.\n\nWith the landing completed, the occupation of the famed Subramaniya Temple began. While the Dutch unlike their Portuguese were much more mercantile in their approach and generally avoided mixing business with proselytisation too much, they nonetheless viewed the local religious practices with a fair bit of suspicion and contempt, deeming them idolatorous. Such a business like approach did not mean an aversion to violence as displayed by the VOCs brutal invasion of the Spice Islands (Maluku) in 1599 where they sought to establish dominance in the nutmeg trade. While at the Temple, one of the VOC officials, Johann von der Behr, notes the acts of desecration carried out there with approval on his end:\n\n&gt;Moreover, after occupying the shore temple of Tiruchendur during the ‘punitive expedition’ in early 1649, **Von der Behr noted with abhorrence (and some fascination) the horrible, devilish stone idols of the warrior-god Murugan (Subrahmanya), and the golden and silver objects in the inner sanctum (*karppakkirukam*). While the temple was plundered (‘worinnen die Grandes gute Beute machten’), some of the stone images were mutilated by iron hammers and the temple’s *gopuram* or tower unsuccessfully put to the torch. These wanton acts of vandalism and arson, however, ‘caused damage to such an extent’, Von der Behr commented approvingly, ‘that it looked more like a pigsty than a temple’**\n\nThese shock and awe tactics resulted in some initial panic among both the Madurai *aranmanai* and the Portuguese, however the Dutch were in no mood to budge yet:\n\n&gt;**Proceeding next to Tuticorin, ‘the root of all evil’, the Dutch leadership received an *olai* from the governor of Tirunelveli, Vadamalaiyappa Pillai [the Nayaka governor of Tirunelveli] promising to restore the property lost in the attack, provided the pagoda of Tiruchendur was evacuated first.** The same day (February 11) a letter was received from Dom João Garcia Sarmento, the Portuguese captain of Tuticorin, warning the Dutch not to molest the Paravas, subjects of the king of Portugal, and hence endanger the Ten Years’ Truce. **Both epistles received a cool reception and failed to make an impression on the Dutch, bent on revenge and eager for plunder.**\n\nThe Dutch then sought to attack the initial instigators and attackers, the Portuguese, proceeding to their settlement in Tuticorin which they found mostly empty:\n\n&gt;At Tuticorin, however, it was discovered that Sarmento and most of the wealthy Portuguese had already fled to the interior along with all the Parava headmen, leaving only a few priests, some Portuguese rank and file, and the poorest inhabitants behind. **Nevertheless, on February 12, a contract was drawn up with Francisco Malhero, the new-elected captain of Tuticorin, Father António Carvalho de Mesquita, vicar of Tuticorin, Father Didaco Cardoso, rector of the College of Tuticorin, and Father João de São Joseph. This makeshift leadership of the Portuguese natio promised to cough up a fire tax of 40,000 reals or 120,000 guilders within three days.**\n\nHowever, facing Nayaka troops in the town and not receiving even close to the amount they expected, VOC troops went on a rampage in Tuticorin:\n\n&gt;Cardoso was only able to come up with 5,463 reals. Thereupon, the\ntown was ransacked by the Company soldiery with Maetsuycker and Council\nturning a blind eye (though not their hands by taking their ‘fair’ share of the loot). **With the first skirmishes erupting with Nayaka troops at Melur, a second treaty was entered into with Malhero cum sociis on February 18. Instead of payment within three days, which was recognised as being too short notice, it was agreed that the remainder of the 40,000 reals, namely, 31,000 reals, was to be paid in three months by the end of May. In return, Tuticorin would be spared from being put to the torch, except for the two houses of the Parava pattangattins, including ‘the greatest scoundrel’ Henrique da Cruz, who had visited the Nayaka court and had effectuated the expulsion of the Company from Kayalpatnam.** In case of non-payment, the Company would have recourse to the right of war.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the Nayaka court in desperation sought the mediation of its Kayalapatnam deputy, the Mudaliyar Pillai Maraikkayar, to negotiate with the Dutch to leave the Temple. Thus we see a curious situation of Muslim merchant negotiating on behalf of a regional kingdom to secure the safety of a Temple, however even with these desperate pleas, the Dutch were still after a monetary compensation they deemed fit and did not budge:\n\n&gt;On February 22, a deputation from Kayalpatnam, whose Mudaliyar Pillai\nMaraikkayar exercised certain rights over the Tiruchendur temple, intervened on behalf of the Nayaka of Madurai. **The Kayalpatnam delegates promised the restitution of the stolen commodities and the building of a new Company lodge, provided the pagoda was evacuated beforehand ‘since the entire country was saddened about its occupation and many people had neither eaten nor drunk since the day we had occupied it’. However, Governor Maetsuycker and the other leaders of the expedition replied that ‘this was not the song to which the bride would dance’. Demanding 100,000 reals for damages and expenses incurred, they insisted on a speedy payment,** ‘so that the poor people would eat again and be rid of us.\'\n\nFrustrated with the stalled negotiations, the Nayakas decided to strike back, but to no avail, only losing men and further enraging the Dutch who caused considerable further damage to the Temple and its surroundings:\n\n&gt;**In a surprise attack against Melur on February 25 following the breakdown of negotiations, 40 to 50 Nayaka soldiers were killed, and the local houses and pagodas put to the torch.** As De Vogel observed in a self-congratulatory manner: ‘This harsh wake-up call will not be lost on the enemy and will cause no little alarm across the entire country. We trust they will already have lost their desire somewhat to provoke the Dutch arms so boldly.\n\nFeeling satisfied with what they deemed a stern lesson to the local rulers, the Dutch decided that they would given certain conditions be satisfied:\n\n&gt;**Sharing the opinion of his secretary, Maetsuycker pontifically declared the expedition a success and on February 28 dispatched an *olai* to Tirumalai Nayaka. In it, the Ceylon governor defended the Company’s recent actions and expressed his willingness to evacuate the Tiruchendur pagoda and reestablish a trading factory in the Madurai lands on the payment of ‘all reasonable satisfaction and contentment’.** The next day, Maetsuycker and part of the expeditionary force left the Madurai Coast allegedly, according to Portuguese reports, with 20 thonis, 4 sloops, and 2 ships filled with booty.\n\nWith the Madurai *aranmanai* finding these terms to be humiliating, they were not settling with these terms. The Dutch though decided to leave with a parting shot that was to cause the most heartache among the believers, in that took away with them among other sacred items, the *mulamurti* of Lord Murugan from the Temple as ransom:\n\n&gt;Despite its commitments in the north, the aranmanai obviously was in no\nmood to settle on these terms. Beginning on March 8, for more than two weeks daily skirmishes took place between the remaining Company force (including Von der Behr) and the Nayaka troops around the Tiruchendur pagoda. **Two days later, on March 25, the remaining Company\nforces were shipped back to Ceylon, taking with them some stone images\n(*mula murtti* or permanent immovable stone images), including that of the warrior-god Murugan (Subrahmanya), from the temple’s main shrine as\nsecurity for the amounts due to them**\n\n### From Bargaining Chip to Liability\n\nWith the *mulamurti* now taken, there were frantic attempts for its retrieval. In the meanwhile the now desolate Temple wore a deserted look:\n\n&gt;... the Dutch Reformed Batavian Councillors, who believed the return of the images to be ‘a matter touching the conscience to the utmost’ as it would **‘double the idolatry of those blind people, while the said pagoda of Tiruchendur nowadays stands deserted and is visited by nobody’.**\n\nNonetheless, the Dutch who were saw in the murti a lucrative ransom were soon to be disappointed, despite vigorous attempts by Madurai for retrieval:\n\n&gt;The third and last loose end of the ‘punitive expedition’ was the issue of the payment of 100,000 reals by the aranmanai and/or the local temple priests associated with the restitution of a group of images taken from the Tiruchendur pagoda, including the ‘stone idol’ or mula murtti of Murugan (Subrahmanya). It was rumoured that upon its restitution the ‘Gentiles’ were willing to pay the image’s weight (about 200 pounds) in gold, ‘because of its age and the many miracles it had performed\'.\n\nDelegations were soon sent, interestingly of mixed faith, to retrieve the *murti* back to its rightful place:\n\n&gt;Indeed, **in January 1650, during the Groes-Eggers mission, a mixed Muslim-Hindu delegation sent by the chiefs (the Mudaliyar Pillai Maraikkayar and *ambalakkarars*) of Kayalpatnam appeared before the Dutch envoys with an olai to Van der Meijden, asking for the restitution of ‘Lord Subrahmanya’ (Subrahmanya Cuvami) of Tiruchendur.** These Kayalpatnam representatives were subsequently provided with safe conducts in order to travel to Negombo and Galle.\n\nInterestingly, in the meanwhile the ruler of Venad (what would grow to become Travancore), also expressed interest in the possibly taking back the *murti* to his kingdom, though it is not clear from this account:\n\n&gt;In early 1650, the annual ships sent by the Company from Batavia to the Malabar Coast (the so-called Malabarvaerders) visited the raja of Travancore Ravi Varma VI (r. 1610– 1662). **Upon departure from Travancore in March 1650, the Venad ruler—who may have visited Tiruchendur during his pilgrimage to Rameswaram in 1620— secretly expressed his interest in the idol of Subrahmanya taken from the Tiruchendur pagoda to Senior Merchant Dirck Schoorl. Knowing, however, that his superiors had other, potentially more lucrative plans for the image, Schoorl politely turned down the offer.**\n\nNevertheless, negotiations reached an impasse and keeping the *murti* increasingly became something of a liability, so much so that some of the more religiously minded Dutch Reformed Church ministers in the VOC questioned why were they even keeping this \"stone image\" with them. However, ultimately commerce seems to have trumped religion and it was decided to keep the *murti* as a bargaining chip given its value to the people of the region:\n\n&gt;By this time, Van Kittensteijn already had serious doubts whether the full payment of 100,000 reals would ever be obtained and asked for instructions from Batavia as to what to do if only partial satisfaction were offered in order to re-establish trade in the Nayaka lands. **Moreover, he also raised some ethical questions regarding the restitution of the stone image to the ‘Gentiles’, though wishfully concluding nevertheless that ‘considering how much these blinded heathens value this image, something beneficial may be obtained by the\nCompany’.**\n\nHowever all this still did not result in an impasse with the VOC increasingly getting frustrated with lack of valuable trade with the region, and hence we see a climb down of sorts, though attempts at a settlement are scuttled by the old familiar Portuguese-Parava combine:\n\n&gt;These Protestant ethicoreligious reservations notwithstanding, **Mammon prevailed over God and Van Kittensteijn was authorised to sell the ‘stone idol and its dependencies’ for the price that could be agreed upon, along with a contract establishing a free and unlimited trade in the Madurai lands. Despite the easing of the sale conditions, buyers for the Tiruchendur images were now hard to find.**... **In early March of 1651, however, Van der Meijden unexpectedly returned to Galle with the images, a mere 1,577 parra or 37,848 pounds of nel, and no recompense from the Nayaka authorities. According to Van der Meijden, the common people had professed ‘teary-eyed,** that they were willing to satisfy the Company demands and that they had but one wish, that is, to live under Company jurisdiction’. **Indeed, the failure of his mission was blamed solely on the provocations of the Paravas and the Portuguese.** ... Having been informed of its outcome, **Batavia reacted somewhat cynical and acquiescent to the news of the abortive mission. Observing that Van der Meijden had not succeeded in finding any buyers for ‘the big idol of Tiruchendur’, the High Government wryly commented that ‘apparently the initial zeal has already cooled down’.**\n\n### Divine Retrieval: God Arrives in a Dream\n\nHowever, the retrieval of the Murti remained a matter of honour and prestige for the Nayakas, and especially their Tirunelveli governor Vadamalaiyappa Pillai, who:\n\n&gt;along with the Kayalpatnam Mudaliyar Pillai Maraikkayar and the stalattars of the Tiruchendur pagoda. The Tirunelveli\ngovernor descended from a family belonging to the Karkattar sect of Vellalas from Kavanur, a small village near Tirupparamkunram, a famous hinterland hill shrine and one of three famous South Indian shrines dedicated to Subrahmanya, along with Palani and the shore temple of Tiruchendur.\n\nCuriously enough Dutch sources are silent about the ultimate fate of the *murti*, with us getting supplied about its subsequent antecedents by epigraphic evidence from the Temple itself and somewhat contemporaneous folk narratives:\n\n&gt;While the Company records are silent on the ultimate fate of the Tiruchendur images, **an inscription in the *mandapam* or ceremonial hall at Tiruchendur dated 1653 (Kollam Age 829) states that both Tirumalai Nayaka and Vadamalaiyappa Pillai were present for the worship of Lord Murugan (Subrahmanya) in order to celebrate the installation and subsequent ‘revivification’ of the recovered image of Tiruchendur as part of the special renewal ceremonies known as *samprokshanam*.**\n\nFurther a traditional narrative in the form of the *sthalapuranam* of the Temple by Venrimalai Kavirayar (1624–1682), a Mukkani priest of the Temple, provides us the famous legend of its retrieval from a dream of Vadamalaiyappa\'s:\n\n&gt;About three hundred years ago a race of sea-faring men called *Usilampadi* [*lampati*, ‘wandering caste’?] descended on the place and took away the temple idol, thinking it was made of gold. Vadamalaiyappa Pillaiyan, the local renter of the Nayaka ruler, acting under the advice conveyed to him in a dream by the God [Subrahmanya], put out to sea and following His instructions recovered the image. In memory of this deed the Vadamalaiyappa mantapam [pillared outdoor hall or pavilion], to which the God is taken in times of festival, was erected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, in this tale of desecration and ultimately renewal, we see a complex interplay of actors, unexpected pairings and an intensively competitive to the point of violence trading world along the fisheries coast, whose pearls are where it all began. \n\n### Source\n\n* Markus PM Vink, *Encounters on the Opposite Coast: The Dutch East India Company and the Nayaka State of Madurai in the Seventeenth Century* (2016)', 'indian_kulcha', 'IndianHistory', 'https://reddit.com/r/IndianHistory/comments/1o2bn6b/when_the_dutch_occupied_the_abode_of_lord_murugan/', 181, 0, '2025-10-09 23:07:20', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

In Sept ’24 I survived a “sudden cardiac arrest” and was clinically dead for 10 min or so (no one knows how long). After physical and cognitive rehab, I started jogging again in March, in June started thinking about the Hartford Half, and in late August—after doing a 13 mi run—changed my mind to the full. I had a less structured training than ’08 and went to have fun. And… I had a blast, and met all my goals.\n\nHatford Marathon, 10/11/2025\n\n[https://www.hartfordmarathon.com/eversource-hartford-marathon/](https://www.hartfordmarathon.com/eversource-hartford-marathon/)\n\nGoals:\n\n1.

I turned 40 earlier that year and he was doing triathlons and Ironmans and encouraged me to give it a shot. The only running I did prior was cross country in high school. In my HS cross country was a varsity sport, but I definitely wasn’t a varsity runner. I vaguely recall 7:20 being my best mile in a 5K race.\n\nAnyway, during summer of ’08 I closely followed a 3-month 5K to marathon training regimen and signed up for Hartford. My goal in ’08 was sub 4 and I beat that with a time 3:51:57  after hitting the wall hard at mile 21.\n\nI was done with distance running. My exercise became more load bearing, short jogs, long walks, skiing, hiking, etc.\n\nThen last Sept (2024) I suffered a sudden cardiac arrest during a morning walk before work. I was clinically dead for 10 min or so due to what the cardiologist called “an electrical glitch”. I was in a coma for several days, needed physical and cognitive rehabilitation…. the whole 9 yards before being discharged home all confused because I had no memory of the event so couldn’t understand why I needed so much treatment and recovery.\n\nNew lease on life? New perspective? Yes to both.\n\nI started jogging in March of this year and in June or so thought a half marathon 55 weeks after being clinically dead would be effin’ epic. So I worked on that. Training was hard because of trips planned and heat. My weekly miles were in the low 20s. Then in late August I did a 13 mile training run. I decided to screw the half… I’m going to try a full.\n\nI also focused on injury free running. In ’08 I had partially torn both achilles, pulled (partial tear never confirmed) a hamstring tendon, and something was up with the outside of my opposite side hip. I know I was a “heel first” runner, so practiced a mid-foot strike and landing under my center of mass. This took a lot of miles. But it became second nature.\n\nI did have a hiccup with numbness when I run, but stretching my arches and feet helped a lot.\n\nStarting in late Aug/early Sept I increased weekly miles to 30s for a couple weeks and topped out at 48.  I focused on hydration and nutrition, since I remembered hitting the wall in ’08 was due to dehydration and not enough calories/carbs. I took days off if I felt sore. I foam rolled and stretched like it was my religion.\n\nIn mid Sept I did a 15-mile long run, followed by a 20 the following week. I signed up for the Hartford marathon and did another 20 miler the week after. I felt confident because I felt fine after these: after getting home and cleaning up, I could do a trip to Costco and/or mow the lawn that day or next day.\n\nI did a “balanced carb load” starting Wed pm before the marathon (event was on Sat) by eating lean protein (chicken, fish) and lots of healthy carbs (rice, sweet potatoes, etc.). I drank more fluids and liquid carbs.\n\nSince I trained with a Camelback water bladder, I did the marathon with it (key difference from ’08, when I trained with it but didn’t marathon with it). I had a system during my training runs: 4 long pulls every mile, and 2 every half mile starting at mile 4 or 5. I dialed in the energy gel (GU Rocktane) to be one every 30 min starting at 45-60 min into the run. It didn’t occur to me to use UCan since they’ll be at the event, but hindsight is 20:20.\n\nMy hydration plan was to run with the Camelback, and since it lasts me 13-15 miles I was going to alternate with the water stations. I knew to not change anything on race day, so used the Rocktane gels.\n\nResult: I kicked ass. I wouldn’t consider my ’08 marathon to be fun in any way. This one was SO MUCH FUN! I embraced the crowds and made it sort of an interactive experience: if there was a lull in cheering, I’d cup my ear with my hand and yell “I can’t hear you!” and they’d start cheering.\n\nThe crowds die down at Founder’s Bridge, so that was a drag. And the long “out and back” seems poorly planned to me. Boring. And, it’s so demoralizing seeing people coming toward you after the turn around… I totally forgot the mile marker for the turn and kept thinking it was just ahead. However, seeing my wife and son at mile 17ish was big lift.\n\nThere were pockets of crowds, and again I’d encourage cheering. I’d yell “what about me!?” to groups holding signs for a particular person and they’d cheer.\n\nI was sure to say thanks to volunteers as I passed them, and same with the police officers and people at the hydration stations.\n\nLike I said: Goal #1 was to have fun. I was celebrating my life. And I milked every ounce of fun out of that race.\n\nComing off the “out and back” and approaching Founders Bridge also required digging deep. The inclines are just enough to feel, with limited downhill relief like the first 8 miles in the city.\n\nMy plan in advance was to try to not walk before 20 miles, since 20 was my longest training distance and included some walks. I made that goal and was prepared to walk/run after that. However, I decided to go for it and run the whole thing. At mile 23 I had to really dig deep to meet this mid-race change in plan. It occurred to me that the good samaritan who called 911 last September, the paramedics, the doctors, and my family and friends never took a break in their support of me, so I wasn’t going to either.\n\nAnd...\n\nI did it. Admittedly, I stopped for a 30-sec (exactly) pee break, and quick 10-sec pause for high fives and quick hugs with my family. I’m not counting them as walking or taking a break (especially since I had to hold that pee for 4 miles until I found a portapotty without a line).\n\nIn ’08 I was physically miserable the rest of the day and weekend. This time I just feel like I did a hard leg day and lower back day at the gym. Sure, I had the post run beer, and had a nap after cleaning up. But I felt well enough to go out for dinner and the next day mowed the lawn.\n\nIn leu of a strict training plan like before, I loosely followed some 8-week training guides, followed my intuition (take a day off if something needs to heal/needs rest), and focused on hydration, nutrition, and stretching. And, wanted to have fun. The plan worked for me.\n\nDead to marathon in 55 weeks. I feel like a rockstar.\n\nI might take advantage of the early pricing and sign up for next year.\n\nHere’s an overview of the course:\n\nMiles 0 - 8: FUN! Hartford draws in the crowds. The rolling hills were nothing compared to my training runs and the downhills were perfect. I felt like I trained well.\n\nMiles 9 - turn around: sudden transition from in the city in regards to crowds, interesting scenery, and OMG: people coming back from the turn around is just demoralizing. There were some great bands, which was fun. I crushed my 13.1 training time and both my 20-mile training run times. Reading texts from family and friends on my watch and a quick hug/high five from wife and son at mile 17ish were a great pick me up.\n\nNote: something was up with the timing around mile 21, I don’t accept that it took me 38 or so minutes to go two miles, from 19 to 21.\n\nTurn around - Founders Bridge: the long straight is a nice way to make up some time, and had I planned on it I probably could have. But I was distracted by the timing issue I mentioned above. I did finally remember to mentally “reset” and focus on cadence, hydration, and energy gels and pushed through ok.\n\nFounders Bridge: the approach, starting at mile 24.5 or so had some hills that were just steep enough to be a pain in the ass, but with limited downhill refreshers. Ugh! But… I didn’t hit the wall. I knew I could do this and dug deep and I knew I was going to finish. All but 2 of my training runs ended with a mile long uphill, so this sort of felt familiar.\n\nComing off the bridge is another hill just long and steep enough to hurt; which, as I mentioned above is exactly how most of my training runs finished. So it was familiar. And the crowds come back. I cupped my hand to my ear and yelled “I can’t hear you!” and they’d cheer.\n\nThe left turn to Bushnell Park: I dreamed about that turn and how much I’d appreciate it. It didn’t let me down: the crowds were awesome. I swooped my hands up to encourage more cheers and loved how the crowd responded. Seeing that arch, hearing the crowds, the announcer calling out my name. Holy shit, it was an amazing experience.\n\nI literally went from clinically dead to marathon in 55 weeks. I don’t know if I was trying to prove something or take something back. Or both. But I did it. Without walking.\n\nTwo things race planners should change: that goddamned out and back, and make the arch the actual finish line.\n\nCheers.', 'Skier-Dude', 'Marathon_Training', 'https://reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1o5kbdg/hartford_marathon_2025_from_dead_to_marathon_in/', 10, 13, '2025-10-13 19:52:59', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

These technologies and practices are so ingrained in our food culture we never even give them a second thought. But they changed not only bread but human nutrition as a whole, across the globe. I\'ll look at the following in particular:\n\n- Roller milling\n\n- The Green Revolution\n\n- Chorleywood process \n\nThis is a story about our relationship with technology and how we reconcile progress with harm. No-one consulted your parents &amp; ancestors, as a consumers of bread, when these huge changes were made to their staple food. Nor were they fully informed of their downsides. The changes crept up on them &amp; they often welcomed them too - under their beliefs at the time, this was progress. Even when the negative consequences became clear, technological changes were never quite rolled back. \n\nBut while technology is useful, it is not totally benign and it should never be above challenge. Often our technological capabilities exceed our real understanding of their consequences. It\'s a theme that plagued food &amp; consumer products since the Industrial Revolution - we put something out there in the hands of people and then we realise - *ohhh shit! - it\'s problematic*. After a brief period of backlash and lawsuits, we quickly get back to assuming the world is safe. \n\nMy crystal ball says there\'ll be plenty more *ohhh shit! - it\'s problematic!* moments in the future. And more reasonable backlash steamrolled over, in the name of progress (and money making). \n\n**********\n\nROLLER MILLING\n\n...or the moment snow-white flour became a thing. \n\nThis is arguably the most consequential change in global nutrition, yet it\'s so far removed from living memory, that hardly anyone talks about it nowadays. Invented in 1870s, roller mills revolutionised milling (of wheat as well as other grains such as rice), baking &amp; food in general and brought about more malnutrition &amp; disease than ever. It also brought about mandatory fortification of flour in many countries. \n\nWeston Prince, in his book about remote populations,  often compares the modern world with roller mills vs traditional world with no roller mills, half a century after the technology was widely adopted. And the differences were stark. The Swiss, Scotish &amp; Pacific Island stories are particularly relevant - the moment the local shop starts stocking white flour &amp; sugar, traditional foods are abandoned and health of the population goes down. He specifically mentions the \'town Swiss\' love for newly brought in baked goods and sweets. \n\n\n*How did the evil roller mills do it? And why do we still  use them to this day?*\n\nBefore roller mills, stoneground flour was perishable. The fact that the wheat germ, containing oil, could not be trully sieved out before imbibing the endosperm (the white part of the wheat) meant that flour had a shelf life as it went rancid. Stonegrinding was more difficult, more bound to location (next to  river!) and sieving took work and energy. The flour was darker in colour, due to the germ and leftover bran. It also had a ton of nutrients - a lot of the B vitamins, vitamin E, magnesium, zinc, potassium and a bunch of other minerals. \n\nAnd people were eating around a pound of the stuff *every single day* in Europe, North America &amp; parts of the Middle East. Bread was often considered a meal in itself and it was often the main thing on the table for the poor. If it was not made of wheat, it would have been made of rye, barley or oats or a combination of them all. And all that nutrition from staple grain sources served them really well, health wise. \n\nRoller milling resolved all the problems of stonegrinding, but unfortunatelly it did so by removing all the nutrition from the grain. While also producing flour previously associated with being rich - white flour. Rather than crushing the entire grain at once like stones, rollers first separate the bran &amp; the germ from the endosperm completely, then crush just the endosperm to make flour. The grain can be cleaned beforehand as well and mechanical sifting can be done with ease. \n\nNo germ milled meant no oil and no rancidity and therefore a product that was shelf stable for years. And  due to its white colour, it happened to be considered a premium. Suddently, you could bring flour to every single corner of the world that grew no wheat &amp; never seen a mill before and market it as a luxury yet affordabe product. And make a sh*t ton of money in the process. Mechanising agriculture in the vast plains of North America also meant a huge amount of quality, high protein milling wheat could be produced and exported. \n\nEven places that did not eat wheat, now got hooked on white flour, white bread and pastry. Most of the pastry products we eat nowadays were probably invented around this time as well. Having all of that while also having a decent amount of highly nutritious food is not that bad for you. However, the moment those those \'highly nutritious\' elements of the diet are dropped, either by choice or due to poverty, malnutrition and its consequences seep in.\n\nThis was made clear by the Great Depression, when poor people, who were relying on bread for survival, fell sick with all manner of malnutrition related diseases - pelagra, beri beri, etc. The backlash against roller mills was spearheaded by medical practitioners and their associations who saw this every day with their patients. \n\nGovernments had to step in, but instead of assessing the harm done by roller milling, they decided to fortify the flour instead, with all the nutrients stripped out of the grain in the first place. Problem partially solved (plastered over), progress must march on! \n\n\n*If roller mills are designed to produce white flour, how do we get our modern \'wholewheat\' flour, roller milled, not stone-ground?*\n\nWell, we\'re faking it, really. \n\nRoller mills first separate endosperm, bran and germ and then mill / process each one of them in separate streams (multiple-stream milling). Then the components, after being separatelly processed, are recombined into \'wholewheat\' flour.\n\nThis process still needs to adress germ\'s ability to make the flour go rancid. After all, the wholewheat flour you buy needs to last many months on supermarket shelves. So the germ is either removed all together (*there are few rules on what should be put back into this reconstituted wholewheat flour*) or purified / heat treated to remove the oils from it. \n\nNutritionally, the heat treatment destroys some of the vitamins, most of which are in the germ. But minerals are still there, and there\'s more fibre overall. However, that fibre comes with phytates, which interfere with the absorbtion of said minerals. \n\nIf you are going to use roller milled wholewheat flour in baking, you\'d probably want to long ferment it, to get rid of the phytates. If the germ is actually removed rather than heat treated and put back in - I\'d say this flour is nutritionally pointless and there\'s better things out there to get your fibre from. But you\'ll never know whether the germ is in there or not!\n\nIf you are *buying* so called \'wholewheat\' bread in the shops, bear in mind it only has about 20-30% roller milled wholewheat flour in it, or else it would be too dense and unappealing to sell. Supermarket breads (and most bakery shop bread!) will *not* be long fermented. So you have a bread incorporating max 30% of a flour that *may have* some nutritional benefits, produced in a way that makes those benefits unavailable. The only upside here is a tiny bit of fibre. I would personally eat another apple for fibre and not bother! \n\nIf you are *buying* stoneground wholewheat flour, remember the stone miller has the same rancidity problem to resolve and there is no regulation saying stoneground flour should only be ground by stones and not heat or enzyme treated. So you may be coming against different problems (enzymes!) in your quest for genuinely nutritious flour. \n\nUnfortunatelly, nothing on the market matches the fresh, stone ground, high extraction flour your great-great-great grandad was eating in the 1850s. If you want real whole grains in your life - make some whole wheat berry porridge, get a cereal flaker or if baking is your thing, get a kitchen mill. \n', 'Extension_Band_8138', 'PlasticObesity', 'https://reddit.com/r/PlasticObesity/comments/1oe44ot/the_story_of_bread_2_the_price_of_progress_roller/', 3, 11, '2025-10-23 20:03:54', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Some interesting twists this season, some likeable teams and some competitive enough moments and teams…but still feels a bit hollow and boring compared to classic seasons.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTheme\n\n\\- This season is called “The Season of Surprises” which means there is 1 twist each leg - some of them are previous twists such as the Intersection and Head to Head, while some are new such as the Fork in the Road and Driver’s Seat. I mostly enjoyed the twists and this was a great theme! None of them ruined the episodes - they either added some intrigue like the U-Turn vote and Driver’s Seat (positive) or contributed nothing like the Valet Roulette or Fast Forward (didn’t add anything but weren’t negatives). 90 minute episodes can feel drawn out so adding a twist per episode was a great idea! I actually think this season was better because of these twists, and is a big reason I ranked it higher than TAR35 which was mostly uneventful.\n\n\\- But I’ll go through each twist individually. The Fork in the Road was fine - I would’ve preferred it for more than 1 challenge but I liked some of the strategy in choosing which path (pick the easier challenge, the route with less teams so far, or the route with weaker teams?). The Intersection was also fine - I would’ve preferred it later in the race though (in leg 2 we don’t really care that Scott and Bernie or Jeff and Courtney are working together - in a later episode it would feel more impactful to see different teams working together). The Express Pass challenges are good - I would like the element of giving away Express Passes brought back somehow too. The Driver’s Seat is fantastic and I’d like to see it introduced permanently and preferably 2 per season. The U-Turn vote (and it being live) and traditional U-Turns are great (love the drama). Fast Forwards are good although not implemented well here - they need to either be a difficult challenge (eg. head shave, eating, heights) or an opportunity for a 1 vs 1 (like TAR25’s surfing) and it was basically guaranteed whichever team found the sports car first gets it without opposition. The Head to Head was fine and much better than having it directly before the pit stop. The Scramble is okay in the finale but didn’t work because every team did the challenges in the same order (but it doesn’t hurt the episode). The Valet Roulette was the most pointless but isn’t a negative. And finally the non-elimination was a bit of a letdown being used as one of the twists - I would’ve liked bringing back losing your possessions (not money though because begging is a bit icky nowadays) or a Speed Bump.  \n\n\\- If I were to add in some more twists, I would have included a Yield. Maybe teams have to find an hourglass (a 10 minute or a 20 minute like TAR32). I honestly wouldn’t be opposed to a Yield every leg like TAR32. And instead of 2 Express Passes, I think they could have brought back The Save for 1 of them (complete an extra challenge to win The Save). The Save could either create the non-elimination or create the first ever final 2 (if not used). I also think maybe reworking The Hazard - rather than just being 1 additional challenge for failing something, make it a penalty like Amazing Race Australia (can’t speak for the leg, have to carry something for the leg, can’t ask for directions, lose possessions etc). And moving forward I think a twist each leg should become the norm. I don’t even mind if they have 2 twists in 1 leg (for example a Head to Head and an Express Pass challenge can be in the same leg). I think they could have even more twists with 90 minute episodes - 2 Driver’s Seats per season, 2 Intersections/Fast Forwards/Head to Heads per season, 1 U-Turn vote plus 2 traditional U-Turns, etc. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGeneral Thoughts\n\n\\- I still found this season dull compared to many classic seasons! More “good episodes” than TAR33-TAR36 although also many boring ones. 90 minute episodes again which can also drag when casts aren’t that interesting. And unfortunately I have to say this is one of the dullest casts ever, down there with TAR34 and TAR35. Jonathan/Ana’s rocky relationship provided some interesting old school negativity and the season would have felt very hollow without them. The final 3 weren’t too boring (the other teams in the final 6 were duller) which helped and there were a lot of likeable teams overall. They also felt less gimmicky and easier to support - no celebrities, nobody who danced with Pitbull, no teams with inspirational backstories, and less teams defined just by their profession (I guess maybe Mark/Brett being Vegas Performers or Pops/Jeff being Lumberjacks but a lot of teams were just regular friends or siblings which was refreshing). A few older contestants and less younger couples was nice (although many of the older teams went early). It’s also the largest cast ever at 14 teams and the first few episodes don’t work as well with so many teams to follow.\n\n\\- There’s still a lack of inter-teams dynamics which is common in the new era. A lot of robotic challenge scenes with teams just “doing the challenge” with no storylines or substance (and airport scenes were weak - teams were just directed to a travel agent. One team even went to the wrong travel agent so that proves they don’t really have freedom with flights). The U-Turn vote brought some intriguing drama but no ongoing storylines. One example is Jonathan/Ana feeling betrayed by Carson/Jack with their U-Turn vote…but that’s never mentioned again despite both teams making the final 3. Pops/Jeff and Melinda/Erika also make a parents alliance which seemed endearing but also didn’t lead anywhere. I just wish they would stop the robotic racing and have a few confessionals where teams are commenting on one another or show teams socialising or gossiping at airports. The only interesting dynamic was Ana dealing with Jonathan’s rudeness and mood swings. Maybe a bit more friction than some of the Covid seasons with teams like Han/Holden, Nick/Mike and Bernie/Carrigain showing some minor bickering.\n\n\\- One thing that stood out this season was the effort in showing off the locations and experiences positively. A lot of things were hyped up by Phil and the contestants “OMG the Japanese drumming was so great, OMG the bullet train was so great”, “OMG the ATV in Bali was so great”, “OMG the camels and bedouins were so great”, “OMG the medieval archery was so great” and even things like “OMG first time in Naples” and “OMG a self drive” and “OMG that ritual was so great” (even when the ritual just looked “okay”, no offence haha). This has been a thing in the last few seasons, with the Expedia experiences, but felt more obvious this season. It’s not a bad thing but I secretly miss the days when a team called Stonehenge “just a pile of rocks”, or were underwhelmed with the Berlin Wall, or even complained about poverty or being scammed (the negative sides of travel are basically non-existent now). It’s nice seeing teams enjoying the race, but I also like gritty and realistic travel experiences.\n\n\\- Carson/Jack were likeable and deserving winners…although felt like they had the same edit as the last few winners (Kim/Penn, Derek/Claire, Greg/John, Ricky/Cesar). No negative qualities, competent racers, respectful, a little dorky at times etc. I feel like Carson/Jack were more interesting than Greg/John and Ricky/Cesar, and didn’t dominate as much (their win wasn’t as predictable but still felt a bit predictable based on the edits). Overall they were probably the best outcome but a Han/Holden underdog win would have been a unique ending (or a team like Melinda/Erika somehow getting to the end and pulling off a win). It was a satisfying ending but felt a bit standard.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nRoute   \n\n\\- The route was okay but still bottom half compared to previous seasons because it only had Asia and Europe. Very visually appealing route, a new country in Bulgaria (1 new country 37 seasons in is fine), but a lot of the legs feel like “been there done that” - Dubai, Hong Kong and Bali are overused, and even the less visited regions in Osaka, Kyoto, Naples, Strasbourg and Porto feel generic although mostly nice places. China and Japan feel similar as well as most of the European legs feel similar. Dubai is one of the most overused cities but still good to visit the Middle East. The Los Angeles start was generic (if they start in Los Angeles I feel like it needs to be an iconic Hollywood sign type start) but Miami felt diverse as the Miami Beach area hasn’t been utilised in previous Miami visits. But feels like a good route if you haven’t seen the first 30 seasons.\n\n\\- The 90 minute episodes meant challenges got more airtime so it was more important to make them diverse and interesting again. Unfortunately they weren’t again haha Most of them were challenging enough (more complex than many earlier seasons) but felt boring to watch. Things like the Japanese drumming, the dance challenges and fixing the sumo costume were “difficult” but they felt so long and repetitive - we saw so many attempts, some struggles, some passing, repeat, repeat, repeat. There were some exciting placement shifts but teams were mostly dull so it didn’t feel captivating to watch EVERY SINGLE team’s failed attempts. With a more interesting cast, the challenges would have looked better though. Charla/Mirna made some very terrible challenges interesting, for example Charla/Mirna climbing a bamboo tower was better than any TAR37 team climbing the bun tower, and Charla in armor is better than Carson/Jack geeking out in the armor.\n\n\\- A lot of challenges also felt very boring and were just making/doing something (although once again Charla/Mirna making noodles was hilarious while that challenge would have been dead boring with this cast) - we had delivering heavy things that “weren’t heavy enough to cause serious drama”, making things like origami cranes and stork nests were difficult but still teams were mostly boring, putting things in the correct places like the fruits and the coral is also boring, making food items like pizzas and mozzarella, threshing rice, milking sheep, washing laundry, and these all just feel so boring. The only ones that stood out were the hay because of Nick/Mike, deciphering the bible verse in the library (there were actually 2 challenges in bookstores in Bulgaria though), and maybe the water jousting felt a bit different. There were 3 surfing type challenges and 2 weapons challenges (with the ninja weapons being very difficult and arguably unfair).\n\n\\- I’ve already mentioned all the twists earlier because they were the theme of the season. They either made the episode more interesting or were “better than nothing”. None of them ruined the episodes. We still technically have never had a season with truly “no non-eliminations” because they add in 1 Keep on Racing, megaleg or “a surprise non-elimination”. I personally prefer 11 teams with 3 non-eliminations (larger casts feel more cluttered plus a team doesn’t feel completely “doomed” when it’s definitely elimination) but if they have a larger cast, they should try sticking fully to no non-eliminations…because it’s just unnecessarily annoying each season haha\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCast Ranking\n\n1.Jonathan/Ana - I love complexity and these 2 got fans talking the most! They had previously separated but said that watching The Amazing Race helped them get back together. Bickering couples over “boring and positive” any day! Jonathan was occasionally moody, sarcastic, overly competitive (frustrated with 2nd place one leg), rudely blamed Ana in challenges, and once called her a terrible partner. Ana was super sweet and took this abuse, for example supporting Jonathan through his heat exhaustion despite him being tough on her. But their edit was a bit all over the place - Jonathan was actually supportive a lot of the time (like when Ana struggled in the finale - possibly redemption ending for Jonathan) and Ana called Jonathan the perfect partner during her ectopic pregnancy. Jonathan got a lot of hate from fans but he wasn’t as abusive as some of the classic teams (for example original TAR6 Jonathan). They were the arrogant threatening team at the start and a target for the U-Turn, then a bit more dysfunctional later on. But most intriguing!\n\n2. Carson/Jack - more likeable, maybe even funnier than Jonathan/Ana, but “the gamers” were more 1 dimensional. But still brought some fun energy! They were classic nerds and compared A LOT of things to their video games and nerd stereotypes, “I used to pick the flowers instead of playing soccer” and “I read an origami book at the library instead of hanging out with jocks”, and when they separated from Han/Holden they compared it to Lord of the Rings “goodbye fellowship” haha. Some of it felt forced (comparing the ATV course to Mariokart was a bit cringe haha), but I still can’t help but like them. They were fans, Jack was unemployed, some strategy and talking about minimising their threat level, an impressive comeback when falling 3 hours behind and a sense of humor (when Jack was closeted he met Carson who was dancing to Lady Gaga…and only a gay person would know that choreography haha). Good racers, their “pool noodle arms” still got them through physical challenges and always respectful.\n\n3. Han/Holden - they weren’t the biggest characters ever but I really enjoyed watching them. They were likeable, a few bickering moments (that didn’t feel mean spirited), and were somewhat underdogs with a few blunders compared to the other teams at the end. A few fun moments like talking about their parents being immigrants at the rice threshing, “they worked to get us an education so we didn’t have to be rice farmers” haha, Han catching a cheeky wave on the surfboard task, “That’s my girl…and by that I mean my sister” and crushing on the chef in Dubai “I already have a boyfriend” haha They hadn’t worked together much previously, were racing for their sister with cerebral palsy and seemed fun and down to Earth (often joking with one another such as Holden joking about plagiarising Han’s work). \n\n4. Nick/Mike - I generally don’t like the young alpha male teams…but these 2 were a pleasant exception. They DID NOT dominate in a boring fashion - in fact they failed many challenges, got lost a bit and argued multiple times. They actually became an underdog team who just scraped through several times and were lucky to even make the final 7. But they were also very likeable. They had applied multiple times, were superfans and felt relatable and down to Earth. Joked around like “I touched Mike in places” when putting on the sumo outfit, “unfortunately the only time we spent in the kitchen with nonna and mom was eating and not cooking” during the food prep challenge, and Nick wearing “cool glasses” for his eye injury. They somewhat re-enacted the famous 8 hour hay bails challenge. With Carson/Jack’s miraculous come from behind, could this have been even more interesting than Lena’s failure? But I really enjoyed watching these 2.\n\n5. Scott/Lori - great early boots and a shock early elimination! Feels more interesting than the standard weaker teams leaving early (which is most early boots this season). They were very fun, enthusiastic, a strong older couple, fun comments like their “slogging” which means slow jogging, and cute moments like Lori “Oh shoot he’s got the clue” but quickly changing demeanour to “but good for him” haha Scott was a bit of a show off but still endearing. They were bitter over the U-Turn “It’s like our 8 sons voted against us” and had the “we aren’t threats, we’re old and weak” mentality (hints of Dave/Connor who were coincidently also mormons) but Scott/Lori didn’t get into the annoying territory (yet). They were similar to Jocelyn/Victor - a fun and likeable older couple who sadly left too early.\n\n6. Pops/Jeff - a very likeable and sugary sweet father/son dynamic similar to Rob/Corey. Not that interesting but you can’t help but find their bond endearing. You could tell how much Jeff admired his father, loved spending time together growing up as lumberjacks, and “When he was born I knew he’d be my friend”. Pops did very well physically (climbed the bun tower without using his legs) and Phil was crushing on Pops a few times “I want to look like that at 64” and “Pop’s arms looking great coming up there” haha. Jeff, “I’ve always called him Superman and I got to see him fly today” aww and losing out in a footrace was a sad ending for them.\n\n7. Melinda/Erika - similar to Pops/Jeff but maybe not as “sugary sweet”. I usually like the older or underdog type teams but these 2 didn’t stand out much for me, outside a few small disagreements and mistakes…although I did still like them. They did have classic Nancy/Emily vibes as they came across as just a regular down to earth mother/daughter team who just scraped by each week. I just unfortunately didn’t find them that interesting sorry. Their biggest moment was misinterpreting you “must not take taxis” to “you must take taxis”. Erika saying they’re good at reading clues right after taking a taxi haha\n\n8. Alyssa/Josiah - and another likeable team (who weren’t that interesting) but I find parent/child teams more endearing than a nice couple. They seemed so sweet and perfect so you can’t hate them…but sweet couples aren’t one of my favorite archetypes unless you’re super funny or interesting. There was just no depth or storylines from them at all. Josiah had an occasional fun moment (some pizza puns with Phil) but nothing special. He also seemed to have very over the top enthusiasm for everything and a permanent smile (normal things like the Bedouin drums were the best thing ever for him haha). Nice but not my sort of team. I did like the contrast between Alyssa/Josiah being very positive and Jonathan/Ana being very negative in the final 4. \n\n9. Bernie/Carrigain - “were like a married couple that should be divorced” and had a few arguments and filled the role of the dysfunctional girl team (similar to Morgan/Lena, Kishori/Karishma, Michelle/Victoria etc) and I like that archetype. They had the biggest fight of the season at the airport but weren’t too explosive overall. They were fine but not super memorable. Would definitely rank higher if they lasted longer and if we saw more craziness or bickering from them.\n\n10. Mark/Larry - I like the unique older teams and believe there should be more of them (2 less-fit older men aren’t that common). These 2 also would have been great if they lasted longer - “broke rednecks” who had never been outside the US and you could tell they had a good sense of humor joking about the name being “Handsome Stranger” and making fun of each other for crying. Similar to Tim/Rex or Steve/Dave (fun in their short time) or could have been a fun and relatable Bopper/Mark type team if they lasted longer. Could they have survived if it wasn’t a Fork in the Road as they were ahead of teams from the other side? Or if it weren’t a double elimination, could we have had them for longer in the race?\n\n11. Jackye/Lauren - and similar to Mark/Larry but here we have 2 older women who aren’t likely to do well but will be entertaining in their short stay. Once again I like the unique older teams even if they’re a disaster. These 2 fell behind quickly in their 1 leg. Jackye had a fear of stairs after a previous injury and had an inspirational moment when the show’s first challenge was of course stairs haha Then Lauren struggled at the bun climbing and then succeeded with inspirational music. I got the impression that their “inspirational” moments were more played as a joke because their effort felt more “pathetic” than inspirational sorry haha But still enjoyed watching them - being similar to the Gutsy Grannies is a good thing!\n\n12. Brett/Mark - felt underedited and the most irrelevant team in the final 5. Similar to Quinton/Mattie and Yvonne/Melissa in that they make it far but are very boring and we know very little about them. Their only interesting moment was confusing the Burj Khalifa with Wiz Khalifa haha They seemed nice, okay racers, but I found them very boring and forgettable, plus I’m not a fan of boring fit males.\n\n13. Courtney/Jasmin - an early boot team who were mostly behind but not really in an interesting way. They struggled to get taxis a few times, and at first it appeared that the taxis didn’t stop because they were black but it was mostly because they didn’t show the drivers the Chinese parts of the clue. But Courtney had trouble kicking in the Japanese game (with an emotional scene talking about her mother), struggled at the origami, “In the hospital someone would be dead right now” haha but were mostly just nice, not great racers and forgettable - mostly just remembered for being “the nurses”. \n\n14. Ernest/Bridget - didn’t make much of an impression. Seemed nice but only remembered for Ernest struggling at the drumming Intersection which slowed Mark down. They didn’t entertainingly struggle (like Chris/Mary or Elizabeth/Iliana) and we already had nice parent/child teams in Pops/Jeff and Erika/Melinda. They hinted at Ernest being more authoritarian previously so maybe potential for a Ron/Christina dynamic…but didn’t get anything interesting from them here.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeg Rankings\n\n1.Leg 7 - Bulgaria (F7 - Nick/Mike eliminated) - a fantastic episode and possibly the best episode of the 30s…maybe not of all time though because this is a boring cast haha. But it had the first self drive (sad that it’s hyped up) with some classic navigation dramas. The big one was Carson/Jack falling 3 hours behind…and wildly managing to catch up! (one of the best comebacks). Loved Melinda/Erika racing Nick/Mike to the U-Turn (and it appeared they put the pictures in the wrong order haha) and obviously Nick/Mike really struggling with the hay. But also had Jonathan blaming Ana for choosing the hay but then getting stuck in a ditch (Jonathan’s fault), a new country in Bulgaria (Josiah confusing Sofia, Bulgaria with Sofia Vergara haha), all teams far apart (felt old school), and the ritual being like “where the wild things are”. Milking the sheep had the 102 year old lady, Mark being strangely scared of milking, and Holden “I didn’t know where the squirt hole was coming from” with milk going everywhere haha Just a fun episode the whole way through!\n\n2. Leg 4 - Indonesia (F10 - Bernie/Carrigain eliminated) - this leg had more moments where teams weren’t just robotically doing challenges. 1 of only 2 minor flight scrambles, the Driver’s Seat had Jonathan/Ana making some questionable decisions (alienating Scott/Lori, giving Carson/Jack less weight, giving Bernie/Carrigain more weight, using the Express Pass straight after), some bitterness and discussion on who are threats, Brett/Mark coming from behind and some arguing from Bernie/Carrigain. The ATV course was okay but basically an ad with some cringy and forced confessionals like Jonathan comparing it to Indiana Jones and Carson/Jack “reliving our Mariokart fantasy”. The rice threshing was good because of the Driver’s Seat (and 49 year old Lori dominating), and both of the Detours were just “making things” but had fun moments - Jonathan wanting to go to the bathroom, funny stories to remember the fruits, Nick/Mike spilling the offering onto the judge haha, the Balinese village looked nice, and a group of teams running around looking for the pit stop. Would have been even better if Bernie/Carrigain were with them too.\n\n3. Leg 5 - Indonesia (F9 - Scott/Lori eliminated) - I loved the U-Turn vote! I’ll always be a fan of drama - Scott/Lori feeling bitter “They’re not my friends anymore” and even small ones like Jonathan/Ana feeling betrayed by Carson/Jack, and Carson/Jack commenting on their social game. Also the strategies (splitting votes, targeting threats etc). However the tasks were simple (delivering coconuts, attaching coral, finding the correct surfboard) so the U-Turned teams felt screwed, and also whoever had the Driver’s Seat in the previous leg was likely to be U-Turned here. Jonathan was a hilarious wet blanket for most of the leg - Ana tried supporting him but he snapped “Be quiet I have a headache”. Very close with Jonathan and Scott together at the surfboards with Jonathan half passed out on the board haha Carson/Jack and Mark/Brett were close for 1st “a little gay beach hanging out” haha And Lori/Scott were an interesting shock elimination. Might rank higher if there were more moments from the non U-Turned teams.\n\n4. Leg 8 - Bulgaria (F6 - Melinda/Erika eliminated) - another Carson/Jack comeback…no equalisers with a few placement shifts made the leg feel dynamic (but not as interesting as the first Bulgaria leg). Loved translating the bible verse with teams needing to turn the cypher over - Alyssa/Josiah hilariously searching the library and even climbed the ladder, Han/Holden argued over breathing haha, and some great inter-team dynamics (Jonathan helping Alyssa/Josiah, Han/Holden working with Melinda/Erika but then working with Carson/Jack when Melinda/Erika walked away, and Holden deciding to help Melinda/Erika which could have been a mistake). Finding the Klerk shop had some fun moments, some public transport navigation (Carson/Jack randomly meeting a former cluegiver on the bus haha). Finding the crucifix in the lake was very boring, and the hot coals Speed Bump was okay (Josiah hating hot things was a bit weird). Felt tense at the dance, despite knowing that Melinda/Erika were about to get a few penalties for taking taxis. \n\n5. Leg 10 - France (F5 - Brett/Mark eliminated) - a notch down from the first 4 legs which were all “very good”. Not a lot happening, mostly boring tasks, but some exciting placement shifts and many small tasks. A quick visit to Germany, probably so it could be included on the Council of Europe question (Jonathan was like “we raced in Germany?”). Jonathan was in a sour mood the entire leg (I like some negativity) - blaming Ana for the cheese and calling her a “terrible partner”. Some arguing from Han/Holden, some stress with Alyssa/Josiah deciding whether to use the Express Pass at the cheese guessing (probably waited too long to use it), the jousting Head to Head was okay, washing laundry/making the stork nest were boring but some okay moments (Carson/Jack wondering what the old ladies were gossiping about “they’re calling us handsome” haha and it was tense with Alyssa/Josiah and/Brett/Mark’s nests getting rejected and working out why). Some navigation dramas throughout and felt interesting enough despite no big moments\n\n6. Leg 12 - USA (F4 - Alyssa/Josiah eliminated and F3 - Finale) - a generally underwhelming finale! An okay first half but Carson/Jack took the lead and seemed unbeatable during the final challenge (the best finales are when teams are equal at a tough memory challenge). Alyssa/Josiah’s elimination added some excitement (maybe a strategy to make the finale better). The water challenges showed off Miami well - speedboat across Biscayne Bay, rescuing the mannequin, sailing the dinghy (which turned into teams just paddling it “the nerdiest and least cool way possible”) and the flyboard, which was the only interesting challenge (although very similar to Dubai’s electronic surfboard). The flyboard had all 3 teams together, Ana facing her fear of water (with Jonathan actually being supportive), and Jack the nerd beating Han the surfer. The final challenge wasn’t great, Carson/Jack seemed unbeatable, and Han/Holden’s accident actually put them further behind. A satisfying result, well done for filming through a flood, but pretty average!\n\n7. Leg 11 - Portugal (F4 - TBC) - feels similar to the finale (90 minutes of dull teams) but without the excitement of…the finale. It ends with a cliffhanger of Jonathan/Ana and Alyssa/Josiah at the final challenge together…with Jonathan breaking a tile. It’s fine as long as they don’t do it every season. There was also another minor cliffhanger before a commercial where Alyssa/Josiah have a car rear-end them…but nothing happens (similar to the tile cliffhanger haha). Valet Roulette is pointless, the paddle and delivering barrels was dull (some unusual bickering with Alyssa/Josiah though), the bow and arrow was dull (Carson/Jack geek out over the medieval task and Han calls Holden “Tyrion Lannister” in the armor haha “short king!”) And the tiles were okay because teams were close together from the trains. Jonathan had another negative leg and overreacted when Ana walked in front of him “Don’t cut me off, that’s rude” - they fell behind early and Jonathan was sarcastic and critical again. Felt tense at times but 90 minutes is too much for a final 4 leg.\n\n8. Leg 1 - China (F14 - Jackye/Lauren and Mark/Larry eliminated) - not that great of a premiere honestly! I did like classic elements like driving to the airport for 1 of 2 flights, the ferries (even though the equaliser felt annoying), the double elimination, the Tian Tan Buddha (Jackye facing her fear of stairs), plus premieres don’t feel as drawn out at 90 minutes. But not much interesting from the teams though - Jonathan/Ana were shown as super competitive, took an early lead and Jonathan was frustrated by the equaliser and not coming 1st. Not many other teams stood out (maybe a bit of struggle from Nick/Mike and Jackye/Lauren). Climbing the bun tower was too easy with only Lauren slightly struggling (without the rain it would have been even easier), and the lion dance/Cantonese opera both felt similar and were just a montage of teams performing, failing and sometimes succeeding. Thankfully we had the Fork in the Road or they’d be very little suspense with Jackye/Lauren falling far behind - it was actually a very close finish with Mark/Larry!\n\n9. Leg 6 - United Arab Emirates (F8 - Pops/Jeff eliminated) - mostly boring besides a fantastic ending with the close train and foot race between Pops/Jeff and Nick/Mike (with the train in front closing on Pops/Jeff). Every challenge seemed to be designed to show off Dubai rather than be interesting - riding camels was boring (of course Carson/Jack compare it to Star Wars), skydiving was boring and making the tea platter was boring (Han crushing on chef Christoffe and Holden was expecting some “super old head instead of this good looking French guy” haha). The electric surfboard was okay because many teams were there at once. Holden was a mess from saying “that’s my girl…and by that I mean my sister” to awkwardly saying “You’re in a good spot” to Nick/Mike but “No we’re tied for last”. Holden then awkwardly replied “oh…well good luck” haha Very disappointed with the Fast Forward feeling like a long commercial in the deep diving pool - the first to find the car was basically guaranteed the Fast Forward (liked Phil trying it though).\n\n10. Leg 9 - Italy (F5 - Non elimination) - this leg was pretty boring and mostly challenge-oriented. Carson/Jack mentioned having a fight the last time they went to Italy and this time “we don’t need nonnas saying shut up Americans from their windows” haha Making the mandolin/braiding mozzarella were just “generic making things” (only moment was Han/Holden thinking their mozzarellas were terrible but surprisingly getting some approved “We’re not even bad bro”), purchasing groceries in Italian also felt generic, and making the pizza was about as generic as an Italian challenge as you could get (they say “from scratch” but not really). Carson was calling himself “America’s worst cook”, Ana worked at Dominoes, the judge was scared when Alyssa put her hand in the oven, and some fun banter with the non-participants eating the failed attempts. Also a funny moment where Phil and Josiah were trying to outdo one another with pizza puns and ending with “those jokes are cheesy” haha Boring but more tasks than the ones below it.\n\n11. Leg 2 - Japan (F12 - Ernest/Bridget eliminated) - very disappointed in the 2 Japan episodes which is a shame since I love visiting Japan and Japanese culture. Both very drawn out, boring and not much interesting happened - both legs needed 1 more challenge. This one is slightly ahead because the airport scramble was okay with different flights and Bernie/Carrigan’s big argument (the only heated argument of the season). Also some placement shifts at the challenges, some stress from Han/Holden, and Ernest letting Mark down at the Intersection. But the drumming was very long and boring - it was just bang, bang, bang with sometimes passing and sometimes failing (but no interesting moments). Jack, “I imagine it to be what Scott/Lori’s home sounds like” haha Making the Mochi balls/wrapping the sumo outfit were also boring with teams just robotically doing them for a good chunk of the 90 minutes. The sumo judge was okay but it seemed pointless to push them out of the ring because it’s almost impossible to move them (from experience).\n\n12. Leg 3 - Japan (F11 - Courtney/Jasmin eliminated) - and also felt long and boring with not much happening! The fortune paper was boring (besides Courtney/Jasmin having to wet theirs again and the bus driving off), the Japanese hackysack was boring besides a few struggles (in particular Carrigan and Courtney), and Jonathan being unsupportive “I’m not going to smile when you’re having a hard time doing something so simple”, the Express Pass just being both completing the Road Block was a bit lame, and the Detour felt poorly designed - it felt unsatisfying because it came down to how quickly the teams quit the ninja weapons for the much easier origami. A bit of stress from teams at both Detours, Alyssa was surprisingly stressed, plus a scene of Nick/Mike meditating and talking about having his jaw shut for 3 months, plus helping Han/Holden. It also felt a bit silly having Ana talking about her daughter being proud of them doing origami…when they actually picked the other Detour first haha But mostly very boring!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSummary\n\nAnother dull, mostly positive post-Covid season with many drawn out 90 minute episodes…but a satisfying ending with an okay final 3, likeable teams and a twist every leg made the season “okay” - the twists and some slight drama/negativity puts it a step above TAR35 which also had no big moments and had one of the dullest casts. It was more satisfying than TAR32 and TAR16 (also dull casts that I gave a 5) but just behind TAR19 (a similar positive cast but slightly more interesting and less long challenge scenes). I’m more negative on this season than most fans, probably because I prefer drama. I confidently place TAR8 and TAR24 (unpopular seasons) above TAR35 because they were more entertaining.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo after each season I will place it on a ranking:\n\n1.TAR5 - 10/10\n\n2. TAR3 - 10/10\n\n3. TAR12 - 9/10\n\n4. TAR17 - 9/10\n\n5. TAR25 - 9/10\n\n6. TAR31 - 9/10\n\n7. TAR18 - 9/10\n\n8. TAR2 - 8/10\n\n9. TAR7 - 8/10\n\n10. TAR29 - 8/10\n\n11. TAR20 - 8/10\n\n12.

(31, 'reddit', '1oj9ptq', 'Keto again. How I got back', ' I was on keto for 7 years. My purpose has always been to reverse diabetes. At the beginning I lost 32 lbs, and my A1C which was in the diabetic range went to prediabetic and then normal. I started keto by making a set of 3x5 cards. Each had on them one positive or negative about doing keto. For example, \"I will be less likely to develop heart disease,\" and \"I will lose weight.\" I had probably 30 cards. Everytime I sat down to eat, I turned off all distractions and went through the cards before starting. Then I ate slowly and my focus was on eating, not on my phone or anything like that. That was very effective, because my whole family is diabetic and having big heart issues, and I still had a calcium score of zero. So I knew the negatives and positives I had on those cards were true. Once I was down to a size 6, I had to raise my carbs to up to 100 a day, so as not to continue weight loss, but still maintained ketosis most of the time. The final year or two were trickier because all the new \"keto\" foods that weren\'t really keto interfered. It was very tempting to eat keto bread and keto protein bars aka candy bars. So I was on a slippery slope. I found myself going in and out of ketosis more often as a result. Then I went out of the country for a few days and had basically no control over my food, except not to eat, as I was with a group and not on my own. I was not prepared to fast for that long, but tried to avoid carbs, or at least eat limited amounts. Unfortunately, rice, beans, plantains, and very little meat meant I was way out of ketosis pretty fast. My blood sugar was way up too. When I came back home, I decided to take a break from keto, having gotten so lazy it almost didn\'t seem like keto, just to see what would happen. I stayed off keto about 10 months although I originally thought I would do it just for a month. During that time I still preferred low carb, avoiding pasta, etc. and did not eat sugar, but I did use keto foods that were less than ideal, including maintaining my sweet tooth with plenty of fake sugar. I tried to restart keto a few times during that ten months, but was never successful over a few days. During that time I just didn\'t get into ketosis easily, and eating the slightest amount of carbs would make my blood sugar go higher than ever I had experienced it. It looked like I\'d never be able to get back my keto advantage. If that happens to you, you just have to keep going, because it will calm down after a while, and blood sugars will normalize. My A1C, by the way climbed back into the prediabetic range and I very gradually regained 10 lbs. Recently I successfully got back on keto. I had to sit down and have a stern talk with myself about the danger of possible diabetic related effects such as heart disease, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, and a host of other things. Then I made myself a little sign reminding myself of this, ending with \"Every bite counts.\" I put it on my kitchen counter where I still look at it every time I eat. It is so easy to say \"just this one time\" I will make an exception, but I stopped that. For me, a carbaholic, it was like an alcoholic saying \"Just one beer and I\'ll stop.\" Every bite really does count for me.  Limiting myself to 20 to 50 carbs worked for me for restarting. (I am able to maintain ketosis on 100 carbs, although not everyone can do that.) First week results were: re-losing  7 lbs and normalizing my blood sugar at last. Yes, I know it is mostly water weight, but that\'s how it starts. Weight loss continues. I\'m once again in ketosis. Sadly I did experience a lot of thirst and fatigue \"Keto flu,\"  even though carefully making sure I was adding electrolytes to my diet. I\'m not having so much difficulty maintaining now, and am confident I can continue keto as a lifestyle again. It\'s finally feeling like putting on some old comfortable shoes. It\'s pretty easy again.  The biggest thing to overcome was my own rationalization that just this one meal would be okay and I can start tomorrow. Also, overcoming the discouragement of not instantly being in ketosis again, and having unwarranted high blood sugars. Once I\'m back at my normal weight I will slowly transition up to 100 carbs a day, monitoring that to be sure I can still stay in ketosis with that. That\'s how I returned. Summary: The difficulty re-starting was mostly in my head.', 'pro-effective', 'keto', 'https://reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1oj9ptq/keto_again_how_i_got_back/', 16, 6, '2025-10-29 22:47:58', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),
(32, 'reddit', '1oek6y5', '2nd Trip Report Part 1: Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Fukuoka, Aso, Beppu', 'Hi folks - my husband and I are currently in Japan. Last time I was here I wrote up a trip report for our \\~3 week trip as a way to give back and journal a little bit (feel free to find that in my history if you\'d like to see golden route + Hiroshima, Hakone, and some other offshoots).\n\nWe\'re back again for another 3 weeks, again golden route plus going more west this time. We\'re about halfway through currently and I\'ll write up more about our 2nd half of the trip later. We are 30F/M. Feel free to comment with questions. :) I\'ll also be skipping a few parts I wrote about previously, so some helpful comments may be there and/or there may be some typical/obvious visiting spots that aren\'t in this trip report.\n\n**Day 0: Flight - DC area to Haneda - JR East Hotel Mets Premier Akihabara**\n\nSame as last time, I had a super minimal TODO list at the airport - get cash and get our Welcome Suica. We have Android so we cannot get cards on our phone, but my understanding is iPhone can get a Passmo (I think) card on there, which is probably more convenient. The airport train line was pretty convenient getting to Akiba, and also our hotel was literally right outside of the train station so that was pretty handy overall for travel! Generally I prioritize hotels that are close to transit hubs when possible. That said this was definitely one of the smaller hotels I\'ve stayed in (not that that was a problem for us).\n\nSide note, I brought my fullsize carry-on with a smaller Muji suitcase (bought last time) inside it, plus an empty duffel bag, plus my full size backpack with a smaller day backpack inside. Fully prepped for buying stuff. Our plan is to check 3 suitcases going home and carry on any last items bought at the airport.\n\nDinner was just some quick snacks from Family Mart, then passing out.\n\n**Day 1: Tokyo - Akihabara, Ikebukuro, Chiikawa Park**\n\nDay 1 we kept casual and easy since we didn\'t know how our energy would be after 14 hours flying. This trip is also a little funny because it\'s officially our honeymoon, but we had invited a few friends for a week in case anyone wanted to join and make the trip more interesting since we\'d been before. We had 2 friends join us for this week and that went into some of the scheduling and choices we made, including staying in Akiba for the gaming. This morning we just did some gaming then started our shopping at Uniqlo - would recommend buying the things you need for the weather. I got a Slowpoke tee that apparently is sold out in the US and a raincoat that has been the GOAT for the weather. Yodobashi also great for buying anything you need (ex. japanese nail clippers??)\n\nIn 2023, we kept seeing weird little nervous creatures everywhere, which we eventually came to love and know as Chiikawa. So of course in 2025 we had to go to Chiikawa Park. This is connected to the Sunshine City mall so again get more shopping. Though be warned.. I had followed reddit advice that you could cancel tickets if you entered the lottery and didn\'t need them. I didn\'t read closely to see this rule from the park had changed and our group of 4 entered twice and won twice (at least we won!), so I ate the cost of 4 tickets for not trusting the text on the website. bruh. The park was cute though as someone who likes cute things. If you like photo ops, this is the place for you too. We got photos with costumed Hachiware and Usagi who were perfectly in character. The shop was great too - I got a Chiikawa bag that has been the GOAT for lugging around light souvenirs. We had binged the Chiikawa anime before coming to Japan to get the most out of the visit.\n\n**Day 2: Tokyo to Osaka - Candeo Hotels Osaka Namba**\n\nNormally I wouldn\'t have gone to Osaka so quickly, but since our friends were here only for a week and we wanted to spend more time in Osaka, we traveled the next day. We will be back for Tokyo at the end of our trip. Took shinkansen, and our friends figured out some way that you can buy shinkansen tickets from their phones (though buying at the station would have worked just fine too as there are many trains going between Tokyo and Osaka).\n\nOur hotel was actually kind of far from Namba station, further than I thought, so the walk was a little rough as we were still jetlagged and the early Oct weather was still kind of warm. That said.. what we didn\'t realize with this hotel is there is a connected onsen/spa at the top, so this ended up being awesome. I went a couple of times since it was attached to the hotel and it was free - why not? For those not in the know on onsen though, you do need to get fully undressed while up there, then shower in a stall before getting in, then soak, then dry and return. In 2023 I was too nervous to try the public baths, but earlier this year I had tried a korean day spa in the DC area that prepped me for this. My advice would be that it\'s not like everyone is staring at everyone else - we\'re all just trying to get a good soak. :) That said, I found that going at 6am (weaponized jetlag woo!) would usually be less crowded for soaking.\n\nBesides being excited for onsen, we just did an easy evening at Dotonbori which is…more shopping and food. Namba walk underground is great too. Lots of food options at both.\n\n**Day 3: Osaka - Umeda Sky Building, Gardens, More Shopping**\n\nLast time in Osaka, we didn\'t hit the Umeda area, so we went north this time. The Umeda Sky Building gave a great view into the whole city and it has a little garden just outside that I enjoyed.\n\nOn our way back to Shin-Osaka area we hit.. more shopping up top (not sure how we got so shopping heavy at the beginning!). Yodobashi is good, Hands had good/cheap items, Pokemon, Nintendo. HEP FIVE was closed that day but apparently has shopping and a ferris wheel.\n\nI think this day was less revolutionary/less packed (again, jetlag), so here\'s some other fun facts. I discovered most quick marts have vitamin drinks and jellies so I started picking up some of them. Separately, on the way to Umeda there was a little pokemon display - apparently you can go hunting for pokemon to win (read: buy) some sort of mega pokemon item back at Osaka station.\n\n**Day 4: Day Trip to Kobe**\n\nOur friends had tickets to the Nintendo museum and went to visit Kyoto. We are going to Kyoto later (actually here right now as of writing this), so we took a day trip to Kobe instead.\n\nThis was also the first day we activated our 7-day Sanyo San\'in Northern Kyushu Area Pass (JR West/JR Kyushu pass, note: this covers Kyushu region and a little more but not all country). This was helpful for little trips like this, plus all of the shinkansen we took to the Kyushu region. Anything that is a JR line in that area is covered. I used an online pass calculator to determine this was good for us, especially since the full JR Pass increased in price soon after our 2023 trip.\n\nI had written down a ton of options for Kobe: carpentry museum, eat Kobe beef, earthquake museum, the ropeway, sake breweries. In the end there\'s only so much you can do in a single day. If I went back again, I think a sake brewery tour could be cool, maybe the carpentry museum too.\n\nOur main thing for the day ended up being the Kobe Ropeway and Herb Garden. You take the ropeway up and get a good view of the city (incl. seeing Osaka from there!), then at the top there\'s a little european-styled eating area before you walk down through the herb garden. I\'m generally a plant and flower fan so the steep hike down was nice. Apparently it\'s great for photos as we saw lots of photoshoots.\n\nOnce you walk down from the top with ropeway station 3, you get to ropeway station 2, where you can either catch the ropeway back down to 1 or you can hike down. We opted to hike down, though I think the 40 expected minutes was much longer for us. The plus side is it\'s all downhill, the down side is our calves were very tight for a couple of days after. That said there\'s a dam and a bunch of waterfalls which were nice to see. Just be aware that it\'s a bit more of an effort than a light stroll. Oh also, if you opt to do this and you had borrowed an umbrella for the herb garden walk, make sure to return it at ropeway station 2 so you don\'t need to walk back to the ropeway entrance at the end of the hike (which added maybe 10 minutes to our walk :-) ).\n\nOnce at the bottom, we were ready to eat and we wanted Kobe beef…that said we didn\'t want to pay the highest Kobe beef prices. In the end we settled on the incredibly-named Steakland. Definitely not the most luxurious place, but the food was still really good! They book in front of you which is fun. Best piece of beef I\'ve probably eaten. After that, walking and gaming around the station before catching a local train back.\n\n**Day 5: Osaka -&gt; Fukuoka - Tokyu Stay Fukuoka-Tenjin**\n\nThe Kyushu region was the biggest, newest part of our trip. We wanted to hit some of the golden route again but still wanted to hit new spots. Fukuoka is just a shinkansen away. Though as a note, I couldn\'t actually reserve these shinkansen myself since they were all Nozomi trains, so we ended up having to pop into a JR West office (note: not the same as a regular JR office - they will redirect you if needed) to have them book a reservation for us. Thankfully trains weren\'t too crowded in October so we got a train for 10 mins later.\n\nToday was mostly travel, so nothing too long to report. We did walk around the Tenjin area and got some private Ichiran ramen - so good, and the private dining experience was fun to try. Tenjin also has a lot of shopping and activity. If I could go back, I would have gone into the smaller fashion stores that lined a lot of the side streets, as one of my trip goals is to get a bit more j-fashion items to bring back.\n\n**Day 6: Fukuoka - Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,** \n\nDuring my planning, I had heard both Uminonakamichi and Nokonoshima Island Park were interesting. We ended up going with the former, which is the sort of park where people love to bring their kids and families for a day just relaxing and playing outside. It was less \"tourist\" (or maybe that\'s all of Kyushu), but fun to see a park, nature, and people just having a good time!\n\nTransit getting here is a little inconvenient, so plan to take extra time. I think we had 3 trains in total so we were sitting for a bit (not bad to have the break though). We also didn\'t rent a bike at the beginning but wish we had because the park is surprisingly big and involved a lot of walking from us. Our favorite areas were going to the north side to see the water and the big flower park around the west side.\n\nWe had a late start today, plus travel and the park took a while, so we didn\'t have time to get to other Fukuoka items today (we punted them to later). Rest of the day was dinner at Hakata station plus.. more shopping! There\'s a lot of options in Hakata at least. I forget the name but we got a bowl that started as a rice bowl but you add broth halfway through to turn it into something new.\n\n**Day 7: Day Trip - Mt Aso**\n\nToday was either going to be Mt Aso or a day trip in Kumamoto. We opted for the latter, but if we had done Kumamoto I would have tried to check these out: Kumamoto castle, manga museum, one piece statues, record stores\n\nI\'d heard good things about Mt Aso though, so we took multiple hours of transit (truly…non-reserved shinkansen to Kumamoto, smaller train to Aso Station, bus up Mt Aso). After all of that…we found there were toxic gasses coming out so we couldn\'t see the crater. bummer!! I actually completely forgot to check the volcano status, which you can do on their website. That said, I watched the status over the next few days out of curiosity, and it\'s totally possible you could have good conditions one hour and then the next hour have it be closed, so I think it was truly a toss-up whether we\'d see the crater or not. We really enjoyed seeing the countryside though along the trains.\n\nAlso, we didn\'t have this on the way over (didn\'t book in time), but on our way back we took the Asoboy train. Dog/Kuro themed train that goes direct from Aso Station to Kumamoto. So cute and faster than the train we took over. This was easy to book with our JR West pass.\n\nBack at Kumamoto, we at least made sure to eat horse sashimi and buy Kumamon items, before catching another non-reserved shinkansen back up to Fukuoka.\n\n**Day 8: Fukuoka -&gt; Beppu - Seikaiso**\n\nBefore heading over to Beppu, we took the morning/early afternoon to catch some things we missed in Fukuoka. The castle ruins were cool and were next to Ohori park which was pleasant and lively. My husband really wanted to grab Shinshin ramen before we left - we sat in a long queue near Tenjin underground mall that only ended up being a 20 min wait or so. Good ramen! Then did a last minute look at Tenjin underground mall which we had somehow missed. Then grabbed a non-reserved seat on the Sonic Express to Beppu.\n\nAs cool as the cities are, we really enjoyed getting to quiet Beppu. We stayed in a Ryokan so we had good food and onsen access. Our first night also had a small onsen in our room too so we spent a lot of time just soaking and relaxing. If we had left sooner and were more motivated, maybe I would have gone to Takasakiyama monkey park, but the relaxing was definitely appreciated.\n\n**Day 9: Beppu - Hells of Beppu, Kifune Castle, Beppu Tower**\n\nBetween onsen, we did take our one full day in Beppu to see the tourist items. Travel is a little more inconvenient here since you need to take busses, but it\'s not impossible. With infinite time we would hit the ropeway, but we decided the Hells of Beppu seemed more interesting and unique. These are multi-color onsen for looking (not swimming). They\'re across multiple locations but if you start at Umi, there\'s lots of guidance on how to see them all. Most are walkable but the last 2 need a bus. We thought the first one was coolest, and least favorite was 4th because for some reason they also have a bunch of crocodiles in small cages there…weird. \n\nI love castles, so we stopped by Kifune castle, but this was definitely not the same big tourist trap like the Hells of Beppu. We did get a personal tour by a man who didn\'t speak english but had a book to share facts, and I\'m not sure if he does this for everyone or if we were truly \"lucky\" but he left us pet the 6th generation white snake, guardian of the castle. Pretty cool! That said, this whole castle is a recreation, so not as cool as the ones still standing. I think Himeji Castle has still been my all time favorite as that interior is as-is.\n\nLast was Beppu Tower for another high view of the city. There\'s apparently an art museum here too though we skipped it.\n\nFinally made our way to Gu in one of the shopping malls before returning for dinner and onsen.\n\n**Day 10: Beppu -&gt; Kyoto - Hotel Gracery Kyoto Sanjo**\n\nYesterday we sadly left Beppu for a long travel day to Kyoto. This was definitely our longest travel date: Sonic limited express, to Shinkansen which only went to Shin-Osaka (per JR Pass), to local train to Kyoto, to subway to hotel. I think this was something like 6 hours. Perhaps a flight could have been an option, but the convenience of the JR pass (already paid) is definitely nice.\n\nBeppu vs Kyoto is such a big difference though. Beppu is a much quieter town, off the typical travel path, there\'s a lot more Japanese people and a lot fewer english speakers (though we did see a ton of European tourists specifically). Kyoto by comparison (especially in Nishiki market area) feels VERY full of tourists. I\'m excited to see Kyoto again as it was our favorite spot last time, but I will definitely miss the quieter Kyushu region! I\'d definitely recommend heading out there if you\'re interested in going beyond the golden route.\n\nAfter arriving in Kyoto, we just did some light shopping before getting Mos Burger and doing late night gaming. I\'ll write up the rest of our plans in our next trip report! In the meantime, feel free to share comments, questions, or recommendations for our last visits to Kyoto, Yokohama, and Tokyo. :)', 'queen-kiwi', 'JapanTravel', 'https://reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1oek6y5/2nd_trip_report_part_1_tokyo_osaka_kobe_fukuoka/', 14, 7, '2025-10-24 06:48:17', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

I (16f) am not necessarily a picky eater, however there are a few things I can’t eat cuz it makes me nauseous (mostly seafood, foods with strong or clashing flavors).\n\nI’ve never had a big appetite but I’ve always been within a healthy weight. I currently go to a boarding school in a country that eats a lot of those kinds of foods. I still try to eat, but I usually just get salad and rice, or sometimes meat if we have that which is rare.\n\nAfter the first two months I’d lost about 15.5 lbs (so I was underweight). I also started getting very nauseous after eating just a few bites. Obviously this worried both my parents and I so I started eating more whenever we had something my stomach and taste buds tolerated even though it still made me nauseous.\n\nOne day we had burger and fries, and, ngl, I don’t trust the burgers here, so I only ate the fries. I also decided to take some extra cuz my friends love fries so I knew they’d take some from me after finishing their own. I took just a little bit more than the people with burgers did (maybe a small spoonful more).\n\nWhen I was on my way to my table a teacher (G) (who had a burger and even more fries than me) walked up to me and said “wow, that’s a lot of food… you really gonna eat all that?”. Keep in mind that this guy had way more, which is fair cuz he’s bigger than me, but while I’m underweight and desperately trying to go back to normal weight, he’s on the opposite side of the bmi spectrum. (I don’t really care about other people’s weight, but I think it’s kinda important context)\n\nMy friend (R) who was with me at the time just stared at him in shock while I was like “…wtf?”. I ended up just saying “oh, haha, yeah. I’m not eating a burger so I’m making up for it by eating fries” in the most polite way possible. He responded with “still, keep eating like that and you’ll be fat” before walking away.\n\nAfter that comment I completely lost my appetite and ended up only eating a few fries (dw my friends ate the rest so nothing went to waste). During dinner R told our friends what G said and they shared stories about him commenting on them too (stuff like “that’s a lot of makeup” (it was a normal amount) and “damn, are you sure that skirt isn’t a bit too short?” My friend had rolled her uniform skirt once (which basically everyone does) and you would only be able to notice if you looked really close).\n\nAfter dinner my friends decided to go to our dorm parent about it who was furious at G, but told us she couldn’t do anything. However, she did advise us to talk to someone higher up who would actually be able to do something.

(35, 'reddit', '1o9k3wm', 'Haircare', 'I am not a doctor, and this is not really a prescription or suggestion, just what worked for me.\n\nI had really bad hair fall for a long time — the kind that makes you check the mirror constantly and try to hide the thin spots with strategic hair placement. I’ve mostly recovered now.\n\nFirst things first, its a long journey. I had bad hair fall since 2022 and only now I have recovered it so that I don\'t need to care about hairplacement. Also the grind is eternal, so you will have to take care of your hair forever. \n\nAlso I am male, so idk for females, but my hair fall was not androgenic based, it was stress based for the most part.\n\nI needed three things to correct it all.\n\nDiet, Sleep and haircare.\n\n# 1. Diet\n\nI completely stopped junk food and started eating only home-cooked meals. No chips, pizzas, or packaged snacks. Especially nothing that comes out of a plastic wrapper. I just makde my mindset that anything coming out of a wrapper is bad for me, kurkure, biscuits and even toffees. I blocked them all. Yeah, leaving pizza was hard and I had my cheat days once a month or so, but even minimizing it helps, one should not aim are minimizing thou, cuz only when you aim at perfection can you hope for progress here. I replaced all my cheats, treats and junk food occasions with fruits. Just have some, instead of those pizza just get a pineapple one ay and you will fall in love with the fruit. Get others too grapes, apple, mangoes etc  are very tasty. Buy them yourself, go out and buy them yourself, dont rely on someone else to get them for you. And buy them in 1kg quantity. Eating a fruit for the whole day wont imbalance any nutrients, its only going to make it better if anything. Just try eating fruits for one whole day.\n\nMultivitamins can help, but they aren’t magic pills. They only support your diet, not replace it. I took one daily, and slowly transtioned out of them, as natural things are better. If you have no money, its zincovit, 90 ruppee for fifteen. If you have money, its wellman. But really, multivitamin are temporary things. Do not make them a replacement for diet. Do them like for just one course, and transition to a healthy diet.\n\nProtein is necessary. I am not saying go for protein powders, but a minimum of some protein daily is batshit necessary. It was a liter of milk for me, my starting point. Anything above is better, but a minimum of that daily is just that, the minimum. idk how many eggs but two to three are good to go. Throw away old thinking that its not, India is a protein deficient country and you need protein for everything.\n\nIf you are poor (like me) with little financial freedom, zincovit and milk helps, but being rich here really helps. I slowly transitioned my way up here, telling my mum and she supported me (ofc she did) with money. If you are rick start with wellman, good diet, daily fruits and milk. If you are super rich, get yourself whey protein. You dont even need to fill their scoop, just have some, like a spoonful. like we did with bourn vita and horlicks. Use them like that. Whey protein is what horlicks and bourn vita were meant to be, but were not. \n\nAnd less sugar. like way less. 40gm a day is daily req. You get that much from everything you eat even if you dont take sugar. your rotis, rice etc does them. 400ml coca cola also has that much sugar (your daily requirement) with no nutrients to speak of.\n\nLabel padega india is a boon. just turn back the labels. And see how many serves a pack has. \n\nYippee maggi, the shittiest maggi is the best example. One pack is actually two severs, i.e. if there is one person, he is supposed to ear just half of the smallest pack. Most people eat two packs at once, which is four serves recommend by the company itself. The sodium one pack provides is about 40 percent daily requirement, and again, no nutritive value.\n\n\n\n# 2. Sleep\n\nSleep changed everything for me. I made it a rule to get at least seven plus hours every night, ideally from 10 PM to 5 AM. i.e early sleep early rise.  Sleep is the easiest de stressed. No words need be said for this one. Not only the time is required, 7 plus hours, but the timings too. Sleeping 3 to 10 wont cut it.\n\n\n\n# 3. Haircare\n\nIf your issue is dandruff, dryness, or sun damage, fixing that is needed.\n\nFor dandruff, I used a medicated ketoconazole shampoo (an antifungal one). I used it three times a week initially, and each time I used it twice in one bath — apply, wait two minutes, wash, and then reapply once more. That routine really cleared up the flakes. You will see difference in using small amount twice in one bath instead of big amount once in bath.\n\nAfter washing, I sometimes applied aloe vera gel mixed with a bit of oil (coconut or mustard or almond oil) on my scalp. It looked greasy, but it calmed the skin and reduced itching. Remember its not to imprss someone, but recover. I prefer looking like snape but recovering, compared to looking like Lockhart and loosing it alllater.\n\nAfter about two to three weeks, the dandruff was mostly gone. Then I reduced the medicated shampoo to once or twice a week and switched to a gentler shampoo and conditioner routine.\n\nOnce the dandruff settled, I switched to regular shampoos. You need to pair good shampoo and conditioner. But if not get like somewhat cheaper shampoo but absolutely do conditioner. \n\nShampoo cheap but good one is that 1liter onion shampoo, i dont remember the brand but that is one big bottle. Expensive ones like Dove, Tresemmé, or L’Oréal are also good. I dont like dove tho, so it was tressemme and loreal for me. \n\nThe important part is using a conditioner. Due to pollution, bad air, bad water and everything else our civic sense has graced us with, Conditioner isn’t optional — it replaces the need for post-wash oiling on the hair strands (not the scalp).\n\nRead how to use condtioner, and use it. If you cant afford conditioner bottle, dont. Buy satchels. Dove and tresseme has conditioner and shampoo satchels, five rupees for both. Use them. Do not oil or aloe vera gel on conditioner hair. Conditioner is for hair only, not scalp.\n\nMy routine became:\n\n* Shampoo two to three times a week in total, initially ketoconacole one, later 1 or two time keto, other time the expensive good ones. Slowly transtion out of keto ones as they are quite harsh and are only there to end the dandruff.\n\nOver time, I phased out the medicated one completely and only brought it back if my scalp felt itchy again.\n\n\n\n# 5. Scalp Protection\n\nIf your scalp gets itchy, apply aloe vera gel instead of scratching.  Do not scratch your scalp. Use aloe vera gel to cool it off, or just water. Also, protect your head from direct sunlight by wearing a cap when going out. The sun can dry the scalp and worsen shedding. \n\nNavratan oil doesnt help. It feels like helping but its just mint in it that does temporary cooling. Aloe vera, castor oil (very sticky and heavy) and coconut oil helps. \n\nThe best one among this, is you guessed it, the worst feeling one, castor oil. its very heavy and sticky. Do it if you have shaved head.\n\n\n\n# 6. For Men\n\nDoing all this after shaving your head once can help the products and oils work directly on the scalp. Ketoconazole, aloe vera, and oiling are far more effective when applied on clean, exposed skin.\n\nAnd yes, reducing stress and avoiding bad habits like excessive screen time or fapping actually helps more than people think. It’s all connected to hormone balance and sleep.\n\n\n\n# 7. Doctors and Realism\n\nYou can and should see a dermatologist. But in my case, the doctor pushed minoxidil and DHT blockers, which weren’t needed — my hair fall was mostly stress and lifestyle-based, not genetic. That experience distrust doctors in general. I focused on fixing my habits before using any chemical treatments.\n\n\n\n# 8. Final Thoughts\n\nHair recovery takes months, not days. I started this around 2022 and only now have visibly fuller hair. It’s not perfect, but it’s progress — and it came from discipline, not expensive products.\n\n', 'Any-Top-5659', 'MEDICOreTARDS', 'https://reddit.com/r/MEDICOreTARDS/comments/1o9k3wm/haircare/', 18, 5, '2025-10-18 08:23:19', '2025-11-07 23:40:40');

(37, 'reddit', '1oq7tfw', 'I tell people I\'m Brazilian because I hate being Indian', 'F20, and the guilt has been eating at me for a long time.\n\nThe reason why I do it is because of casual racism I experienced growing up in UK primary/secondary schools. Opening my curry rice lunch and have others grimace/make fun of how it smells; sprouting more facial/bodily hair than I would like from a young age, making me look manly instead of a desirable feminine; the stereotypes of Indian = unclean being enforced when I sweat more than normal girls because of hormones and it stinks. The whole second-class citizen treatment I get when I tell people I’m Indian stinks- I’m sick of everyone assuming we’re cringy weirdos who have strict families that prevent us from having any fun so we study all the time and turn out to be married to the work (which is true for me btw).\n\nI’m 20 and yes, I date casually because I wasn’t allowed to growing up. I find that as soon as I tell guys that I am Brazilian, they become very, very interested (especially the white guys). They suddenly don’t care that I have sideburns or a faint moustache, or dark, deep eyebags which I cover up with crusty concealer, or that I’m part of the IBTC or that my backside is a weird shape- they think they are rizzing up Adriana Lima. I know from personal experience that they wouldn’t look twice if I said that I’m from a South Asian/Middle Eastern/African country, although I personally don’t care about the ethnicity of the guy I’m talking to. The same applies to when I’m trying to be friends with girls and it hurts :( I tell my friends at uni the truth that I am Indian, but when I go out I have a different Latin-sounding name and I’m Brazilian, and I’m lucky that they don’t know it.\n\nI say that I don\'t care the ethnicity of the men I date, but I\'ve found myself subconsciously avoiding Desi/Arab men. This stems from trauma from school, where people assumed incest was common in Indian families- a painful stereotype that unfortunately applies to my own aunt and uncle who are cousins- and I desperately wanted to avoid the \"siblings or dating\" allegations. Deeper than this, I know there\'s a heavy cultural expectation for me to marry an Indian man eventually. I saw this firsthand when my older brother had a massive argument with our parents after my dad saw him joking with a Black girl (who was so pretty and was very sweet from what I can remember); he had to insist she was merely a group member for a school project, not a friend, even though he later admitted to me privately years ago that he had a crush on her. He’s happily married now to an Indian girl who he adores, but this casual racism within Indian society makes me want to explore as many dating options (in secret btw) as I can before societal and familial expectations ultimately tie me down to a brown guy.\n\nYes I know I am extremely male-centred and it disgusts me. Growing up, I saw women in my family get university degrees and end up top of the class just to end up as a housewife because of societal conditioning/expectations that once you have a rich man, you are sorted for life. They often end up in unhappy marriages where he becomes entitled and the women props up the patriarchy because ‘he’s a provider’, but divorce is practically unheard of because of the societal shame that is directed towards the woman for it. The lie that has been fed to us constantly growing up is that we need to not focus on men and relationships at all so that we can get good grades and be successful in our careers, but the real reason why we get good grades is so that we are more ‘appealing ’ to men who would want to marry us. This ultimately made me seeking male validation a lot and I’m trying so hard to find who I am without a man in the picture and break generational trauma, but at the same time I want to date and let off some steam.\n\nWhy Brazilian? I stumbled across Argentinean trap music 4 years ago and became obsessed. Can you blame me? In general, songs sang in Spanish is 10000x better than English songs imo. I wanted to pass myself off as Argentinean instead, but my 18 year old brain told me no-one would believe me because I’m not white-passing, so Brazilian was the closest alternative. I don’t listen to Bollywood songs/watch Bollywood movies because to my self-hating brain, they are all incredibly cringe. I’m scared to post TikToks with Spanish songs as someone my age would do because I don’t want my friends from uni to clock that I am cosplaying a Latina as an Indian, although I genuinely love the music. I also don’t know anything about Brazilian culture or any Portuguese at all, and I know that every time I open my mouth to say that I am Brazilian, I am disrespecting an entire culture and history, which is why I feel extremely guilty about it.\n\nI am not a victim, I am a perpetrator. Nothing I have said excuses the appropriation that I have been doing for the past 2 years and I’m trying so hard to love racial identity, but it’s so hard seeing all the brown hate across the internet and in our casual settings.', 'motomami_434', 'offmychest', 'https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oq7tfw/i_tell_people_im_brazilian_because_i_hate_being/', 2, 3, '2025-11-07 02:07:21', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),
(38, 'reddit', '1onsmdv', 'ENFP/INFJ friendship into relationship?', 'Apologies for the long post. I (ENFP, F27) am relatively new to the personality tests, and my partner (M27) of 10 months just tested as an INFJ. We have been struggling over the past few months and agreed to do some deeper diving into who we are as individuals to see if we really think we can thrive in a future together. We were best friends through Law School and up until we started dating (about 4 years). He was always routine, motivated, and relatively \"simple,\" while I  was chaotic. I was always bouncing around at a million miles an hour. After all of the chaos of Law School and our other relationships died down, a deep romantic attraction to his stability and commitment (that wasn\'t there originally) surfaced for me. I felt like he had really truly grown and matured over the years, and was a wonderful partner. Apparently, the attraction had always been there for him, but he would never act on it because of our friendship and some of my own traumatic experiences, which I really appreciated. In the beginning, I finally felt safe in a relationship. Like I wasn\'t constantly chasing and spiraling. I finally felt loved. He finally felt like someone with his same core values would commit to all of him. We both thought this was it.\n\nWe moved in together pretty fast (in July) because we knew each other so well, he was looking for a new place, and I lived alone in a house already that was affordable. We quickly began to realize just how different we are, and that we might have overestimated each of our abilities to understand the other. We KNOW each other better than anyone. We could each explain each other for hours. But neither of us really feels understood or supported on a deeper level.\n\nHe follows strict routines and needs to feel safe and stable at all times. He is anxious but never angry and we communicate very well (no yelling, focus on logic, and listen), but he struggles to not take things very personally and idealizes commitment and perfection over everything. He is an introvert and relatively reserved. He watches sports at least 5 days a week, has a strict early morning work out routine, and would eat the same chicken or beef and rice every day if he could. He has not traveled out of the country more than a couple quick trips and wants the white picket fence family life. If he sounds like a different personality type, I would be interested to know, but his report was pretty spot on. He also tests as a Loyalist on the enneagram.\n\nI, on the other hand, not only have severe recently-diagnosed (and treated) ADHD, but am constantly seeking new experiences, flavors, feelings, knowledge, friends etc. I travel out of the country a lot and am deeply passionate about human rights and fights for justice. I run an animal rescue and am constantly taking on new projects, most recently a local mayoral campaign that was arguably too much for myself. I am overwhelmingly frustrated with our nation and realistically see myself leaving the country if I can wrap up most of my projects here/move the animals. I am the parentified child and mediator in most social situations, but am also very opinionated. I test as a Helper and Challenger on the enneagram tests.\n\nWe knew all of these things (other than the personality labels) getting into the relationship. I made both physical and mental space for him (quit one of my 3 soccer teams, welcomed him onto the other two teams, rehomed a rescue horse, scheduled sports-watching activities, learned to play golf and golf with him, hang out with my friends and family far less, etc.), and he stayed with me instead of moving with his family, and has paused his search for a sports job that would be more satisfying for him. It was way easier for me to shuck off his routine when it wasn\'t controlling my day. It was a lot easier to enjoy and talk about sports games with him when they weren\'t playing every day in my living space. We\'ve talked a lot about these things and changing them would be changing core parts of him. If I absorbed them, I feel I would be abandoning core parts of myself. Our intimate life is hanging on by a thread because he is paralyzed by the idea of trying something new (even just a position) and failing, while I feel all of our conversations about it are eventually ignored by the time we are intimate. \n\nIt feels pretty clear that we are not compatible. I thought that incompatibility could be outweighed by love, commitment, and communication. Unfortunately, I cannot bring myself to truly understand and validate his need for his work out routine, his need to watch all sports often and regardless of team (he is flexible in the sense that we can be doing something else, but he will have sports on his phone or laptop, which is also starting to drive me crazy), or his lack of motivation to try new foods, experience new places, and be explorative in intimacy. He would try new things, but only for me, and I can tell he is just doing it to get it over with (he says \"I will try food as many times as it takes for me to be sure I don\'t like it\" instead of \"I want to like this and I\'ll try it as many times as it takes for me to like it\"). Everything is the same routine, and it is draining for me. On the flip side, I can tell he is overwhelmed by how much I have going on and how much I wish he felt motivated to meaningfully engage with my world. He cannot bring himself to get excited or engage with what I am into. Sometimes world news has me so upset that I come home resentful that it doesn\'t really seem to affect him. While it was initially easy and exciting for me to engage with his world, learn and play his sports, join his fantasy teams, watch games on TV, the feeling that he is just not excited or passionate about any of my stuff is killer and has made it harder for me to genuinely engage. He claims it is because he is quiet, but he is not quiet when it is something he has an internal connection to. This is not to say he isn\'t supportive. He supports me and will do anything I ask him to, it just doesn\'t give me that electrifying feeling that you get when someone really wants to engage.\n\nWe just about broke up last week and agreed our ideals and futures do not align. It was hours of crying and just pure sadness. But the next day he said he wanted to try. It feels like he would hold on no matter what, even if he knows we can\'t support each other. I told him that I didn\'t know what trying looked like. It isn\'t just \"I\'ll try to eat Asian food once a month for her,\" like he wants it to be. I told him we could likely make our day-to-day easier, but that it may only delay the inevitable because we envision different futures. I told him we\'d have to do some deep exploration in an attempt to really grasp where we are. It\'s also far more complicated living together. I love him, and deciding the moment where we have to stop while still loving each other feels impossible. \n\nI got on this page to learn a little more about our pairing and am seeing lots of people say how compatible we should be, but I can\'t help but feel suffocated and drained. It is devastating because, no matter how we frame it, we are losing both a relationship and our friendship, even if we remained amicable. Is there anyone here that has had a similar experience or can explain why we were so compatible as close friends, but not in a relationship? Is a lot of this our differences in personality, or more because of our environments and experiences? I never wanted to change him, but hoped that once we shared experiences, he would build some of his own connection to my world. Any tips are welcome, but I don\'t know that we are salvageable at this point.

I currently go to a boarding school in a country that eats a lot of those kinds of foods. I still try to eat, but I usually just get salad and rice, or sometimes meat if we have that which is rare.\n\nAfter the first two months I’d lost about 15.5 lbs (so I was underweight). I also started getting very nauseous after eating just a few bites. Obviously this worried both my parents and I so I started eating more whenever we had something my stomach and taste buds tolerated even though it still made me nauseous.\n\nOne day we had burger and fries, and, ngl, I don’t trust the burgers here, so I only ate the fries. I also decided to take some extra cuz my friends love fries so I knew they’d take some from me after finishing their own. I took just a little bit more than the people with burgers did (maybe a small spoonful more).\n\nWhen I was on my way to my table a teacher (G) (who had a burger and even more fries than me) walked up to me and said “wow, that’s a lot of food… you really gonna eat all that?”. Keep in mind that this guy had way more, which is fair cuz he’s bigger than me, but while I’m underweight and desperately trying to go back to normal weight, he’s on the opposite side of the bmi spectrum.

All the stories I read here are what helped me stay sane.\n\nEarly August I took the morning-after pill . I had several episodes of spotting, but my period never really came. I thought it was just a side effect of the pill. Since I have polycystic ovary syndrome, my cycles were never regular, always heavy and long. I believed that by October, everything would normalize. But October came, and still nothing.\n\nOn October 8th, driven by anxiety, I took a test. A faint line appeared (but it was definitely two lines). That same day I went for a blood test, and the result confirmed it: I was pregnant, already many weeks along.\n\nI had several symptoms, but they all went unnoticed. I truly believed it was just another gastritis flare-up, that my fatigue and sleepiness were from university exams, that the sensitivity in my breasts was just an endless PMS while my cycle tried to regulate itself. I see now how naive I was but I had gone months without menstruating before, with no pregnancy risk and without any sexual activity.\n\nI confided in a friend who had gone through an abortion before ( 6 weeks failed and 9 weeks) , and she gave me the contact for the pills . Only she, my boyfriend, and I knew. I didn’t tell anyone else, didn’t get an ultrasound. I couldn’t do it at home, so we had to find an excuse to stay somewhere else.\nThe information they provided wasn\'t similar to the forums or reliable sources, but I didn\'t understand the quantity of the medicines, everything seemed so confusing, I just didn\'t want it to go wrong.\n\nOctober 18th, a Saturday.\n\n9:16 AM - 1st dose: 4 intervaginal pills\n\nAt my boyfriend\'s house, we began the procedure: 4 misoprostol pills. I experienced all the symptoms: it started with mild cramping, chills, then very intense cramping. I could barely get ready before vomiting. The cramping went from the type of pain I was used to feeling during my period to a different kind of pain, which came in waves. 30 seconds of relief, and then such excruciating pain, the worst cramping of my life.\nThe person who sold me the pills was also monitoring the procedure through the messaging app. Per their recommendation, I started the procedure on an empty stomach, and I couldn\'t vomit ( The hardest thing ).\n\n11:46 AM - I had diarrhea, just a drop of blood on the pad, and my goal was to reduce nausea before taking the sublingual dose, so I ate some rice crackers and grapes and drank Gatorade. I took ondansetron to reduce nausea.\n\n11:55 AM - 2nd dose (2 sublingual tablets)\n\n12:18 PM  - 3rd dose (2 sublingual tablets)\n\nI started with 2 sublingual tablets to test for nausea, then added 2 more. I noticed that no matter what I did, I would vomit within an hour of taking the tablets, but everything went well anyway.\nSame symptoms: it started with very strong cramps and chills, and then progressed to wave-like pain. I felt pressure in my vagina/vulva that I didn\'t identify as pressure; it felt more like it was sore.\nFrom the reports, I thought this was just the beginning, that the pain would get much worse in the next few hours (which made me desperate), but it actually wasn\'t.\n\n2:15 PM - Light exercise\n\nThe woman who was following us via text suggested to eat a little more, stay hydrated, and do some light exercise, like walking. I decided to dance a little. I felt so bad, I wanted something to lift my mood.\n\n2:28 PM - Water broke + 3 sublingual tablets\n\nDuring the third song, I felt fluid coming out. My water had broken. Walking to the bathroom, a lot of fluid and blood came out, soaking everything. At that point, I had already put in 3 more sublingual tablets (this all happened before they dissolved).\nIn the bathroom, everything happened very quickly, within minutes. First, a few clots came out, and when I bent down to look at the fetus, half came out, and the rest came out a second later.\nI didn\'t feel any pain, or didn\'t realize I was feeling pain, but it was nothing like the pain before.\n\n2:38 PM - The fetus fell into my hands. I saw him. A boy. My first child. He was small but perfectly formed, ten fingers, ten toes, curled up as if still sleeping.Writing this part makes me cry, it feels unreal. It\'s so strange to think about it, my son.\n\nThe placenta came out soon after, impossible to confuse with a clot; it took a few minutes for it to come out completely.\n\n2:58 PM - Time the placenta came out completely.\n\nPost:\n\n4:00 PM - Over the next 3-4 hours, I bled a considerable amount, and several clots. Mild cramping. I was able to eat lunch without any problems. I also had a low fever, which quickly subsided with the dipyrone.\n\n8:00 PM - The bleeding had already decreased considerably, it resembled a moderate menstrual flow. I already felt fine, just tired.\n\nThe next day, August 19th - The last clot came out the next morning. I had mild cramping throughout the day, and light-moderate bleeding.\nThe pills gave me a strange sensation on my tongue that I can\'t describe, but it passed quickly, and the next day I was back to normal.\n\nI still don\'t know what to think about everything that happened, but it happened much faster, and I took much less medication than I expected (at 13 weeks, I expected at least 12 pills before it would work).

They’re hard to describe, so I’ll pose you this analogy to give you the right foundation.\n\nI have a lot of these vague glimpses of memories, from when I was a very young child, of my own parents socialising, having a drink with friends, hosting events, whatever, where I’d wander downstairs to get a snack or something and I’d feel a little bit caught off guard for a moment by the sight of strangers in my house that my parents seemed to be getting on fine with. My parents would try to introduce me to their friend or cousin that I didn’t recognise, but I’d forget about whoever they were shortly after. I feel like a lot of people have early childhood memories like that, because when we were very young children, our parents were naturally younger too and were spending more time keeping up with friends and whatnot.\n\nSometimes, I’ll get a glimpse of something like a wine glass or a lit candle on a table and feel myself floating away, back into vague flashes and feelings of a dinner party my parents had one night with the in-laws or something like that. And that’s what I’m getting at: random feelings of recognition in your surroundings that give you hard to pin down senses of familiarity, leading you back to half-formed memories. But the way I experience it is a bit different. It’s not Déjà vu. It’s more like a stutter. A momentary glitch in my own perception. I like to call it static.\n\nIt usually happens when I’m run-down, sleep-deprived, or after smoking too much weed too quick. Like, for example, I’ll be lying in bed hungover, listening to the low hum of my desk fan, and for a split second, the hum will resolve. It’ll sound like a distant crowd of people cheering excitedly about something, or a woman singing a song in a different language. The weirdest part, then, is the feeling that follows. The absolute, bone-deep realisation that I’ve been listening to those noises for the last five minutes, I just hadn’t realised it yet. It’s like a retroactive certainty. My conscious mind is always the last to know.\n\nI’ve felt this “static” with sights, too. Like, a particular shade of peeling yellow paint on a bus stop that I gazed at for a few minutes before suddenly feeling sure I’d seen it on the wall of a hospital room somewhere I’d been in once when I was a kid. The feeling is never, “Hey, that looks familiar.” It’s “There it is again. It’s been here the whole time.”\n\nI’ve always written it off. A trick of a tired brain. My synapses misfiring. It’s always been so easy to disregard, because it was so rare. That was before everything that’s happened.\n\nHow it starts is I’d already been feeling hungover and out of it from the house party I’d been at the previous day. It was 2 pm by the time I was up from the couch. I started my day, just like Anthony and the others waking up at his flat, with a breakfast of leftover Chinese poorly re-heated in the microwave, a glass of Dr. Pepper from the bottle we’d been using last night for mixers, and a few bong rips. So, by the time we’d gotten ourselves sufficiently baked, it was 4 pm and I was walking to the bus stop with our group. Anthony’s flat is in an estate about a twenty-minute walk down some barren roads and suburbs away from the town where me and him grew up. We were walking with some of the other guys and gals from the party with the intention of getting a bus back over to where our community college is, an hour or so away, where most of us were living in student accommodation. But somewhere along the way, in the scorching heat of the day and our hazy state, we took a wrong turn. Even Anthony wasn’t sure exactly where we were. We had a loose idea, since we were still near the huge woods of the state park that enclosed around much of the area between Anthony’s estate and our hometown. As we kept walking and chatting aimlessly, we eventually stumbled upon a strange pub, a sort of half-bar, half-arcade that was set up across from an empty, dusty yard or lot. There were only a few run-down bungalows nearby.\n\nWe stared at the odd pub. I felt sure it was just a lame dive bar with a few arcade machines shoved in the corners to get 80’s nostalgic types all horny and drain them with shitty bar prices, but we were so bored and stoned that we saw the possibility of arcade games and freshly poured beers and thought, “Sure, why not.”\n\nWhile everyone spent the following hours throwing back drinks in our elegantly dishevelled state in that crummy place, a strange sense of premonition in my mind, and Anthony’s too, I think, seemed to have sprouted. A strange feeling of growing dread, a sense of anticipation for some huge revelation. That feeling kept growing, something completely unknown and yet undeniable, as time passed into evening and then nightfall, as I continued drinking, trying to make conversation with people, chatting with girls I liked the look of, normal bar stuff. I remember there was this fat, nasty spider in one of the corners of the ceiling. It hadn’t made a web, it was just slowly skulking about in circles. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.\n\nNow, my buddy Anthony is what you’d call an experienced tripper. He believes in expanding the mind, so to speak. I was always the cautious one. Anthony tapped on my shoulder late into the night and took me outside, where he showed me the tabs of acid he’d been talking about. I remember feeling that the moment was important. I mean that moment, standing outside that strange pub at night, staring across the road at that dusty yard and, behind it, the woods – I knew that I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. Even though nothing that special was really even going on. I knew I’d remember Anthony’s Marietta t-shirt. I’d remember the pile of tires scattered in the yard. I’d remember the rusty storm drain a few feet from where we stood at the pub’s entrance. We decided my first acid trip should be somewhere peaceful, in nature, so we picked one of the winding country roads around and through the state park woods, and started walking. Then we partook.\n\nThe come-up was fine. A little giddiness, the trees looking a bit more vibrant. Then I hit the peak. The world started to breathe. The asphalt of the road pulsed like a vein. Anthony was walking beside me, talking about the lifecycle of moss or something, his voice a steady, grounding presence. But then, a second voice started up.\n\nIt was also Anthony’s voice. But it wasn’t coming from beside me. It was inside my head, clear as day, as though he were sitting in an empty room right behind my eyes. He was commenting on my thoughts, narrating my panic.\n\n“He’s thinking about the fan now,” the internal Anthony-voice said as I looked in utter disorientation at the real Anthony, calm and conversational. “He’s wondering if it’s all connected.”\n\n I stared at the real Anthony. His mouth was moving, talking about how the universe is all connected and that means busting a nut and getting a girl pregnant is basically the same as planting a tree sapling. The voice of Anthony in my head, however, was speaking directly to me.\n\n“Dude, you okay?” the real Anthony asked. “You’re looking a little pale.”\n\nThat’s when I saw a third man off in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, standing off the path under the canopy of an ancient oak tree, was a man. He was tall, gaunt, looked to be in his forties, wearing a brown suit that looked decades out of date. He was just standing there, staring at the bark of the tree, running his fingers over it like he was reading Braille. There was something about his facial features, the exact movements of his hands. At first, it was just a vague sense of familiarity, and then I felt a spark within me. I felt those same feelings of static I’ve described throughout my life.\n\nSomething about a kid I’d known briefly in the early days of my childhood… his name was Douglas, I’m pretty sure. A third cousin, I think, or maybe a family friend’s son? Or was he some imaginary friend I had? No, he was definitely real, and he was in the family, but he wasn’t a close relative. I saw him maybe twice in my life. My one solid memory of him is from a family gathering when I was six. All the other kids were playing tag, but I found Douglas, who was a few years older than me, sitting alone by the creek. He was meticulously stacking these smooth, grey stones into a perfect, freestanding archway of sorts. Like a little depiction of a skyscraper jutting up from the ground. It was impossibly delicate. When he saw me watching, he didn’t smile. I thought it was cool and impressive, I remember, so I asked him how he’d made it. He just looked at me with these ancient, tired eyes and said, “It’s a door. But you mustn’t open it.” Then, he kicked it over and walked away.\n\nThe man standing underneath that tree was a grown-up version of Douglas. There was no doubt in my mind. I don’t know how I knew; I just knew it.\n\n“Anthony, I slurred, my tongue feeling thick. “Do you see that guy? Under the tree?”\n\nAnthony squinted. “What guy, man? There’s no one there. Hey, dude, constellations. They’re weird. It’s like they’re people in the sky. Or in the things between.”\n\nI didn’t understand what Anthony meant. It felt all wrong. I saw movement in the distance. The man – Douglas – turned his head slowly and looked directly at me. His face was a mask of sorrow so deep it felt geological. Like he wasn’t really a brain behind it all, just pure misery.\n\n*“This isn’t possible,”* I thought, my mind reeling. I realised how little this made sense, even if I was tripping. This couldn’t be Douglas. Douglas had only been a few years older than me as a kid. So this fortyish looking guy obviously can’t be him. And something else. My mom had told me about it years later. This memory took even longer to dredge up. It was the thought of constellations that brough it back to me. I don’t even know where the connection is in that. Douglas had had some mental break at some point, my Mom told me once years ago. He’s been in an institution since he was a teenager. He couldn’t even ne here right now, on top of him not being the right age. So why was my brain constructing all of this?\n\nAs I continued locking eyes with the stranger, as Anthony stared off into space beside me, the internal Anthony-voice answered that last question the second it’d occurred to me. “He’s the devil.”\n\nThe real Anthony was now looking across at me, concerned, asking if I needed to sit down. But in that moment, I knew two things for sure. The voice in my head was absolutely not my friend. And that man under the tree, whether he was Douglas or the devil or both or neither, was certainly real in a way that Anthony, the road, and the trees suddenly didn’t feel like they were. The filter wasn’t just down, it’d been torn off somehow, and I felt I could finally see the static that was there all along, even if I didn’t understand what that really meant.\n\nAnthony decided to call things off then, and we went and got a motel to wait out the rest of the trip, Part of me wanted to forget about everything, to pretend it just never happened or that, like Anthony said, I’d just gotten unlucky and had an awful first trip. But the other part, the part that’s been listening to the hum of the static my whole life, knew that wasn’t an option. The door was open, and I couldn’t just close my eyes on what was inside.\n\nComing down from the trip was like being thrown back into a world made of cardboard after seeing the real scaffolding and foundations underneath. Everything felt thin and fake. Anthony drove me home, freaked out. He was saying, “Dude you were just having a bad trip. Even though it sucks that it was your first time, it happens.” But he wouldn’t look me in the eye.\n\nThe problem is, it didn’t stop when the acid wore off. The filter was gone. Permanently. Now, the static was everywhere.\n\nThe first time it happened, I was making some coffee for myself. I was listening to the background noise of the *drip-drip-drip* of the coffee machine while going to the fridge for the milk. I realised the sound had, somewhere in the background, suddenly sounded unmistakably like the unintelligible voice of someone from long ago in my past. Some girl, I think, some girl called Molly from my elementary school that I hadn’t really been friends with and could barely even remember at first.\n\nI could suddenly make out what her voice was saying as it coalesced into three clear and whispered words before it vanished from my mind right as I’d realised it. And even today I can’t remember the tone of voice or punctuation as she spoke them, just the words themselves.\n\n*Ask your grandpa*\n\nI stood there, frozen, the carton of milk feeling somehow warm in my hand. This could’ve been nothing. It could’ve been exactly like before, just a random intense recognition, just like the moments of static I’d gotten in the past. “Ask your grandpa,” is a perfectly normal phrase in and of itself, after all. And it’s the kind of thing I might have a vague, mostly forgotten memory of someone almost completely irrelevant to my life saying once. And yet I felt sure that it wasn’t just a memory. I felt sure it meant something. That it was an instruction. I felt I had no real choice to make.\n\nSo I went to visit my grandfather. Me and Grandpa Francis have a good relationship. He’s seventy, but his mind is still mostly sharp, no signs of decline. He just gets a little wistful sometimes is all. I meet up with him at his house every few months to have a glass of something and a chat. He lives in a quiet, detached house about an hour away that smells of old books and liniment.\n\nI gave him a call and said I was passing through his neck of the woods and was wondering if he wanted to catch up for a bit. He was more than welcome to it. When I arrived, he ushered me inside as always with a firm handshake. I didn’t know how to bring it all up. I just tried to stay engaged with Grandpa’s initial small talk and questions as he poured us each a glass of Captain Morgan’s spiced gold, before trying to subtly pivot and steer the conversation over. I did the only thing I could think of and asked him casually enough if he had any interesting or weird stories from when he was younger. Grandpa Francis is full of stories, and swapping them is something we’d often do. He got a suddenly distant look in his eyes.\n\n“Well,” he said, and I could almost hear it in his relatively steady voice. Underneath the lazy composure, the sound of the cogs in his head gradually kicking into action.\n\n“There was my old friend Petey. This was back around when we were no older than you are now. Just two guys with everywhere to be and nowhere to go. The two of us, working in the old autoshop all day long. Boy, you remember how it was, amount of times you’ve seen that dump over the years. But I was always happy with how things were. Quiet, you know. No fuss. That’s the life I wanted. But Petey thought there had to be more to the world. More to see, more to feel, more to experience. Always more with that fella. God, Jack, you remember all the stories I’ve told about the road trips, and the hiking, and the folks we’d meet at bars… wouldn’ta happened without Petey. He rattled my nerves to no end but I woulda lived a less full youth without him, no doubt.”\n\nI leaned in. Grandpa had talked about his old friend Petey before. I felt this was going somewhere, but I played it cool. Grandpa took a sip and continued.\n\n“Petey would go exploring when he was free. Exploring the roads, the abandoned houses, everywhere. ‘Specially the woods, the big state park, not far from where that friend of yours lives, actually.” At that, I had to supress a chill.\n\n“Petey was stupid. You hear me? Stupid kid. Always poking his nose where it didn’t belong, hoping he’d find something new. And eventually, he found something alright. Something strange. He took me into the woods one summer day, wanting to show me.\n\n“It was a door,” Grandpa said after a pause. “Just a door, made of old, dark wood, standing all by itself in a clearing. No house, no walls. Just this door. It was in good nick, fresh paint job on there, and the bottom of the doorframe was nailed securely into the topsoil of the ground, so it stood perfectly upright, just like a normal door. Petey, he was always the brave one, he walked right up to it.”\n\nGrandpa paused again, taking a longer sip. The house was silent except for the ticking of the clock. I realised I’d stopped breathing.\n\n“What does that make Petey?” Grandpa asked.\n\n“Stupid,” I answered, trying to force a jokey voice.\n\n“He gets closer and closer to the doorframe, and I’m thinking it’s a bad idea. I’m thinking he’s putting himself in danger. But, I mean, why would I even have thought that? It’s just a door. But it felt all kinds of wrong. Petey’s almost able to reach out and touch the door when it opens up. A man stepped out. Or, well, I suppose he was always standing in that clearing in the woods, behind the door. You wouldn’t call it stepping out of the door so much as walking through it. No way to know which way’s in and which way’s out, right?\n\n“He was dressed in normal enough clothes, but there was something wrong with his eyes. Petey told me later it was like looking into a well that had no bottom. He looked at us, and he had this expression of anguish on his face so profound it was almost alien. And then, his voice, it… it sounded exactly like the voice of someone I could remember, but I don’t know who. There was something about it that had been changed, something made poisonous. The whole clearing smelled like an electrical fire. “It’s worse inside,” he said. Petey fell back and grasped my arm and whispered to me like he just knew it, “He’s all bad.” And he was. We ran all the way home and never spoke of it again,” Grandpa finished. “I knew that day that the Lord works in strange ways, but I wonder sometimes, does the devil work in stranger.” He made the sign of the cross in an unfocused way as he gazed out the window. We both drained our glasses.\n\nI tried to keep myself in check while Grandpa and I carried on having a generally fine chat for the next ten minutes or so. I could tell it was time to leave. Grandpa was more zoned out now than before. We said our goodbyes. I knew why it was. He was brooding. I’d heard about Petey in a good few of Grandpa’s old stories from back in his day. If I was remembering correctly, Petey Jackson had died less than a year after that story Grandpa just told me, when he was around twenty. 1976. The exact details of his death are the only part that Grandpa himself had never actually told me. He’d never needed to. I’d heard it all before, because Petey’s death is still a mystery. I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove home.\n\nPetey vanished one day. After a day’s work at the autoshop, him and Grandpa parted ways as always, but Petey’s family never saw him come home. Only a few hours later, Petey was found naked and dead in a ditch by some teenagers who were out camping a whole state away. Petey didn’t even have a car of his own. Nobody had any idea how he could’ve gotten there on his own.\n\nI only knew about this part from Grandpa Francis, but a few weeks after that, a bartender in our hometown opened up for the day and set about to work one morning as usual before he noticed, in the dusty, barren yard across the road, there was a small, slightly damaged and pitiful looking fridge standing by itself. He\'d no idea who dumped it but wanted to get rid of it, since he thought it was an eyesore. He dropped it on his first attempt, and the door snapped open, spilling its contents. Stuffed inside that fridge had been some of Petey’s clothes, neatly folded and pristine. There were that clothes that didn’t belong to him at all in there too. A deck of weird playing cards, Petey’s baseball bat, and the shed skin of some kind of tarantula. Grandpa told me the bartender just left the fridge in the yard after that. Didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Grandpa called the police himself when he heard about the clothes and baseball bat, but nothing ever came of it. Petey’s death was never solved, and they never found out why his things turned up after the fact in that manner.\n\nWhen I got home, the investigation began. I’m in the process of working through my sociology thesis for my sophomore year of college. I’m used to research. I started digging into local records, old newspaper archives. I wasn’t looking for shit about “the devil” or “strange doors in the woods”. I was looking for patterns. And believe me, I found them. It took many, many hours of digging, but eventually I stumbled upon them.\n\nThe first was an article from 2016 about a boy a few counties away from my area named Douglas Pickman, who, not long after his sixteenth birthday, was committed to a mental institution after being found wandering in that same state park. I’d heard bits and pieces of the story before, though I was shaky on the details, trying to pull at threads I could mostly remember from overheard conversations as a child.\n\nDouglas had seemed disoriented and strange for weeks beforehand, according to his parents. They said he’d been refusing to eat anything that had colour. It was rice, bread, mashed potato and milk every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’d sneak out constantly at night, but there were no signs that he was meeting girls, partying, doing drugs, anything. His grades remained fine, near-perfect, actually.\n\nHe\'d sneak outside and just stand outside his first-floor bedroom window, staring out into the night. Why even bother going outside? By day, when he thought nobody was looking, they’d sometimes see him out on the road leading out from the house, stooping over, staring down into a particular storm drain. They’d heard once from a postman that he’d been whispering things down into the drain. One thing the postman could remember hearing was “I remember I was killing you but it’s all different inside”. Douglas’ friends at school said he’d kept trying to give away his things to them, saying he’d just be throwing them away otherwise. Things they thought he prized, like his signed band t-shirts and magic the gathering cards.\n\nOnce, his dad had heard him skulking about at night and went to investigate. He couldn’t find him in his bedroom or anywhere in the house for that matter. Staring out the window into the night – a terribly stormy one – lightning flashed for a few seconds. In the blue, white-hot light, illuminating momentarily the fields across from their house, he saw Douglas, a hundred feet away, running around carefree, going in and out from behind the many haybales scattered about. When the man got out to his son, he found him lying unconscious on the golden soil. He was wearing different clothes, somehow. Both his parents said they’d never bought or seen them before. They were old school, like 70’s high school style. There was a dead cat on the ground next to him.\n\nOne day he snuck out and never came back. There was a search, and a day later the police found him in those woods of the state park, having climbed up a tree and refusing to come down, claiming he’d “found where it sounds right.” He was violently thrashing a long, rusty nail at any of the officers who tried to pull him down. He was only collected after he’d started bashing his forehead against a thick, jutting stump in the tree branch and dented his skull, falling down onto the ground about ten feet below. He was apparently very lucky to survive and had done permanent damage to his skull.\n\nI suddenly remembered something else as I read – something my mother had mentioned to me years ago when she told me about all of this. The memory was still foggy, but I remembered her telling me something Officer Dell had said to her once. He’s married to a friend of my mom’s, Caroline Dell, so they know each other well enough. According to him, as Douglas fell from the tree, and after he landed before passing out from shock and blunt force trauma, he kept screeching incoherently. “Screeches like a fax machine”, Dell had said. I’ve got no idea what that could mean but it didn’t sound good. And one thing, intelligible in the screeching, over and over. “Where’s the boy?”\n\nDell said he seemed to be staring right at him, and his eyes were like “every pair of eyes he’d ever looked into but different.” And as he stared down at the boy being cuffed, he was startled when the air suddenly reeked of something like an electrical fire. All the other officers denied that detail when he mentioned it afterwards. A few months later, Caroline miscarried their child. As the doctors broke that information to them, Dell said he remembered that exact smell again, seeping into every crack of the maternity ward. He\'s never smelled it again, apparently. They never did end up trying again for a child.\n\nI’d no idea what to make of all this. It was all just strange things I could half-remember hearing about before, suddenly being spurred forward. But I felt sure it meant something, and it was plaguing me. I felt if I could get to the bottom of it all I might understand everything else that’d been happening to me, both as of late and throughout my life. The end of the article mentioned Douglas’ family’s – *my family’s –* long history of “nervous mental conditions”. I’d never heard anything about this before in my life.\n\nI dug deeper. Census records, obituaries, police blotters. A great-uncle of mine I wasn’t aware of who’d vanished on a hunting trip in 1952. A daughter of a *great*\\-grand-uncle who apparently died in a “domestic accident” after neighbours reported her screaming about a man in the attic. It’s all the same. An unnavigable breadcrumb trail of mental breakdowns and inexplicable tragedies, all leading seemingly to nothing, and yet it all felt connected somehow.\n\nIt\'s hard to explain how cagey I was at this time. It was getting more and more invasive to my daily life, too. Like, one time I was walking to my house from the college library where I’d been doing my research, when I saw that there was a dude walking up the street against me. Seemed like another college guy from the backpack and the direction he was headed, towards campus. Way off into the distance – this particular street is long and straight – he’s walking up towards me. As we kept approaching one another, he came more into vision and the guy’s face was now less hazy from the distance, He was starting to look exactly like a guy called Ritchie who’d been in my year back in high school. I hadn’t really been super close friends with him and I never saw much of him after starting college, since he hadn’t had any interest in it and went straight to working at his dad’s autoshop.\n\nThat made this kind of strange. Since Ritchie never went to college to my knowledge, why’d he seem to be going to campus with a backpack? But that was crazy talk. Ritchie – I was certain now it was him – could be going anywhere in this direction, with a backpack, for any reason, right? It’s none of my business. And yet I felt sure there was something to this, something that meant something.\n\nAnd then it got stranger, in a way. As Ritchie and I came even closer to each other, crossing paths at last, I realised I had been wrong, this guy didn’t actually look anything like Ritchie as I remembered him at all. As we fully intersected and crossed paths, I was left wondering what I’d just experienced. Whether this man was or wasn’t Ritchie, what was it about him that’d led my mind to conjuring all that up? He hadn’t actually done anything. As I thought about it, I couldn’t even remember exactly what Ritchie actually did look like. And, come to think of it, where was Ritchie? Did he even work at an autoshop at all? The only one around for miles is the one in my hometown, near Grandpas’ house, that he and Petey worked at.\n\nThis type of strangeness of thought and paranoia had been pervading my life ever since the experience during the acid trip. Little things like this kept cropping up throughout my day to day life, making me momentarily question my sense of self, and as it piled up it all felt both more and more disjointed and ontologically incompatible, and more and more like it was all connected, I just couldn’t work out why or how. It was like there was something truly, utterly terrible hiding somewhere just out of frame in the metaphorical TV screen that I was viewing my memories through.\n\nAnd maybe the more I’d began to remember, defences had been put in place and all these ominous, contradictory threads had been thrown at me. Maybe I was simply not supposed to remembered. I wondered if maybe my salvation was buried deep in my memories, too – what if all I had to do was keep trying to trigger more and more memories, because if I could just remember enough about something, I could get to the bottom of it all and expose whoever was behind it? But then, what would that something even be? And something else had been growing, a feeling that it was all going to be coming to a head soon somehow.\n\nAnthony found me at the campus library. He looked scared. “Jack, you have to stop this shit, bro,” he said, lowering his voice. He sounded the least stoned I’d heard him in a while. “I looked a bit into your family. This whole thing doesn’t feel like, just, a joke, or a weird hallucination or whatever. Everyone like you who’s gone down this thing, they’re gone. They’ve either disappeared or they… they killed themselves. You’re chasing some kind of ghost story that’s still making more.”\n\nI heard his words. I really did. But as he was speaking, the other voice of Anthony, the one from before, the internal one, was smoother, clearer. It didn’t even sound much like Anthony anymore, it was just a calm, neutral tone, but I knew it was the same voice.\n\n*“He is a guardian,”* it said, the voice full of hate and causing flashes in my mind of teeth, of hair, of darkness, spiders, asphalt. *“He keeps the lambs from the pasture.”*\n\nI didn’t tell Anthony what I heard this time. I thanked him for his concern and told him I thought I was getting over it all anyway. Inside my mind, however, the size of the rift that I’d instantaneously felt open up between us was like suddenly getting dropped into the Grand Canyon. I didn’t know what to think about anything anymore.\n\nThe signals were changing. They weren’t just commentary anymore. They’re, they’re *navigational*. Like, yesterday, I was stoned and watching a nature documentary. I hadn’t been to any of my classes or my job for a while. I was trying to put myself into a foggy headspace deliberately now, trying to elicit more and more of the static in my subconscious, hoping it might trigger memories that could reveal more clues to me. I’d been denying myself sleep, deliberately zoning out to music or the TV, getting high non-stop, I’d even been experimenting with binaural beats. As I was zoning out, high, reading some texts on my phone and absorbing the background noise of National Geographic, a generally quiet and easy cacophony had filled the room. Until the sounds from the documentary of flowing water, of rustling leaves, of chirping birds, all tightened, sharpened, and became that same hate-filled voice, like friction on a carpet.\n\n*The map the third drawer the green circle*\n\nI walked over to my desk, my body moving almost on its own. I pulled out the topographical map of the state park I’d picked up at their gift shop while I was driving home from Grandpa’s and all but forgotten about in the drawer. It was tucked into the third drawer. In the deep woodland, where Grandpa’s story had taken place, someone had drawn a small, precise circle in green ink. I don’t even own a green pen. I knew what was in that circle. I didn’t need to check the coordinates against my memories of the acid trip. I just knew. It was all coming together now, I felt. I was going to the woods.\n\nThat brings us to the reason for my post, folks. I’m not looking for answers anymore. I’m just leaving a record. A warning, maybe, for anyone else who hears the signal. Stop reading now, if you’re smart. Go back to your life. Consider the static nothing but.\n\nI went back to the woods. The green circle on the map was a pull I could never resist. The journey wasn’t like the first time with Anthony. There was no laughter, no intoxication, no adventurous feelings. This was like a funeral march. I told no one I was going. The woods were silent in a way that felt intentional, like the birds and the insects were holding their breath. I didn’t need the map at all. My own blood seemed to know the way, pulling me forward like a diving rod tuned to a lucid nightmare. The air grew colder, felt denser. The familiar panicky stutter in my perception I’ve experienced throughout my life was no longer a glitch, here. It was the dominant signal. And then, amongst all the thin birch trees and cracked beams of sunlight dispersing through the canopy overhead, I saw the door.\n\nIt was exactly as Grandpa Francis had described. A simple, freestanding doorframe of dark, weathered wood; no walls or house to be seen. It was just there. It was both the most utterly mundane and the most wrong thing I’ve ever witnessed. The sight of it radiated waves of something bad, just pure bad. There was something inherent to the doorframe, something hidden beneath the atoms in the different materials and components that made up its structure, something lurking within that sent my nervous system into a state or revolt. Something about the doorframe and its presence here violated reality simply by existing.\n\nAs I stood there, maybe ten feet away, the final broadcast from the signal came through. It wasn’t even a voice this time, more like a knowing, a sudden injection of utter truth. A data packet that an unknown force had suddenly downloaded directly into my soul for me. I understood. The door changed me. It changes us. It breaks our filters. When I saw who I felt, impossibly, was Douglas, I think the voice in my head of Anthony was telling the truth. In a way, I think it was. I must have seen the devil. I saw him, who had walked through the doorway and been change. He was perceiving everything like how I felt I could suddenly perceive everything. The weight of time, the memories trapped in the soil, the silent anguish of every living thing for miles. That must’ve been why it called him the devil, I thought desperately. It was the only word big enough to hold the terror.\n\nThe signal, the static, everything, I think it’s what’s on the other side of that filter. It’s the raw data of existence. Beautiful. Entrancing. Labyrinthine. Terrible. Unbearable. Stepping through the door would be to understand everything. To become a clear channel. I would know why Douglas built his stone archways. I would know the name of the woman singing in my fan. I would know what the rocks remember. I would also cease to be Jack. I would be a vessel, overflowing, forever drowning in an ocean, a psychic avalanche of disjointed truths. I stood at the threshold for a long time. I felt the pull.\n\nThe part of me that has always been curious, that has always listened, wanted nothing more than to step forward and finally, finally know. I thought of Anthony’s face then, full of fear. I thought of dead spiders curling up in on themselves. I thought of rusty nails and electrical heat and gnashing teeth and I thought of darkness, and I thought of life. I felt nauseous beyond belief and fell for a second to my knees. I thought of my grandfather, who lived a long, pleasant and normal life apart from one very strange day in the woods, because he’d ran away from this very clearing in them. I thought of the simple pleasure of a family gathering. Of getting high and goofing off with a friend. Of playing sports. Of brewing coffee in the morning. Of having a beer and awkwardly making small talk or catching up with someone.\n\nI made my choice. I turned my back on the door. I didn’t run, I walked. One foot in front of the other, away from the clearing, away from the silence, back towards the world of cardboard and whispers.\n\nI am home now. The world is quiet. The signal is gone.\n\nThat’s the lie I have to tell myself to get through the day. The truth is, the signal isn’t gone, I don’t think. I think I’ve done something permanent to my ability to receive it, whatever it really is. I had to. To survive. It’s like I’ve taken a weed-whacker to my own mind with a psychological scorched-tar policy. I’ve severed the connection and I’ve scarred the landscape.\n\nThe world feels grey. Flat. The colours are muted. Music doesn’t really feel like music anymore, more like an arrangement of notes and beats in an order that’s sonically pleasing to the human brain for whatever evolutionary reason. A joke is just a sequence of information drip-fed to build towards a reveal and punchline. I still laugh, but more in an “oh, that’s clever” kind of way. The deep, intuitive part of me that sometimes just felt sure of certain things is now silent. It’s a numbness that I think I will carry for the rest of my life.\n\nI saw Anthony yesterday. We had a beer. It was a slight bit awkward and stilted. He says I seem better. More grounded. I agreed and it was almost like old times between the two of us, but he doesn’t understand, will likely never understand, that I had to cripple a part of myself forever to achieve this peace.\n\nI am safe. I am sane. I am empty.\n\nThe door is still there in the woods too, of course. And sometimes, in the dead of the night, when the silence is absolute, I can feel the ghost of the static’s hum. A phantom limb of the soul. And I am filled with the most profound anguish and regret, so profound it feels almost alien, not for what I found but for what I had to destroy in myself to get away from it.\n\nDon’t look for the door. If you hear the static’s hum, learn to live with it. The only thing worse than hearing that signal is the silence you have to create to make it stop.', 'Swagemandbagem', 'nosleep', 'https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1omtejf/only_once_have_i_seen_the_door/', 13, 0, '2025-11-03 04:26:16', '2025-11-07 23:40:40');

Or to be spoken of - in such honour or in fashion. Who speaks of these, the ones who grow your potatoes, or tomatoes, or anything that you eat - for the ones who label them, market them and sell them - are more famous. \n\nIt was rainy these days, and the tribals, on account of some respect for the rain - choose to dress up and dance - which sometimes you could see on the hill far away. It was a huge green forest, spreading miles, and above, stood a few beings dancing like they believed the rain was divine or something. Down in the valley villages, we never believed in such things. Not that the rain wasn’t important, or wasn’t as essential to us as to them - but usually, we believed in God rather than rain.\n\nI stood there waiting for the tribals to dance, and catch a glimpse of them. \n\nMaybe you could say it was because everyone always said the tribals came out to dance up over the hill. But no account, to my knowledge, was directly primary. No one had seen the tribal dance with their eyes. But apparently, many details of the dance were already available to us. Especially the fact that the dance was performed when it rained. The current drizzly weather, with cool fresh breeze emerging from the green all around - seemed perfect for this. \n\nAll of a sudden, the breeze turned a little grey, a little waxy. I heard a certain unusual rumbling coming from somewhere behind me. I looked back, only to see a white government car reaching up to me. I gave way, but shifting to one side of the road. The car stopped near me, and the driver began rolling down the window.\n\n“Where’s the village?”, he said, in a stern, bold voice.\n\nThe man was stout, fat and balding - but unusually pale for an Indian; he looked well-dressed, but not as much as the man in the seat behind. I hadn’t noticed him at first, but I caught a glimpse when the windows rolled down.\n\n“Not up here.” I said. The village didn’t have roads and wasn’t connected to it.\n\nThe man in the back gave a grunt and dabbed his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief. He said calmly, “Turn around” \n\nAnd the car went back. The tribals were not visible, like always, and I had to get back to the village before sunset too, so I started walking in their direction. And soon the little white ambassador was far from sight, like a speck of white dust in a huge backdrop of green. \n\nThe birds too were getting back to their nest in huge flocks - the crows being particularly visible. As evening began to creep, all animals began to retreat back into the jungles.\n\nAs I reached the village, I saw the village children playing in the mud. I couldn’t help but remember my own fun times. Back in the days, we played all day, and were almost always in pure joy. these children were the same. They made a circle in the mud with a stick, and danced on the edge of this circle. Their dance comprised of a sequence of moves, from the lifting of arms, to the bending and jiggling of the ass and then a step taken in front. The children were all aligned in the circle, and would giggle to deaths when the jiggling move came up. Apparently they copied the tribal dance as the village elders had described to them a few months back. \n\nThe village elders gathered around the banyan tree, holding their white loincloths up to their knees, and seated with back straights, the women chatting and gossiping, occasionally letting out a roar of laughter when one of them ended their monologue, all were very common scenes in our village. The children dancing were always bare-chested and were just boys. The girls actually used to sit separately, somewhere near their own mothers, grandmothers and aunts, watching them closely and making a sort of mini-gossip group. It’s not like the girls wouldn’t have liked to mimic the dance; but somehow they never got the approval to do so. \n\nThe village elders looked at me as I passed them and one of them screamed, “Binsu! Come here!”. Well, I didn’t have a choice but to go to them. If I didn’t, I could be certain that my marriage wouldn’t take place because of these *buddhas* ostracising me. I went slowly, looking as stern and busy as possible. I greeted them with a smile. The elders looked at me, and laughed. I was confused. \n\nI scratched my head. “What happened?”\n\nNattu, the village eldest and the *Sarpanch* said, “Your face is weird as ever! Funny man!”. Nattu then adjusted his *dhoti*, which began to touch the muddy ground.\n\nI first let these last-lifes have a last-laugh. Then, I replied, “Nattu Kaka, Don’t laugh so hard, your *dhoti* will fall off, old man!” Everyone, except Nattu, began to laugh. Nattu was visibly reddened, and he murmured “I’ll show him when the time comes”. I said, “Anyways, I gotta go now, I’ll take your leave”. And I left as quickly as possible, to prevent Nattu from getting a last minute comeback.\n\nI bought some onions from Boghu’s shop near my house. Boghu was very unlike Nattu Kaka - he was really dusky, just like his mother - and very muscular. He was clean shaven and a really nice person - never got angry, or jealous and was very timid in behaviour. Boghu was the son of Nattu Kaka, who was disowned because of an inter-caste marriage, so there was always a friction between them in the village - but both were largely respectable in the village. We were in the same school, and I even knew his wife actually. Somehow we weren’t very close in childhood, but he had become a good friend now. I sit with him every alternate evening and chat with him at his shop. There aren’t many avenues for men to chat and release stress - unlike the elderly, women or children. \n\nI had already boiled some rice for lunch, so I just ate some rice and onions. Then I put off my lantern and got ready to sleep. In this monsoon season, moss often grew on your back when you slept, so I had to apply oil on the floor before I slept on it. I took a few drops of mustard oil and smeared it on the red mud floor and carefully placed my back on it. Soon, I was asleep.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning, a commotion awoke me. As I hurriedly got up and peeked outside the door, a few men were gathered around by the villagers. I joined the crowd, to see that the same man and driver, who I’d given directions to, were standing in the centre of this perplexity. \n\nThe driver waved his hands wildly. “It’s a S-U-R-V-E-Y and not a Sherbet. There’s no sherbet here! Nobody’s distributing sherbet! Get back!” \n\nClearly, this had no effect on the villagers, who were determined to get their sherbet from the Officers. \n\nThe driver continued, “This is the District Magistrate! Go back!” And hearing the word DM was enough to push the villagers a little back, only for Nattu kaka to emerge in front. \n\nI ignored all of this, and went back to my house. A neem tree grew near my house, and no one claimed it, so I did. I took a small branch, and began chewing on it, behind the house. Suddenly, a man came up to me saying Nattu Kaka has called me. I went to front of the house again.\n\nNattu Kaka suddenly grabbed my shoulder and said, “Go with these officers up to the hill and show them where the tribals live. You’re always so fascinated about them”. I really had no intention of doing this, and I bypassed Nattu Kaka and called on the Driver, “Will I get paid?” I made this weird expression with my hands indicating counting of money, which in hindsight could be termed disrespectful - but I got away with it. The Driver nodded, flashing his bald head.\n\nAnd I agreed immediately. \n\nThe Driver explained later that the DM and a doctor from a nearby village needed directions to the top of the hill where the tribals lived. I had never seen the tribals, and I’m sure nor did the DM or his driver or the doctor - but I could guide them at least.\n\nI explained the kind of things they would need for the trek - water bottles, bag packs, some food till evening, a match, some oil and a torch. I waited in the \n\n Panchayat Office and stared at the vast paperwork they possessed. I wondered what was this paperwork of - since they hardly ever did any work, Nattu Kaka and others. Actually the paperwork was more useful to the children. The waste copies were stolen by the village children to make notebooks for their schools. the school headed by a weak headmaster - very passionate, I must say - but nobody cared for him and his passion. I suggested them to get the stuff procured from  Boghu’s *kirana* shop. Boghu gave me a cut for every such recommendation. \n\nThe officers got the stuff - hopefully from Boghu - and we were off.\n\nAs we went up the hill, the sun began to shine above our heads, and realising I had forgotten to tell the Officers to bring a towel to cover their head in the noon heat - I gave up mine for the DM. I didn’t even need it at this point - it was more of a habit. The entire journey was mostly a monologue of the Driver - about really random stuff - sometimes his favourite Bollywood actresses, sometimes the reason behind the colour of the sky and sometimes his mother’s knee operation. I wondered how the DM could handle such a nuisance, the driver was. However, the highlights of the trek up definitely were the DM getting sick and vomiting, and the driver panicking because of this, and more because the water seemed to get over. The Driver kept a lot quiet after this overt gesture of puking demonstrated by the DM.\n\nI kept a watch for the tribals, and even a single sighting would be enough for these guys, I thought to myself. I was leading the way, and the trail kept getting narrower. A few nicely arranged stones here and there threw me off and I was about to give a false alarm of a sighting - but I reminded myself that these Officers would probably need something more tangible as evidence. They probably wanted to actually meet a tribal. i hadn’t done it myself after so many years - and one fine day, these 3 idiots want to do it. I chuckled. I gave a quick look to make sure they were there.\n\nI caught a glimpse of the doctor getting tired. I offered him to take some rest. However, the doctor was exceptionally quiet, and too blank, to be fair. In fact, I can’t even remember his voice, until the very end when we did find the bones of the tribals. \n\nYes - the tribals were dead - and the doctor hypothesised a disease, whose name I can’t even pronounce - to be the cause of their deaths. The doctor was saying that the disease would have been so deadly, that it was impossible for the tribals to have not been all killed. But there was a certain hesitation in his voice - some words that seemed left inside his stomach. I noticed it, but the others didn’t - so I ignored it.\n\nIt was getting dark - and too late to actually find these bodies. I suggested we descend back, which was the majority opinion before I had to say it. \n\nDownhill was easier. We were back before midnight and Nattu Kaka was waiting eagerly for us at the Panchayat Office. I was going to go with them into the Office, when the driver suddenly stooped me and coldly said, “Thanks! I think we’re done here.” Something private, I thought to myself. Who cared? I had collected my payment as advance before the trek, so I wanted to go back home. But something in me - something patriotic - maybe as a citizen of the country or just this curiosity to know - begged me to hide behind the tree near the Office window to eavesdrop. I wanted to evade this persuasion - but I gave in. I slowly circled behind the office, and lead my ear to focus completely on the noises from the building.\n\nNattu Kaka’s voice shook. “But they’re all dead!”\n\nThe driver replied, “Yes, we know. But the tribal welfare funds will stop coming if we declare them dead!”\n\nThere was a pause. The Driver continued, “I understand your concern, but nobody will catch this. The DM is right here with us. We will reward you with a share too.”\n\nAfter some more resistance, Nattu Kaka gave in. I could hear some ruffling of some papers. The Driver tapped the paper sharply. “Sign here. Write “ALL HEALTHY” in capital letters.” The doctor made no sound, at least none I could hear.\n\nYou would think my blood would boil or I would be angry at these open scene of corruption. But not really. I didn’t care much. I went back to my home, and soon the officers were gone. I bought a soda from Boghus shop later in the evening with my money, and enjoyed my evening. The village elders, except Nattu Kaka, were still there laughing. The women still gossiping and the children dancing weirdly in red mud. \n\nAs I sipped the soda, I saw a small child, bare-chested and brown, covered in mud walk with confidence with a sheet of paper in his hand. There was a yellow pencil stuck behind his ears, the same kind he had seen from in the Office. I wanted to tease the kid and snatched the paper from him - giving his head a little *tapli* in the back. I saw that it was a copy - of the Tribal Welfare Report, signed by Nattu Kaka and those Officers. The kid snatched it back and ran away. I didn’t go after him. Well it was his notebook - do what he may with it now.\n\nThe child went to the gravelled road, and walked for a few minutes with stern determination and a bold look. It began to drizzle lightly. The birds began to chirp, the animals made their sounds and evening came up - as if rehearsed by nature. Behind the setting sun, in the black clouds, the hill looked beautiful. A small streak of smoke emanated from a tiny orange flame on the hill. And on close inspection, the child saw the tribals dancing around the bonfire. Loud, powerful and angry - in rhythmic vibrations from the throat and mysterious dancing in a circle. \n\nThe child took out his pencil and wrote on the paper he had procured - in small letters next to the “ALL HEALTHY”, almost illegibly,  \n\n\\- “and all happy.” ', 'Aditya_Nirmale', 'story', 'https://reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ofcafs/to_see_the_dance/', 2, 2, '2025-10-25 05:10:43', '2025-11-07 23:40:40'),

Maggie and their friends must have descended behind the wall. Joey and the rest of the puppeteers must have congratulated her on her first day as an actor. Dorian—Dory, she had to remember he wanted to be called that—must have grabbed her in a smothering hug after he called it a wrap. She must have returned it.\n\nShe didn’t remember any of it. When she began to sing with Maggie, holding herself together with small-town hunger and grit, she had gone somewhere else. Something else—someone else had taken over her. Someone better.\n\nWhen she came back to her body, Sandra was in the middle of another performance. This time, the venue was Saint Beatrice’s United Methodist Church. The network had decided she had to go to Mama’s funeral after all. The public relations department had insisted. The network couldn’t chance a scandal so early on in their newest talent’s career. They had even sent Caroline along to keep their eyes on Sandra and make sure she made it back to set within 24 hours.\n\nSandra reminded herself that she only had to get through the song. At the reading of the will, Attorney Pruce had told her and her father that one of her mother’s final wishes was for Sandra to sing her favorite song at her funeral. At least Sandra wouldn’t have to learn a new piece. Mama had sung this one to hear every night before bed.\n\nSitting in the hard wooden pew where she had spent every Sunday morning as a girl, Sandra thought of all the lessons she had learned in the small sanctuary under the eyes of Brother Joel and the beautiful dead man on the stained-glass cross.\n\nMake sure the hem of your skirt never rises above your knee.\n\nNever ruin a conversation with talk of unpleasant things.\n\nSmile kindly when a deacon’s eyes linger on you a little too long.\n\nSmile kindly when Brother Joel starts to scream about you and everyone you love burning in hell for eternity.\n\nAlways smile kindly.\n\nAnd, most importantly, do all the good you can for all the people you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can. No matter what.\n\nShe tried to keep her mind on that last commandment as she watched her black heels walk up the thick blue carpet of the stairs. Singing this song was what Mama wanted. It was doing good. She was commanded to do it.\n\nThe smell of charring salt on fresh fried chicken from the kitchen behind the stage brought her back to Mama’s kitchen in their little white house. She looked down into the casket and saw her mother in an old-fashioned rose pink cotton dress. The funeral director had painted the makeup on her corpse with a precision that she would have appreciated. Looking down at her mother, Sandra hoped she was finally happy. Not just smiling, but happy.\n\nIn the moments before Dr.  Jo, her old piano teacher started the song, Sandra felt the eyes burning her skin again. There were only a few dozen people in St. Bee’s on this Tuesday morning, but Sandra’s heart pounded like she was in the center of the Coliseum. Her father and Caroline, the two people she most needed to please, were in the front pew staring up at her with expectation. Everyone in the church was waiting for her to do good. Her head reeled at the thunder of Dr. Jo’s cough and the earthquake of Brother Joel opening a peppermint. By instinct, she looked towards her mother.\n\nShe was gone. Maggie was lying in the casket instead. Dr. Jo played the first lilting notes of “The Rainbow Connection,” and Sandra went away again.\n\n**2024**\n\nThe next day was more of what had become Mikey’s normal. He woke up at 7:55 to Bree’s compulsory good morning and text-message briefing. He left for the firm at 8:50. He tried to enjoy being a lawyer while he still could. Then he left for the campaign at exactly 5:00.\n\nHe turned right off of Main and left onto Reading. Coming to a stop sign, Mikey wished he could take the ramp to the interstate and leave town. He could hang another shingle in another small town—maybe Redford or Gaynor. That’s all he had ever wanted to do: practice law and help people. He knew that winning this campaign would mean going into politics as a career and leaving the law behind for good.\n\nDriving down Reading towards Highway 130, Mikey remembered that he had at least been able to take a new client that day. Dr. Wei Tate, the family doctor who had seen Bree and Mikey their whole lives and seen their parents even before then, was finally retiring. Mikey was happy for Dr. Tate. The old man certainly deserved to rest.\n\nMikey only wished he was doing something to help Dr. Tate instead of representing Quality Care, the regional hospital chain that was buying out the old doctor’s clinic in an offer he couldn’t refuse. Mikey had read about how hospital monopolization hurt small towns like Dove Hill, but their grand opening would bring dozens of new jobs and a guaranteed ribbon-cutting. Mikey told himself it was the greater good. Even if it wasn’t, Quality Care’s offer to start a financial relationship with a rising star politician was one that Bree couldn’t let him refuse.\n\nLost in dreading work on the Quality Care acquisition, Mikey realized he had arrived at the publicist’s office. Set as close to the town line as it could be, the building looked ashamed to be in a place like Dove Hill. It wouldn’t have been within the municipal limits but for a favor the construction company’s owner owed Mayor LeBlanc. Mikey wasn’t sorry for the distance. The building’s ostentatiously corporate aesthetic would definitely have disrupted the streets where he grew up.\n\n“Walking in,” Mikey texted Bree. Bree responded with a question mark.\n\nPassing the two-story’s unnecessary stainless-steel elevators, Mikey walked to the end of the entrance hall and took the stairs. He found the publicist’s office at the end of the hall that smelled like fresh ink and cold paper. The glass of the door was frosted and printed with “SCARNES AND BLUMPH” in large red letters.\n\nMikey entered a small overwhelmingly white lobby with a kind looking older lady sitting behind the desk. Her name plate read “Mary Ann.” Mikey approached her. “Hi there,” he smiled. She smiled back a bit surprised, like she had not been spoken to in some time. “Excuse me. I’m here for a meeting with Mr. Scarnes.”\n\n“Of course,” she answered. It seemed like she was happy to have something to do. “Right this—”\n\nBefore Mary Ann could stand all the way up, Ryan Scarnes entered with the energy of a used car dealer. Without so much as acknowledging Mary Ann, Ryan reached out to shake Mikey’s hand. It was a demand. “Well hello, Mr. Dobson. Welcome to our humble abode.” Mikey glanced at Mary Ann who was already back in her chair as though she had never moved.\n\n“Hi,” Mikey said while feeling his hand reach to meet Ryan’s. Mikey knew it was the right thing to do, but he thought his hand might leave the shake coated in grime. Despite Ryan’s clearly tailored suit, razor-straight teeth, and stone-set hair, Mikey couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something filthy about him. “I’m Mikey Dobson. Nice to meet you. Thank you for meeting with me today.”\n\nRyan looked down at Mary Ann. “Mary Jane, would you please get Mr. Dobson a sparkling water in a champagne flute?” Mikey didn’t bother to mention that he didn’t drink sparkling water. Turning back to Mikey, Ryan forced a laugh. “It’s a little early for champagne, but we can pretend.”\n\nRyan walked back down the hallway where he had emerged while continuing his monologue. Mikey assumed he was supposed to follow. When they reached the large conference room stuffed with as many mirrors and gilded paperweights as Ryan Scarnes’s idea of taste would allow, Bree was poring over a table covered in pictures of Mikey.\n\n“Hey sis,” Mikey ventured.\n\n“Hi,” Bree said, partially looking up from the oversized conference table. In the second she turned her eyes to him, Mikey saw that same flash of warmth.\n\n“Good to see you…again,” Mikey joked while opening his arms for a hug.\n\nBree responded with a polite laugh and a reach for a more professional welcome. “You too. How long has it been? 21 hours?” Of course she knew the precise time.\n\nSinking into one of the gold-trimmed leather chairs, Mikey thought that Bree and Ryan looked like the actual politicians. Bree in her dark gray pantsuit and Ryan in his bespoke charcoal coat and glaring red tie. He laughed at himself as he looked down at his department store slacks and wholesale button-down.\n\n“Now where were we, Ms. Dobson?” Ryan asked with a humility that almost broke under the weight of pretense.\n\nBree seemed not to notice. She seemed not to notice a lot about Ryan Scarnes. In her mind, the campaign was all too fortunate to have signed with a publicist as young, tenacious, and data-loaded as him. She promised Mikey that Ryan’s discounted prices were worth the implicit promises of access she had made on Mikey’s behalf.\n\n“We were just reviewing the options for the final mailer,” Bree reported.\n\n“Right. Our focus group suggested that they liked seeing Mikey outdoors. They said it made him look approachable, friendly. You’ll see the outdoor shots in the top-left quadrant.”\n\nAs Ryan and Bree walked to the other side of the table, Mary Ann gently entered the room. She was like a friendly mouse: eager to help but afraid to be seen.\n\n“Here you go, sweetie,” she cooed to Mikey.\n\n“Thanks, Ms. Mary Ann. I appreciate it. I’m Mikey by the way. How’s your day—”\n\n“That’ll be all,” Ryan interrupted. He looked at Mary Ann like she had been caught.\n\n“Yes, Mr. Scarnes.” Mary Ann and Mikey exchanged a smile as she snuck back out the door.\n\nBree and Ryan continued to talk about Mikey. Or at least about the face in the gallery. Ryan had done his job once again and made Mikey unrecognizable to himself. They examined every picture on the table as if it were a unique masterpiece with hidden details in every inch. Mikey just saw the man he didn’t know. In one, the man was sitting on a bench. In another, he was standing in front of a tree. In another, he was leaning on a brick wall. The only thing Mikey especially liked about the pictures was that they were all taken around the Mason County Courthouse.\n\n“I’m torn between the ones standing in front of the doors and the ones sitting on the steps,” either Bree or Ryan said. They had both long since forgotten Mikey was in the room.\n\nMikey felt their conversation grew louder and louder as it went on. It grew from a business transaction into a cable news debate. Looking at all of the photos of the man who was not him, he felt his breath catch in his chest. “Who is this?” he thought. His head began to spin into lightness. “It’s not me.” He wanted to scream. That would have been inappropriate.\n\nInching his eyes up and down the rows of pictures of the other him, Mikey caught something strange in the corner of his eye. In one of the pictures on the courthouse steps, Mikey saw something in a bright shade of blue. Not the cautious blue of a politician’s tie. The rich, glowing blue of a gemstone.\n\nMikey stood from his seat and leaned over to the picture with the blue presence. He saw it. Sitting over his shoulder on the white concrete steps was a smiling blue turtle. The turtle sat like a small child with its legs out in front and its eyes looking straight at Mikey. Mikey couldn’t tell if the turtle’s eyes were looking at the him in the conference room or the him on the courthouse steps. But they were looking. Watching. The turtle’s smile was stretched so far that it looked like its felt was going to rip at the seams.\n\nMikey didn’t know how he knew the turtle was made of felt. He just did. He also knew it’s—his name was Tommy and that he liked trains. Mikey had met Tommy before. But it hadn’t been at the courthouse. No one had been there except for Mikey, Bree, and Ryan. Mikey remembered that because, despite his silent objections, Bree and Ryan had convinced the city judge to end court early that afternoon.\n\nLooking into Tommy’s eyes, Mikey felt two conflicting emotions. His panic continued to build. He knew that turtle had not been at the courthouse that day. Why were his eyes telling him otherwise? But he also felt a sense of peace. Even though Tommy’s eyes were watching both Mikeys like they were afraid he would stop smiling, Mikey somehow felt like Tommy was an old friend. Like they had played together as kids.\n\nBefore Mikey could decide what he was supposed to feel, Ryan turned his schmooze away from his conversation with Bree. “You have good tastes, Mr. Dobson. Ms. Dobson and I were just deciding to use one of the courthouse steps pictures on the mailer.”\n\n“Yeah, sounds good,” Mikey said without turning away from Tommy.\n\nRyan turned back to Bree. “Now just to decide which one.”\n\nWhile Bree and Ryan carefully discussed which of the nine seemingly identical photos to use, Mikey carefully picked up the one with Tommy. When he looked at it more closely, Tommy was gone. If Bree or Ryan noticed one of their pictures missing, they didn’t show it as they continued their deliberations.\n\nFolding the picture and placing it into his shirt pocket, Mikey noticed a new sensation. Pressing against his skin, the picture felt warm. It was a comforting heat—a log fire at Christmas. But it was also narrow and pointed—an eye staring through his heart.\n\n**\\***	**\\***	**\\***\n\nBy the time Bree ended the meeting at Scarnes and Blumph, Mikey had convinced himself to forget the burning in his shirt pocket. His skin felt it, but he decided he didn’t. Following Bree’s car back into town, he could only think about Tommy. How did he know the too-friendly turtle? And how had he *seen* him?\n\nMikey was reassuring himself of his senses when he and Bree pulled up to Delano Plaza, one of the several strip malls that had risen from Dove Hill’s ground during the early 2000s. They got out of their cars and met each other in front of China Delight. Their town’s sit-down dining options had dwindled to not much more than a handful of nearly identical Chinese buffets.\n\nMikey appreciated Bree making the time on his schedule for this. Every Tuesday since they had moved back home after school up north, the Dobson siblings had kept the standing commitment. During these weekly dinners, they tried to avoid talking about work. Or politics. Or anything “real,” as Bree had put it. When the campaign started, Mikey made her promise to keep their sibling dinners sacred. He wondered if she could with only weeks to the election.\n\nBree followed Sue Lee, the restaurant’s newest waitress, through the winding path to the back of the building. Sitting the Dobsons at a table next to a wall strewn with red and yellow lanterns, Sue Lee asked about their parents. Bree confirmed that they were doing fine. As Sue Lee handed Mikey the menu that no one ever read, he asked her how she liked working at China Delight. She said it was a job. Still, Mikey was happy for her. He had known Sue Lee in her harder times in high school.\n\nAfter they made their plates of fried chicken, fried rice, and fried donuts, Mikey attempted small talk. That had never been the Dobson family’s gift.\n\n“So have you heard from mom and dad?”\n\n“Yeah,” Bree said with all the care of someone saying they had seen that afternoon’s episode of *Judge Judy*. “Mom texted—either last week or the week before. She asked how you were.”\n\nBetween sips from his oversized red cup, Mikey looked at her with expectation and mild dread.\n\n“Don’t worry. I told her you were fine. She said that dad said to make sure you were keeping up at the firm. Still not sure why I’m always the messenger.”\n\n“You know how they are. Honestly, though, I’m glad they text you and not me.” Mikey wished he meant that. It was one of those technical truths that their dad had taught him to use to avoid making anyone uncomfortable. Truthfully, Mikey would have loved to feel his phone vibrate with a text from his mom. But ever since spring of his senior year, and everything that had happened, his parents’ words to him had faded from well-meaning smothering to benign silence.\n\n“You’re welcome,” Bree smirked. Mikey knew she was only half joking. Even when they were kids, Bree had taken care of him. When their mother scolded him for using the wrong fork for salad, Bree would change the conversation to her recent science fair win. When their father had had too much wine and soap-boxed about the wrong kind of people coming to Dove Hill, Bree would distract everyone by playing “Clair de Lune” for the twenty-second time. As they blew the powdered sugar off their donuts, Mikey realized he had never told Bree how he felt.\n\n“Really though, thanks,” he said. Bree paused with dough in her mouth and looked at him like he had spoken Welsh.\n\n“For?”\n\nMikey hesitated as he worked to express something “real.” He laughed to himself when he saw the bit of dough sitting in Bree’s mouth. He hadn’t seen her that unpolished in years.\n\n“Oh, no,” Bree said, laughing and finally swallowing. “I’m not paying again this week. You’re the fancy attorney after all.”\n\n“No,” Mikey stammered. He mentally smacked himself for ruining the fun and tried to find the words he had lost. He needed to say this. “It’s just… You’ve always taken care of me. Especially with mom and dad. I appreciate it.”\n\nHe could tell he had struck a nerve. Bree Dobson didn’t like to receive gratitude. At least she didn’t think she did. It felt unwieldy.\n\n“Well, you can start paying me back by ordering me a beer.” Looking at his sister, Mikey knew that was the best he was going to get. Bree was her mother’s daughter after all.\n\nMikey turned his eyes towards the ceiling in an attempt to escape the awkwardness that had come to sit with them. He noticed the television sitting in the far corner.\n\nPointing towards it, he asked, “Do you remember watching TV on Saturday mornings? When mom and dad were on their weekends in the country?” Mikey had always loved those weekends. “I can’t believe our eyes didn’t fall out from staring at the screen that long.”\n\n“Those were good days. Not exactly how I remember them though.”\n\n“What do you mean? We would watch TV. And eat our weight in sugary cereal. And—” He stopped. He could tell Bree was forcing a smile now. It was the polite thing to do. “Hey…what’s wrong?”\n\n“Nothing,” she lied. “It’s just…I’m glad you were happy. But for me, those days were for cleaning the house for mom.”\n\nMikey went quiet with a guilt he couldn’t name. He had forgotten about it, but Bree was right. While he was watching cartoons, Bree was doing the chores for the whole family. “You…you could’ve asked me. I would’ve helped you.”\n\n“I know,” Bree said with a proud smile. “I know you would have. But I wanted you to be a kid. To be happy. I was happy to help.”\n\nSeeing the faintest hint of longing in his sister’s dimples, Mikey felt the burning on his chest again. Sue Lee brought Bree her two-bit beer. Even on a supposed night off, Bree was minding the money. The heat rising in his pocket, Mikey remembered the picture. And Tommy.\n\n“Do you remember me watching a show called *Sunnyside Square*?” The burning stopped, but Mikey didn’t notice. He was onto something.\n\n“No. But honestly, you watched so much TV that it would be a miracle if I remembered any of it. You would even wake up before I did to start. And that was an achievement even before I started Adderall.”\n\nMikey kept thinking out loud. “I think it was like a puppet show… Hand puppets maybe?”\n\n“Well, I may not remember what shows you *did* watch, but I know it wasn’t that. I never saw anything but cartoons. I tried to turn on a science show for you once, and you asked where the talking animals were.”\n\nMikey paused. Describing *Sunnyside Square* to his sister, he remembered more and more. It still wasn’t much, but he *knew* he had watched a show called *Sunnyside Square*. He remembered seeing the blue turtle sitting on a brick wall: the brick wall from his dream. His mind felt like there was someone else there. Someone he loved—but didn’t know.\n\n“Really? I remember puppets I think? And always feeling…happy…”\n\nIt was more than that. Mikey couldn’t see *Sunnyside Square*, but he could feel it. He had felt lost so often as a kid—and as an adult. He had felt left behind when his parents went to the cabin and Bree went to work. But, when he would watch that show, it felt like home. He always felt seen.\n\n“Must have been some show,” Bree teased, taking a sip from her bottle. “But yeah, I’m sure I don’t remember it. It was cartoons or…well, different cartoons.”\n\nNo. Sunnyside Square was something better than cartoons. Something real. *Someone* real. With that thought, Mikey remembered. Her name was Sunny Sandy. She was perfect.\n\n**\\***	**\\***	**\\***\n\nMikey wanted to drive straight home. Instead, he tried to finish the sibling dinner as normally as possible. He read his fortune from the freshly stale cookie, paid Sue Lee a 25% tip, gave Bree an awkward hug, and then rushed back to his apartment going as fast as he could without speeding.\n\nHe didn’t stop to undress when he got home. He pulled his laptop from his bag and sat at his desk. He couldn’t stand to lose any glimpse of Sandy’s face in his memory.\n\nThen he realized he had no idea what to search. All he knew was the name Sunny Sandy and the title *Sunnyside Square*.\n\nSearching “Sunny Sandy” led to a handful of beach-focused social media models and a few cloyingly cute children’s books about a yellow cat. He spent what felt like an hour looking through the results only to learn that both the models and the smiling cat in the books looked almost desperately “sunny.”\n\nSearching “Sunnyside Square” at least brought up places, but none were the park that hauntingly graced his dreams. He wondered why a name that was anything but subtle had been used for everything from parking garages to a neighborhood in Cambodia. Still, trying to find anything that would lead him to *his* Sunnyside Square, he spent an hour—or two—three?—working through every turn on the phrase he could think of.\n\nPausing for a breath, he looked at the clock in the corner of his screen. 1:52. He had to be back on the campaign trail in a little over six hours for the first of his morning meet-and-greets. He needed to rest. He was going to face a firing line of voters all wanting a piece of him in exchange for their ballot. He could already feel the exhaustion. He felt the dread in his bones. The guilt in his marrow.\n\nThen it came to him. The words that Sunny Sandy used to start every episode of the show. “Welcome to Sunnyside Square—where the sun can never stop shining!” He had always been struck by that phrase. Not “where the sun always shines” or even “where it’s always sunny.” Sandy said the sun could *never stop shining*. He didn’t know whether that inspired him—or petrified him.\n\nHe typed “where the sun can never stop shining” into the search engine. This time there were zero results. If Mikey ever allowed himself to feel anger, he would have felt it then. He had been so sure that that was the one. Standing from the thrifted office chair, he walked to his kitchenette. He wasn’t hungry after all the fried rice, but he wanted to consume.\n\nReaching towards his dusty counter for the hard candy he had taken on the way out of China Delight, Mikey found an invitation in the dark. After seeing what his father had become, he never drank alcohol, but a corporate client had recently given him a bottle of what Bree had told him was bottom-of-the-barrel red wine. He had wanted to throw it away, but it was a polite gesture. Looking at the glass reflecting the moonlight, Mikey decided he had earned a drink. He was working hard—for Dove Hill, for his parents, for Bree, even for Ryan Scarnes. He was happy to do it, he reminded himself. It was his job. This would make it easier.\n\nHe took the bottle back to his desk and took a long drink. He almost spit it out, but he was supposed to like it. Lifting his hand to close his laptop, he noticed it. He figured the search results had refreshed while he was picking his poison. There was one result now. “Keep On the Sunny Side.” A PDF file with the URL https://www.dovehilldaily.com/news/1999/alwaysonthesunnyside. He clicked it.\n\nA black-and-white scan of a newspaper clipping appeared, pinched and pulled in strange places. Whoever had scanned it was shaking. The distortion made him think of the screeching scrapes of a dial-up. He started to read. *SANDY MAKES GOOD.* He trembled and told himself it was from excitement. He took another drink.\n\nRight below the title and the byline, surrounded by faded text, was a picture. It was her. She was on a stage receiving a bouquet of flowers and a sash that said “Miss Mason County.” She held a friendly-looking puppet at her hourglass side. A dairy cow. He couldn’t be sure through the grayscale, but her ballgown looked pink—almost electric. Her hair was a lighter gray than the rest of the picture.\n\nMikey’s mind flashed with memory. On TV, she always kept her hair in a stone-stiff blonde beehive. Here, it was natural and flat. Her face was the brightest part. She was happy, or at least she was trying to be. In the caption, the journalist nicknamed her “Sunny Sandy.”\n\nMikey drank more of the cheap wine and kept reading. The article said that the woman was Sandra Alan. When she was in community college, she had won Miss Macon County and a scholarship to finish her degree in elementary education at the state school. The cow in the picture was her talent: Maggie the Magenta Moo Cow. On the day the article was published—June 22, 1999—her mother had just told the editor that Sandra and Maggie’s show *Sunnyside Square* had been picked up by the National Television Network. They wanted 20 episodes. Sandra had been in Los Angeles for 5 years, and she had finally caught her dream.\n\nMikey remembered it all. *Sunnyside Square* was about a girl named Sunny Sandy and her multi-colored menagerie of farm animal friends. One was Maggie, the cow from the picture. She always sang a song when the mail came. Another was the turtle from the picture: Tommy the Turquoise Turtle. Every episode, Sandy would help one of the animals learn how to be sunny. Whether they were sad, angry, tired, hungry, or hurt, Sandy fixed them.\n\nMikey had loved the show. He felt like Sandy understood him in a way that no one in the real world did. She knew that all he wanted to do was make people happy.\n\nMikey looked at her smile again. Even reduced to black and white, it felt like looking directly into the sun. Then he looked at her eyes. They looked at the audience—at him—like an old friend lost in time. Like a ghost who knew his name and saw him too clearly. Mikey finished the bottle and fell asleep.\n\n**\\***	**\\***	**\\***\n\nThat night, he dreamed of the park again. This time, he was *in* the park. The benches were still white, but they weren’t polite any more. They were like still specters surrounding him—their frames carved from bone. The trees were still green, but they had spread beyond ominous. Their branches formed cages in the air. And the wall—the wall that Mikey finally remembered Sandy and Tommy and Maggie playing on—looked like its bricks had been dyed in blood. Even through his sleep, Mikey felt relief when the park faded into pink. Then the drowning started again.', 'JLKeay', 'libraryofshadows', 'https://reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1oq0v13/sunnyside_square_tuesday/', 3, 0, '2025-11-06 21:47:57', '2025-11-07 23:40:41');

The Red Team would return to the dorms, feeling the weight of Wanda’s elimination. Though Ruben says in his confessional that it was for her own good anyways, before scratching that, and clarifying it was for the good of the Red Team, so it’s not like it’s a huge loss… He’d boldly mention that with the weakest link gone, they can finally start winning, but Henri does remind him that with attitude, he might need to tone it down, because cockiness does get somewhere not excellent. Though Ruben does tell the ‘old man’ that he may seem to know a lot of shit, but he saw what he was doing; fucking up the french fries they had on supply, and he tells him that anything else like that, and they’d get infected with spuds. This earns a few confused stares from the other Red Team members, with Kara asking Ruben what that’s supposed to mean. Ruben wouldn’t answer that question straight away, but would assume himself as the one in charge of the Red Team for next time they do another service. In her confessional, Isabela says that Ruben may have a lot of optimism and prowess in what he can do, but at the same time, she knows he’s a stubborn hothead who seems a bit paper-skinned. The Red Team would talk about what they can do to improve for the next service, but Isabela would make a strict point that first things need to come first; communicate. Kara agrees to this, as she states in her confessional that being a leader comes with a lot of perks and power; she hopes to become someone strong and competent like Leslie from *Parks and Recreation*, even giving Amy Poehler a shoutout. Kara also talks to Henri, seeing how he’s a fellow Canadian contestant on the show. Henri says yes, he was born and raised in Quebec, but he’s become a dual citizen for both Canada and the United States, but he mostly rotates between Montreal and Plattsburgh to mentor new chefs whenever he’s not working on cruise ships. The two continue talking amongst themselves what it feels like to become Chef Ramsay’s next protege, the prospect too hot to give up. \n\nMeanwhile, the Blue Team were relieved to have finished another dinner service, with JC optimistically stating in his confessional that there’s about fifteen chefs left, and chances are, he’s got a one in fifteen chance of making it; all he needs to do is work by example, show dedication, and viola; it’s like he never left home at all. Though David would state in his confessional that he’s happy they won service tonight, he does note a couple of liabilities; especially mentioning JC, because he was dragging on a few Appetizers, but mostly the Entrees. David would borrow JC for a moment, and when they’d talk out on the patio, David would tell JC that he’s happy they finished service, but he also expresses concern for him; noting his Meat station mistakes. JC nodded and apologized, stating that he didn’t think cooking meatballs or burgers was difficult, and he had his own burgers in contention for winning the Punishment Pass Challenge. David does advise him that it’s fine, but he just wants him to focus on the next service, because chances are, his stock could be low as of now, and he’s had to make risky gambles to get back on. JC would ask David if he’s lost some money playing poker… David would think about it for a second, before letting out a heavy sigh, stating that there were moments in his life when he dealt with poker that he lost big money… And as he’d tell JC his story, David would mention in his confessional that nearly two years ago, he had lost a lot of his savings due to him making a major risk that proved fatal. Though he managed to scrape some money back, it’s still not enough in his eyes, as it really shook him hard with how much he had to surrender. That’s why he wants to work hard like the way he’s doing, and get better with how he manages not just his finances, but also himself. \n\nMeanwhile, the two teams were mingling with each other, with Samuel and Rio getting praises from people like Kara, Edward, Dani, and Shayna of how great they were performing out there. Samuel couldn’t stop blushing, and he’d state in his confessional that he’s here to become Ramsay’s next protege, not to be a celebrity; though he does contradict himself that winning Hell’s Kitchen does count for being a celebrity. Rio, however, does express optimism on being able to prove himself, stating that he knows he might not have a chance, but at the same time, he doesn’t want to give up. Kara sat next to him, and they’d bond with each other on getting to find that chance, with them telling each other fun life stories, or their biggest achievements in their respective lives. Kara was astonished to hear Rio’s been featured in a magazine with Dean Fearing, the ‘father of southwestern cuisine’, but she, as well as the others, don’t understand why he hasn’t been mentioned past that. Though Rio does state that he’s been having a lot of trouble finding a higher paying job, and that’s another reason why he’s had to take two jobs at once. Edward makes a confessional of how he can’t imagine how it feels to be in Rio’s shoes, but at the same time, there is the pressure of maintaining something, and he scratches the back of his head before he could finish his sentence. Shayna would also come over to Rio and tell him she knows it can be a bit tough finding a better job than the two he has, but she assures him that as long as he gets on the right footing, he’ll be bound for success. Rio smiles at this, and tells his fellow comrades that he’ll look into starting tomorrow. Over in the dorm kitchen, Henri was talking with Tem, Isabela, Allison, and Freddie when they noticed Rio’s confident boast; he’d state the ‘kid’ must have reached a breakthrough, but Allison does make a joke that it’s either that, or he’s still excited that he was Barney the Dinosaur for a night. Isabela does smile at this, and she expresses confidence in her confessional that she knows things will go right tomorrow, and she’ll stop at nothing to ensure that happens. Eventually, everyone would go to bed for the night…\n\n\\-----\n\n**Challenge**\n\nThe next morning, both teams would scamper out of bed to get dressed, as there is yet another challenge waiting for them. However, JC would immediately make note of a certain smell that’s coming to mind, and he would mention in his confessional that he knows it all too well… As soon as they make it down to the kitchen, they would find Ramsay standing behind a white-clothed table, with a few domes over plates. He would greet everyone upon their arrival, telling them that he’s got quite a treat for them to give them, and by that, he means something delicious for everyone to witness… Ramsay presented these special dishes, uncovering every dome; ropa vieja, rabo encendido, and picadillo. The British chef invited them all to try them, suggesting it’d be a ‘delicious breakfast’. Everyone took their turns tasting them, and upon them all finishing, Ramsay asked them what each dish has in common, to which JC immediately raises his hand. However, rather than giving him the go-ahead to answer, Ramsay explains he wants to give everyone an idea of what they’ll be in for today’s challenge, because it has a lot to do with Miami’s heritage… He would first have Marino dim the lights in the dining room a bit, with the maitre d’hotel doing so, creating a suspenseful atmosphere, with Shayna wondering if someone’s going to appear out of nowhere; if it does, she’ll faint. Ramsay would have everyone direct their attention to a panel, which had its lights turned off. He would take out his phone and activate something; first, Alberto Rivera’s *Eternity*, trying to create a musical, suspenseful feel. Later, he’d press something that activated the panel, making it illuminate colorful water that was raining down from the top of the panel to the bottom; at first, a cerulean blue light, and, thanks to added effects, Ramsay would add tropical ambience noises, complete with ocean wave sounds, soft wind, bird tweets, among others… Everyone was in awe as they watched the water lights hypnotizing them; nobody dared to speak up, as they didn’t want to ruin the moment. The water lights in the center would slowly change color to a royal blue, creating a shape of a certain country… Tem turned her head to find JC next to her already bursting into tears… JC tearfully addressed this in his confessional, stating that because Cuba is where his family originated from, he’s happy that they’re doing a challenge completely based on his roots. Ramsay kept the miniature light show on for a bit longer, before he turned to Marino, signalling to turn the lights back on. \n\nWith Ramsay turning the music off, but leaving the water light panel on, he tells them that Cuba has a variety of delicious culinary masterpieces; each of them come from a different area… He gestures to the panel, and tells them that for today’s challenge, the chefs will break up into two pairs and work on making a dish that represents any of the following regions of Cuba… On the panel, a portion of the royal blue water turns to a sky blue; one much lighter than cerulean. Ramsay says the lighter shade of blue represents the seaside; La Costa. And when he thinks of La Costa, he thinks of seafood dishes with a delicious hint of citrus; something that gives the dish a brighter color. In her confessional, Allison states she’s aware of a lot of these different culinary atmospheres; making a Cuban dish could be a way to strengthen her international palette. Back on the panel, another portion of royal blue turns to a brickish red, with Ramsay telling them this next region represents Las Montañas, the mountains; which is a mainly earthy, rustic environment; smoked meats with roasted vegetables as a side dish. A third portion of royal blue turns to light green, and Ramsay tells the chefs that portion is supposed to be El Campo, which represents a homestyled level of cooking; slightly less rustic, but does have a nature that people call home. JC would state in his confessional that he’d be a master of working on El Campo if he were chosen to do it. Finally, there are small portions of gray, which Ramsay calls La Habana Urbana, which he describes as being bold, palettes elevated to be artistic, colorful, creative… And how each chef will be chosen to do which subject will depend on the color of raffle rods the sous chefs will hand out. Ramsay would state there are four rods for each subject (La Costa, El Campo, and Las Montañas; sky blue, green, and red, respectively), except for La Habana Urbana’s gray, where there are three; meaning one person from the Red Team will work solo, while the rest will work together. As everyone draws from the buckets each sous chef handed out, they’d find out what they’re gonna cook with. Ruben makes a confessional of how he’s got La Costa, and is gonna have to find something creative that’ll make Ramsay shit himself with excitement. The others continue to draw rods until there are none left, and when everyone finds out who they’re gonna work with, they are told by Ramsay to pair up with them immediately, depending on what color they had. He reminds them one last time that any region of Cuba they’ll work on depends on the color of rod they have onhand, and he tells them to get started… now!\n\n\\-----\n\n**La Costa - Shayna &amp; Ruben vs. Tem &amp; David**\n\n**Las Montañas - Henri &amp; Allison vs. Edward &amp; Dani**\n\n**El Campo - Isabela &amp; Kara vs. Freddie &amp; JC**\n\n**La Habana Urbana - Rio vs. Sierra &amp; Samuel**\n\n\\-----\n\nWith the luz verde activated, all the chefs ran straight to their respective kitchens, determination in their veins as they worked to make a culinary festivity for Ramsay to taste. JC would be amped up in his confessional, as he knows so much about the countryside. He and Freddie debated on what kind of dish they’d make, and what would go well El Campo-style. Being the expert of Cuban culinary arts, JC takes the helm of what they could do, suggesting to Freddie making a sausage dish that isn’t too spicy, to which Freddie makes a lighthearted joke about how he doesn’t want Ramsay’s mouth to burn another time. Freddie activated the stove to start the sausage dish they’ll be working with, as they begin thinking of what kinds of spices they could use for their sauce. Meanwhile, Samuel worked with Sierra on their La Habana Urbana-style dish, both wondering what goes well in a metro Cuban environment. In his confessional, Samuel says he’s no expert on Cuba, but he’s sure that whatever dish they make will be one to wow Ramsay. Both of them debate on making a steak kind of dish. Shaking on that idea, Samuel starts prepping the steak, while Sierra debates what kinds of sauces they could use, only to contradict herself, deciding that perhaps they could make a festive kind of environment with contrasting sauces on the same plate together. The only thing is they need to see what kinds of sauces they need to put on, as there could be plenty of options, but Sierra suggests to Samuel they don’t want to overdo it. With Edward and Dani, they seem to be in sync with what to make for their Las Montañas dish, debating what Cubans like to make up in the mountaintop regions. Edward says in his confessional that the mountains of Cuba are more inland than out, and that means there are more chances of them making meat… He suggests to Dani they make something using pork, because he’s more than aware that island nations have lots of pigs. Dani quips back that she hopes he isn’t talking about the ‘Bay of Pigs’, otherwise, they’d have to ‘invade it’. Edward awkwardly nodded at that, making Dani ask if that was too soon. Nevertheless, Dani began making their pork dish, while Edward had to wonder what kind of marinade would go well in it, with his partner suggesting they try to make it a bit sweet, in addition to the rustic tang they have to go for. They’d debate kinds of starchy vegetables to add to the sauce, just to give it an earthy taste, before eventually deciding on yucca. Tem and David were seen working on the La Costa dish, before they ultimately went for lobster. In his confessional, David expresses his confidence that he and Tem will get their dish up to par with the tropics of Cuba. Both he and Tem debated on the kind of twist they’ll work to make, before coming up with a garlic and lime butter, as well as adding a little salsa that can go well with it. They think of different fruits to pair it with, before going with mango, because fruits like them can balance the overall dish with their sweetness, and Tem says in her confessional that she’s never been a huge mango eater, but she’s confident that it’s definitely good to be used for anything, especially on savory foods. \n\nOver with the Red Team, they were working hard to give Ramsay the keys to a culinary masterpiece that would make all of Cuba proud. Over with Allison and Henri, they were working on a dish that screamed mountaintops. In her confessional, Allison says working with Henri is a bit on the nose, stating she knows a lot of ideas on what to cook, but if she can really teach an old dog new tricks, it’s gonna be something he’ll have to learn with her. She would be seen guiding Henri on how to cook their beefy dish, to which Henri responds he’s got no issue with it, thanking her. In his own confessional, Henri says Allison is a lovely young lady, but he’s tackled these high seas even when she was in diapers. Allison, meanwhile, was caramelizing onions for their mixture to decorate, insistent that their dish would suffice with them. Henri understood, stating it should have a good balance of sweet and rustic, and when Allison asks if cafe (or coffee) works well for their dish, Henri says perhaps a hint of it would go, because he doesn’t want any overwhelming flavors from Ramsay. Over with Ruben and Shayna, they were busy cooking the La Costa dish, and they collectively came up with a special octopus dish. The question was what kinds of spices or seasoning would they use for it. They ultimately decide to try a barbecue sauce with a hint of mango, with Shayna mentioning in her confessional that a few days ago, they had a challenge-winning dish that made the menu with mango, and states that perhaps they should replicate it a little. Additionally, Shayna suggests to Ruben they make a coconut rum that can mesh the flavors out, that way the barbecue won’t be too overpowering. Meanwhile, Kara and Isabela were working hard on their El Campo dish, as they debated what kinds of ingredients they’d use. They want to try making a chicken dish, but Kara wondered what could be more countryside-oriented, and Isabela says they could try a corncake base for the chicken. In her confessional, she states how her grandparents had made a similar recipe to the one she and Kara are making, and she wants to try and replicate it; but less corncake. The two ladies seemed confident that they’d get this recipe out in the running for wowing Chef Ramsay, making sure to put a special Cuban jerk marinade for the chicken. Over with Rio, he was working solo on the La Habana Cubana dish, and this meant that he was working double overtime to make sure that it would be a unique one. He states in his confessional that he had only learned about Cuban dishes for only less than a year, but he wants to make a niche twist to a classic kind. When Michelle asked him what he was cooking, Rio stated he was making a pork dish, but he wanted to give it a delicious spin that the streets of Cuba will love him for. \n\nEach chef continued to cook their dish with their partner, time dwindling as they kept working nonstop to try and complete it before Ramsay ordered them to plate. With Tem and David, they’re working well in tandem. However, David didn’t notice his lobster cooking a little longer than usual, though he states in his confessional, it’s all about taking risks and making sure they pay off well in the end. Meanwhile, Ruben got a taste of the sauce Shayna was about to baste, and when he gave her the thumbs up, she would glaze it on top. Elsewhere, Isabela and Kara were putting the finishing touches for their chicken dish. For giggles, they borrowed Rio to take a taste of their marinade to see if they needed to take anything out. After a little taste, Rio described it as just right; stating there’s not too much habanero they used in it, but just a niche blend between hot and spicy. Isabela tasted the marinade herself, and she thought it was a bit spicier, so she suggested to Kara they try to reduce the spice with lime juice. In her confessional, Isabela states that the acidity of lime juice can make the spiciness a bit more tolerable; she just had to try something like that. Over with JC and Freddie, they tasted the sauce of their spice, and Freddie started coughing a bit, asking JC how much spice they put in their dish, and in his confessional, JC is worried that he may have put too much spice for their sausage, stressing they cannot lose like this, given how limited time they have to make a new sauce. However, Freddie has a new idea on how to reduce the spice of the sauce a bit more; oranges. After squeezing an orange, he adds it into the sauce, states in his confessional that they seemed so close, he had to get something to simmer it down. Meanwhile, Samuel and Sierra were already plating their steak dish, and Sierra stated that this is as easy as the time she won her team the soccer championship when she was nine. \n\nRamsay began the countdown, signifying the final few seconds of the challenge. Everyone raced to the pass to present their dishes, but Dani nearly slipped as she carried hers and Edward’s dish, only for Edward to catch her, his hands on her arms. After Dani thanked Edward for the help, they put their dish on the pass, with Dani wiping the sweat off her brow in her confessional, muttering how that would’ve been a disaster had she slipped. With all the chefs lining their dishes up, Ramsay would congratulate all of them for putting a solid effort into crafting their foods; no matter what portion of Cuba they’re representing, he’s sure that they’ll make people proud, including himself. However, Ramsay says that he won’t be judging this alone; joining him will be a chef-entrepreneur who’s made a major name of herself in Miami; the chef and owner of three different restaurants; Eileen Andrade. The young woman enters the dining room to the applause of the other chefs, and JC says in his confessional that he’s been to *Finka Table &amp; Tap* a few times with his family; he also mentions he’s met Eileen before, but only for a hot ten seconds. Eileen would state it’s a pleasure, and she can’t wait to see how everyone’s takes on each culinary region of Cuba comes out. In her confessional, Kara expresses confidence in presenting their dish to Eileen, given how she’s a pretty strong force in the Miami culinary community. \n\nFirst up was La Costa, with Shayna/Ruben vs. Tem/David, and as the duo brought their dishes up, Ramsay and Eileen would first focus their attention on the Red Team’s dish, asking them what they’ve concocted. Ruben would describe their cooked octopus dish, complete with a little hint of mango barbecue drizzle and citrusy coconut rum on top. The judges would ask them what made them come up with the octopus inspiration, and Ruben, always quick to the punch, would state he knows octopus is a strong delicacy, especially in places like Latin America. Shayna would also back him up, stating that she’s cooked with Caribbean flavors in the past, and says that octopus is one of the more popular foods on her occasional menu item that gets ordered. Upon taking a bite, Ramsay and Eileen would note how properly cooked it was. However, Eileen says that when they had mentioned Caribbean flavors in it, she feels that the barbecue overwhelms the other tropical flavors in the octopus, and as such, she’s not sure if it’s *truly* La Costa-feeling. Ramsay agrees, pointedly asking the two if they’d gotten this octopus in the mountains of Cuba, as he can’t seem to taste any hint of fruit in it. Shayna would shake her head in her confessional, wondering how she didn’t taste the sauce before they dressed it. Turning their attention to Tem and David on the Blue Team, Ramsay asked them what they made. The two would describe their dish; grilled lobster with a garlic-lime butter, as well as mango-salsa complete with jalapenos and picked onions. Both judges seemed intrigued with the presentation of the meal, with Eileen stating that it sounds tropical enough, and while Ramsay agrees, he wants to know if it tastes as good as it sounds… However, upon making the cross-section, Ramsay wonders what the hell he’s cutting into… because it’s a bit tough and rubbery… Tasting it, Eileen compares the lobster’s texture to tasting a rubber tire, and that’s more than enough reason for Ramsay to declare it overcooked, and it’s especially a tragedy because the salsa was a lot more appetizing to stomach. David would rub his head in his confessional, cursing that he should’ve taken it off the grill sooner. Ramsay and Eileen were left with the decision of which duo deserved a point, between overcooked lobster and octopus with conflicting flavors. Eileen would apologize, and say that neither team deserves a point, even with the amount of effort they’ve made, she can’t say either La Costa dish is appealing. Ramsay would sigh in agreement, telling both duos to piss off. In his confessional, Ruben was a bit tense with the final decision, even uttering a “*La Costa my dick,*”\n\nHoping to clear their palettes, Ramsay called for the duos in charge of Las Montañas to come forward. First up was Edward and Dani, and Ramsay asked what kind of dish they had made. They presented their pork dish with a mojo complete with minced garlic, onion, and a little orange juice, with a hint of yucca. Along with it was a side of seasoned black beans cooked with rice. Judging by the smell, Eileen stated that it does hold a reminder of rural Cuba, with Ramsay agreeing. Wondering if it tastes as good as it does, they cut into the pork, and after a couple of bites, Eileen explains that the dish has this smoky taste with a little tang from the orange juice they had used, and it does bring a scape that could be found in the mountains. Ramsay agreed that the pork was cooked deliciously, and with a limited amount of time, they somehow managed to recreate a slow-roasted environment for the protein, putting the smoky texture intact. Hearing this, Dani and Edward high five each other, with Dani stating in her confessional that this had  better put them on the scoreboard. Next up were Allison and Henri, who presented their oxtail dish with garlic mojo, minced caramelized onions, and a side of seasoned rice and beans. Henri also adds that they put in a small blend of cafe into the marinade, stating that he and Allison wanted to give a sort of earthy texture. Eileen states that cafe is an important element when using it to make dishes inspired by the mountains, because it’s essentially homegrown; the kind of rural hospitality that gives each dish a splendid identity. Ramsay agrees to it, stating that judging by the smell of the dish, it seems like with the touch of coffee, it added more to this beef dish, but does wonder if it tastes as good as it smells. Upon taking bites into the dish, they found that it was delicious; Ramsay stated the oxtail was cooked beautifully, and with that addition of coffee, it enhanced the dish a bit, and each texture and flavor definitely brought out a mountainous vibe. Turning to Eileen, he asked which dish was the best one. However, Eileen says it’s a tough one; between the oxtail and the pork, they’re both strong contenders. Ramsay would agree with her, stating that it should be a great surprise that both teams have been awarded a point, making the score 1-1. In her confessional, Allison slightly disagrees with the judges, feeling that her and Henri’s dish was more Las Montañas than Dani and Edward’s, but it’s fine; they at least got a point. \n\nNext up was the El Campo part, and it was the battle between Isabela/Kara and JC/Freddie. Ramsay would ask Isabela and Kara what they made, and they’d tell him they went for a safe environment with a delicious pastel de choclo y pollo, a chicken dish with a corn cake base, complete with picked onions and peppers. Additionally, they’ve made it jerk chicken, where the marinade was a bit spicy, but less overpowering. The judges seemed intrigued by the presentation of the dish, noting how it’s a little tough to create such a dish like that, but the question is if it tastes good as it looks. Upon tasting a bite, they note how spicy it is, but Eileen asked what other ingredients they used for the sauce, to which Isabela states she used lime juice. Eileen compliments on how the acidity reduces the overall spicy tang in the sauce, and it makes the overall dish more worthy to eat. Ramsay agrees to it, also noting how delicious the corncake base was a surprise, but he can say it truly felt like he was eating in the countryside of Cuba. Freddie and JC were called up next to present their dish, and they would show their cuban sausage with a semi-spicy reduction sauce, and with a bit of orange mixed into their sauce. Eileen expresses her curiosity of orange used in the sauce, asking if they had their dish from the countryside, or even the shores. However, Ramsay does note how the presentation looks decent, but wonders if the dish is truly El Campo. The two judges took a bite from the sausage, and though JC was seen anxiously grimacing, Eileen stated that the dish was spicy, but the use of orange seemed to have taken off plenty of heat. Ramsay agreed, stating at first, he thought the semi-spicy reduction was spicy, but then he could feel the balance of sweetness and spice mixing together. Overall, the dish is very hearty; Eileen also added that she was afraid the dish would come off as more of a La Costa mixed with El Campo, but after tasting some of the spices in the mixture, it seemed a lot more El Campo, just more near the seashores, but at the same time, having an inland feel. Ultimately, they turn to each other, with Ramsay asking which dish she preferred. However, Eileen awkwardly chuckled in response, apologizing to Ramsay, but explaining both dishes reminded her of El Campo… She decides that both of them are worthy of a point, keeping both teams tied 2-2. In his confessional, JC is relieved to hear that his and Freddie’s dish managed to impress Eileen, while Kara makes her own one, stating that she needs to take plenty of lessons on how to be careful with making stuff spicy, but is thankful Isabela stepped in. \n\nThe final portion was La Habana Urbana, calling for one duo from the Blue Team, as well as the soloist from the Red Team to come forward with their dishes. First turning to Sierra and Samuel, they would describe their dish; a stuffed plantain with ropa vieja steak, as well as a ‘graffiti drizzle’. When asked to describe their ‘graffiti dish’, Sierra would explain they’ve made it a bit contrasting in terms of colors; green being a cilantro-lime crema, sunset being a slightly spicy mango sauce with a hint of guava, red being a guajillo crema, and so on, so forth. Upon cutting into the dish, they’d find out that the steak was leathery tough to cut through, noting that it’s overcooked, much to Samuel and Sierra’s dismay, with the former stating in his confessional that he should’ve kept a better eye on it. Upon tasting it, however, Eileen would state that in spite of that, the dish itself is delicious. Ramsay would concur, but would say that had it not been the steak being overcooked, then it would’ve been a lot better, but they’ll have to see if it’ll fare best against the Red Team’s next dish. They’d turn their attention to Rio, who would present his deconstruction of a Cuban Sandwich; roasted pork with a rum-mustard caramel wrapped in ibérico ham, with garnishes of crisped brioche decked with garlic-butter, and melted quenelle streaks. Eileen would ask Rio what he was going for with this dish, and Rio would respond that he wanted to try a street vendor option, noting the nightlife of Havana, and though he’s never been to Cuba, he could imagine what places like there and Miami could offer as street food. Ramsay would notate how it almost looks like a tableside option to use for a potential service, stating how it looks pretty appetizing, but the question would be if it tastes as good as it looks. The two judges would cut into the meat, noting how beautifully cooked the pork looks, before each of them takes a bite. Eileen was the first to express her intrigue with the dish, stating that she could taste a little pickle acid in it, with Ramsay asking Rio if he used any pickle dusting for the dish, to which Rio confirmed, as well as a hint of plantain dusting. Eileen states to Rio that it’s important that pickle and mustard be used in Cuban sandwiches, as they push the acidity more than it already would’ve been. Ramsay says that the dish is pretty good… But is it worthy of receiving a point to break the tie…\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd after careful deliberation between the two judges, they agree, earning Rio the third point. \n\n**3**\\-2 (Red Team wins)\n\nRio was the first to celebrate, along with his teammates in back of him, as he would state in his confessional that even though he was never born in Cuba, he’s more than happy to show off his culinary attributes for the country. Eileen would clarify that the dish he concocted truly is a La Habana Urbana, stating it definitely sounds like a staple street food dish for samples, or to Ramsay’s case, tableside. As Rio reunited with his teammates, he was met with hugs from Kara and Isabela, with the latter stating in her confessional how happy she is that Rio won the challenge for them. Meanwhile, the Blue Team were living up to their namesake, being blue from learning they lost the challenge, with Sierra stating in her confessional that they win some, and they lose some, but she does know that there are some people who’re gonna have a day. \n\n\\-----\n\n**To be continued...**', 'TurboThundr', 'HellsKitchenFanFics', 'https://reddit.com/r/HellsKitchenFanFics/comments/1ooro8f/hells_kitchen_miami_episode_7_part_1/', 5, 0, '2025-11-05 09:59:00', '2025-11-07 23:40:41');

(45, 'reddit', '1oq0uoa', '[Sunnyside Square] - Part 2: Tuesday', '[Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1oklya4/sunnyside_square_part_1_monday/)\n\n**1999**\n\nSandra knew she must have finished the day on set. Maggie and their friends must have descended behind the wall. Joey and the rest of the puppeteers must have congratulated her on her first day as an actor. Dorian—Dory, she had to remember he wanted to be called that—must have grabbed her in a smothering hug after he called it a wrap. She must have returned it.\n\nShe didn’t remember any of it. When she began to sing with Maggie, holding herself together with small-town hunger and grit, she had gone somewhere else. Something else—someone else had taken over her. Someone better.\n\nWhen she came back to her body, Sandra was in the middle of another performance. This time, the venue was Saint Beatrice’s United Methodist Church. The network had decided she had to go to Mama’s funeral after all. The public relations department had insisted. The network couldn’t chance a scandal so early on in their newest talent’s career. They had even sent Caroline along to keep their eyes on Sandra and make sure she made it back to set within 24 hours.\n\nSandra reminded herself that she only had to get through the song. At the reading of the will, Attorney Pruce had told her and her father that one of her mother’s final wishes was for Sandra to sing her favorite song at her funeral. At least Sandra wouldn’t have to learn a new piece. Mama had sung this one to hear every night before bed.\n\nSitting in the hard wooden pew where she had spent every Sunday morning as a girl, Sandra thought of all the lessons she had learned in the small sanctuary under the eyes of Brother Joel and the beautiful dead man on the stained-glass cross.\n\nMake sure the hem of your skirt never rises above your knee.\n\nNever ruin a conversation with talk of unpleasant things.\n\nSmile kindly when a deacon’s eyes linger on you a little too long.\n\nSmile kindly when Brother Joel starts to scream about you and everyone you love burning in hell for eternity.\n\nAlways smile kindly.\n\nAnd, most importantly, do all the good you can for all the people you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can. No matter what.\n\nShe tried to keep her mind on that last commandment as she watched her black heels walk up the thick blue carpet of the stairs. Singing this song was what Mama wanted. It was doing good. She was commanded to do it.\n\nThe smell of charring salt on fresh fried chicken from the kitchen behind the stage brought her back to Mama’s kitchen in their little white house. She looked down into the casket and saw her mother in an old-fashioned rose pink cotton dress. The funeral director had painted the makeup on her corpse with a precision that she would have appreciated. Looking down at her mother, Sandra hoped she was finally happy. Not just smiling, but happy.\n\nIn the moments before Dr.  Jo, her old piano teacher started the song, Sandra felt the eyes burning her skin again. There were only a few dozen people in St. Bee’s on this Tuesday morning, but Sandra’s heart pounded like she was in the center of the Coliseum. Her father and Caroline, the two people she most needed to please, were in the front pew staring up at her with expectation. Everyone in the church was waiting for her to do good. Her head reeled at the thunder of Dr. Jo’s cough and the earthquake of Brother Joel opening a peppermint. By instinct, she looked towards her mother.\n\nShe was gone. Maggie was lying in the casket instead. Dr. Jo played the first lilting notes of “The Rainbow Connection,” and Sandra went away again.\n\n**2024**\n\nThe next day was more of what had become Mikey’s normal. He woke up at 7:55 to Bree’s compulsory good morning and text-message briefing. He left for the firm at 8:50. He tried to enjoy being a lawyer while he still could. Then he left for the campaign at exactly 5:00.\n\nHe turned right off of Main and left onto Reading. Coming to a stop sign, Mikey wished he could take the ramp to the interstate and leave town. He could hang another shingle in another small town—maybe Redford or Gaynor. That’s all he had ever wanted to do: practice law and help people. He knew that winning this campaign would mean going into politics as a career and leaving the law behind for good.\n\nDriving down Reading towards Highway 130, Mikey remembered that he had at least been able to take a new client that day. Dr. Wei Tate, the family doctor who had seen Bree and Mikey their whole lives and seen their parents even before then, was finally retiring. Mikey was happy for Dr. Tate. The old man certainly deserved to rest.\n\nMikey only wished he was doing something to help Dr. Tate instead of representing Quality Care, the regional hospital chain that was buying out the old doctor’s clinic in an offer he couldn’t refuse. Mikey had read about how hospital monopolization hurt small towns like Dove Hill, but their grand opening would bring dozens of new jobs and a guaranteed ribbon-cutting. Mikey told himself it was the greater good. Even if it wasn’t, Quality Care’s offer to start a financial relationship with a rising star politician was one that Bree couldn’t let him refuse.\n\nLost in dreading work on the Quality Care acquisition, Mikey realized he had arrived at the publicist’s office. Set as close to the town line as it could be, the building looked ashamed to be in a place like Dove Hill. It wouldn’t have been within the municipal limits but for a favor the construction company’s owner owed Mayor LeBlanc. Mikey wasn’t sorry for the distance. The building’s ostentatiously corporate aesthetic would definitely have disrupted the streets where he grew up.\n\n“Walking in,” Mikey texted Bree. Bree responded with a question mark.\n\nPassing the two-story’s unnecessary stainless-steel elevators, Mikey walked to the end of the entrance hall and took the stairs. He found the publicist’s office at the end of the hall that smelled like fresh ink and cold paper. The glass of the door was frosted and printed with “SCARNES AND BLUMPH” in large red letters.\n\nMikey entered a small overwhelmingly white lobby with a kind looking older lady sitting behind the desk. Her name plate read “Mary Ann.” Mikey approached her. “Hi there,” he smiled. She smiled back a bit surprised, like she had not been spoken to in some time. “Excuse me. I’m here for a meeting with Mr. Scarnes.”\n\n“Of course,” she answered. It seemed like she was happy to have something to do. “Right this—”\n\nBefore Mary Ann could stand all the way up, Ryan Scarnes entered with the energy of a used car dealer. Without so much as acknowledging Mary Ann, Ryan reached out to shake Mikey’s hand. It was a demand. “Well hello, Mr. Dobson. Welcome to our humble abode.” Mikey glanced at Mary Ann who was already back in her chair as though she had never moved.\n\n“Hi,” Mikey said while feeling his hand reach to meet Ryan’s. Mikey knew it was the right thing to do, but he thought his hand might leave the shake coated in grime. Despite Ryan’s clearly tailored suit, razor-straight teeth, and stone-set hair, Mikey couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something filthy about him. “I’m Mikey Dobson. Nice to meet you. Thank you for meeting with me today.”\n\nRyan looked down at Mary Ann. “Mary Jane, would you please get Mr. Dobson a sparkling water in a champagne flute?” Mikey didn’t bother to mention that he didn’t drink sparkling water. Turning back to Mikey, Ryan forced a laugh. “It’s a little early for champagne, but we can pretend.”\n\nRyan walked back down the hallway where he had emerged while continuing his monologue. Mikey assumed he was supposed to follow. When they reached the large conference room stuffed with as many mirrors and gilded paperweights as Ryan Scarnes’s idea of taste would allow, Bree was poring over a table covered in pictures of Mikey.\n\n“Hey sis,” Mikey ventured.\n\n“Hi,” Bree said, partially looking up from the oversized conference table. In the second she turned her eyes to him, Mikey saw that same flash of warmth.\n\n“Good to see you…again,” Mikey joked while opening his arms for a hug.\n\nBree responded with a polite laugh and a reach for a more professional welcome. “You too. How long has it been? 21 hours?” Of course she knew the precise time.\n\nSinking into one of the gold-trimmed leather chairs, Mikey thought that Bree and Ryan looked like the actual politicians. Bree in her dark gray pantsuit and Ryan in his bespoke charcoal coat and glaring red tie. He laughed at himself as he looked down at his department store slacks and wholesale button-down.\n\n“Now where were we, Ms. Dobson?” Ryan asked with a humility that almost broke under the weight of pretense.\n\nBree seemed not to notice. She seemed not to notice a lot about Ryan Scarnes. In her mind, the campaign was all too fortunate to have signed with a publicist as young, tenacious, and data-loaded as him. She promised Mikey that Ryan’s discounted prices were worth the implicit promises of access she had made on Mikey’s behalf.\n\n“We were just reviewing the options for the final mailer,” Bree reported.\n\n“Right. Our focus group suggested that they liked seeing Mikey outdoors. They said it made him look approachable, friendly. You’ll see the outdoor shots in the top-left quadrant.”\n\nAs Ryan and Bree walked to the other side of the table, Mary Ann gently entered the room. She was like a friendly mouse: eager to help but afraid to be seen.\n\n“Here you go, sweetie,” she cooed to Mikey.\n\n“Thanks, Ms. Mary Ann. I appreciate it. I’m Mikey by the way. How’s your day—”\n\n“That’ll be all,” Ryan interrupted. He looked at Mary Ann like she had been caught.\n\n“Yes, Mr. Scarnes.” Mary Ann and Mikey exchanged a smile as she snuck back out the door.\n\nBree and Ryan continued to talk about Mikey. Or at least about the face in the gallery. Ryan had done his job once again and made Mikey unrecognizable to himself. They examined every picture on the table as if it were a unique masterpiece with hidden details in every inch. Mikey just saw the man he didn’t know. In one, the man was sitting on a bench. In another, he was standing in front of a tree. In another, he was leaning on a brick wall. The only thing Mikey especially liked about the pictures was that they were all taken around the Mason County Courthouse.\n\n“I’m torn between the ones standing in front of the doors and the ones sitting on the steps,” either Bree or Ryan said. They had both long since forgotten Mikey was in the room.\n\nMikey felt their conversation grew louder and louder as it went on. It grew from a business transaction into a cable news debate. Looking at all of the photos of the man who was not him, he felt his breath catch in his chest. “Who is this?” he thought. His head began to spin into lightness. “It’s not me.” He wanted to scream. That would have been inappropriate.\n\nInching his eyes up and down the rows of pictures of the other him, Mikey caught something strange in the corner of his eye. In one of the pictures on the courthouse steps, Mikey saw something in a bright shade of blue. Not the cautious blue of a politician’s tie. The rich, glowing blue of a gemstone.\n\nMikey stood from his seat and leaned over to the picture with the blue presence. He saw it. Sitting over his shoulder on the white concrete steps was a smiling blue turtle. The turtle sat like a small child with its legs out in front and its eyes looking straight at Mikey. Mikey couldn’t tell if the turtle’s eyes were looking at the him in the conference room or the him on the courthouse steps. But they were looking. Watching. The turtle’s smile was stretched so far that it looked like its felt was going to rip at the seams.\n\nMikey didn’t know how he knew the turtle was made of felt. He just did. He also knew it’s—his name was Tommy and that he liked trains. Mikey had met Tommy before. But it hadn’t been at the courthouse. No one had been there except for Mikey, Bree, and Ryan. Mikey remembered that because, despite his silent objections, Bree and Ryan had convinced the city judge to end court early that afternoon.\n\nLooking into Tommy’s eyes, Mikey felt two conflicting emotions. His panic continued to build. He knew that turtle had not been at the courthouse that day. Why were his eyes telling him otherwise? But he also felt a sense of peace. Even though Tommy’s eyes were watching both Mikeys like they were afraid he would stop smiling, Mikey somehow felt like Tommy was an old friend. Like they had played together as kids.\n\nBefore Mikey could decide what he was supposed to feel, Ryan turned his schmooze away from his conversation with Bree. “You have good tastes, Mr. Dobson. Ms. Dobson and I were just deciding to use one of the courthouse steps pictures on the mailer.”\n\n“Yeah, sounds good,” Mikey said without turning away from Tommy.\n\nRyan turned back to Bree. “Now just to decide which one.”\n\nWhile Bree and Ryan carefully discussed which of the nine seemingly identical photos to use, Mikey carefully picked up the one with Tommy. When he looked at it more closely, Tommy was gone. If Bree or Ryan noticed one of their pictures missing, they didn’t show it as they continued their deliberations.\n\nFolding the picture and placing it into his shirt pocket, Mikey noticed a new sensation. Pressing against his skin, the picture felt warm. It was a comforting heat—a log fire at Christmas. But it was also narrow and pointed—an eye staring through his heart.\n\n**\\***	**\\***	**\\***\n\nBy the time Bree ended the meeting at Scarnes and Blumph, Mikey had convinced himself to forget the burning in his shirt pocket. His skin felt it, but he decided he didn’t. Following Bree’s car back into town, he could only think about Tommy. How did he know the too-friendly turtle? And how had he *seen* him?\n\nMikey was reassuring himself of his senses when he and Bree pulled up to Delano Plaza, one of the several strip malls that had risen from Dove Hill’s ground during the early 2000s. They got out of their cars and met each other in front of China Delight. Their town’s sit-down dining options had dwindled to not much more than a handful of nearly identical Chinese buffets.\n\nMikey appreciated Bree making the time on his schedule for this. Every Tuesday since they had moved back home after school up north, the Dobson siblings had kept the standing commitment. During these weekly dinners, they tried to avoid talking about work. Or politics. Or anything “real,” as Bree had put it. When the campaign started, Mikey made her promise to keep their sibling dinners sacred. He wondered if she could with only weeks to the election.\n\nBree followed Sue Lee, the restaurant’s newest waitress, through the winding path to the back of the building. Sitting the Dobsons at a table next to a wall strewn with red and yellow lanterns, Sue Lee asked about their parents. Bree confirmed that they were doing fine. As Sue Lee handed Mikey the menu that no one ever read, he asked her how she liked working at China Delight. She said it was a job. Still, Mikey was happy for her. He had known Sue Lee in her harder times in high school.\n\nAfter they made their plates of fried chicken, fried rice, and fried donuts, Mikey attempted small talk. That had never been the Dobson family’s gift.\n\n“So have you heard from mom and dad?”\n\n“Yeah,” Bree said with all the care of someone saying they had seen that afternoon’s episode of *Judge Judy*. “Mom texted—either last week or the week before. She asked how you were.”\n\nBetween sips from his oversized red cup, Mikey looked at her with expectation and mild dread.\n\n“Don’t worry. I told her you were fine. She said that dad said to make sure you were keeping up at the firm. Still not sure why I’m always the messenger.”\n\n“You know how they are. Honestly, though, I’m glad they text you and not me.” Mikey wished he meant that. It was one of those technical truths that their dad had taught him to use to avoid making anyone uncomfortable. Truthfully, Mikey would have loved to feel his phone vibrate with a text from his mom. But ever since spring of his senior year, and everything that had happened, his parents’ words to him had faded from well-meaning smothering to benign silence.\n\n“You’re welcome,” Bree smirked. Mikey knew she was only half joking. Even when they were kids, Bree had taken care of him. When their mother scolded him for using the wrong fork for salad, Bree would change the conversation to her recent science fair win. When their father had had too much wine and soap-boxed about the wrong kind of people coming to Dove Hill, Bree would distract everyone by playing “Clair de Lune” for the twenty-second time. As they blew the powdered sugar off their donuts, Mikey realized he had never told Bree how he felt.\n\n“Really though, thanks,” he said. Bree paused with dough in her mouth and looked at him like he had spoken Welsh.\n\n“For?”\n\nMikey hesitated as he worked to express something “real.” He laughed to himself when he saw the bit of dough sitting in Bree’s mouth. He hadn’t seen her that unpolished in years.\n\n“Oh, no,” Bree said, laughing and finally swallowing. “I’m not paying again this week. You’re the fancy attorney after all.”\n\n“No,” Mikey stammered. He mentally smacked himself for ruining the fun and tried to find the words he had lost. He needed to say this. “It’s just… You’ve always taken care of me. Especially with mom and dad. I appreciate it.”\n\nHe could tell he had struck a nerve. Bree Dobson didn’t like to receive gratitude. At least she didn’t think she did. It felt unwieldy.\n\n“Well, you can start paying me back by ordering me a beer.” Looking at his sister, Mikey knew that was the best he was going to get. Bree was her mother’s daughter after all.\n\nMikey turned his eyes towards the ceiling in an attempt to escape the awkwardness that had come to sit with them. He noticed the television sitting in the far corner.\n\nPointing towards it, he asked, “Do you remember watching TV on Saturday mornings? When mom and dad were on their weekends in the country?” Mikey had always loved those weekends. “I can’t believe our eyes didn’t fall out from staring at the screen that long.”\n\n“Those were good days. Not exactly how I remember them though.”\n\n“What do you mean? We would watch TV. And eat our weight in sugary cereal. And—” He stopped. He could tell Bree was forcing a smile now. It was the polite thing to do. “Hey…what’s wrong?”\n\n“Nothing,” she lied. “It’s just…I’m glad you were happy. But for me, those days were for cleaning the house for mom.”\n\nMikey went quiet with a guilt he couldn’t name. He had forgotten about it, but Bree was right. While he was watching cartoons, Bree was doing the chores for the whole family. “You…you could’ve asked me. I would’ve helped you.”\n\n“I know,” Bree said with a proud smile. “I know you would have. But I wanted you to be a kid. To be happy. I was happy to help.”\n\nSeeing the faintest hint of longing in his sister’s dimples, Mikey felt the burning on his chest again. Sue Lee brought Bree her two-bit beer. Even on a supposed night off, Bree was minding the money. The heat rising in his pocket, Mikey remembered the picture. And Tommy.\n\n“Do you remember me watching a show called *Sunnyside Square*?” The burning stopped, but Mikey didn’t notice. He was onto something.\n\n“No. But honestly, you watched so much TV that it would be a miracle if I remembered any of it. You would even wake up before I did to start. And that was an achievement even before I started Adderall.”\n\nMikey kept thinking out loud. “I think it was like a puppet show… Hand puppets maybe?”\n\n“Well, I may not remember what shows you *did* watch, but I know it wasn’t that. I never saw anything but cartoons. I tried to turn on a science show for you once, and you asked where the talking animals were.”\n\nMikey paused. Describing *Sunnyside Square* to his sister, he remembered more and more. It still wasn’t much, but he *knew* he had watched a show called *Sunnyside Square*. He remembered seeing the blue turtle sitting on a brick wall: the brick wall from his dream. His mind felt like there was someone else there. Someone he loved—but didn’t know.\n\n“Really? I remember puppets I think? And always feeling…happy…”\n\nIt was more than that. Mikey couldn’t see *Sunnyside Square*, but he could feel it. He had felt lost so often as a kid—and as an adult. He had felt left behind when his parents went to the cabin and Bree went to work. But, when he would watch that show, it felt like home. He always felt seen.\n\n“Must have been some show,” Bree teased, taking a sip from her bottle. “But yeah, I’m sure I don’t remember it. It was cartoons or…well, different cartoons.”\n\nNo. Sunnyside Square was something better than cartoons. Something real. *Someone* real. With that thought, Mikey remembered. Her name was Sunny Sandy. She was perfect.\n\n**\\***	**\\***	**\\***\n\nMikey wanted to drive straight home. Instead, he tried to finish the sibling dinner as normally as possible. He read his fortune from the freshly stale cookie, paid Sue Lee a 25% tip, gave Bree an awkward hug, and then rushed back to his apartment going as fast as he could without speeding.\n\nHe didn’t stop to undress when he got home. He pulled his laptop from his bag and sat at his desk. He couldn’t stand to lose any glimpse of Sandy’s face in his memory.\n\nThen he realized he had no idea what to search. All he knew was the name Sunny Sandy and the title *Sunnyside Square*.\n\nSearching “Sunny Sandy” led to a handful of beach-focused social media models and a few cloyingly cute children’s books about a yellow cat. He spent what felt like an hour looking through the results only to learn that both the models and the smiling cat in the books looked almost desperately “sunny.”\n\nSearching “Sunnyside Square” at least brought up places, but none were the park that hauntingly graced his dreams. He wondered why a name that was anything but subtle had been used for everything from parking garages to a neighborhood in Cambodia. Still, trying to find anything that would lead him to *his* Sunnyside Square, he spent an hour—or two—three?—working through every turn on the phrase he could think of.\n\nPausing for a breath, he looked at the clock in the corner of his screen. 1:52. He had to be back on the campaign trail in a little over six hours for the first of his morning meet-and-greets. He needed to rest. He was going to face a firing line of voters all wanting a piece of him in exchange for their ballot. He could already feel the exhaustion. He felt the dread in his bones. The guilt in his marrow.\n\nThen it came to him. The words that Sunny Sandy used to start every episode of the show. “Welcome to Sunnyside Square—where the sun can never stop shining!” He had always been struck by that phrase. Not “where the sun always shines” or even “where it’s always sunny.” Sandy said the sun could *never stop shining*. He didn’t know whether that inspired him—or petrified him.\n\nHe typed “where the sun can never stop shining” into the search engine. This time there were zero results. If Mikey ever allowed himself to feel anger, he would have felt it then. He had been so sure that that was the one. Standing from the thrifted office chair, he walked to his kitchenette. He wasn’t hungry after all the fried rice, but he wanted to consume.\n\nReaching towards his dusty counter for the hard candy he had taken on the way out of China Delight, Mikey found an invitation in the dark. After seeing what his father had become, he never drank alcohol, but a corporate client had recently given him a bottle of what Bree had told him was bottom-of-the-barrel red wine. He had wanted to throw it away, but it was a polite gesture. Looking at the glass reflecting the moonlight, Mikey decided he had earned a drink. He was working hard—for Dove Hill, for his parents, for Bree, even for Ryan Scarnes. He was happy to do it, he reminded himself. It was his job. This would make it easier.\n\nHe took the bottle back to his desk and took a long drink. He almost spit it out, but he was supposed to like it. Lifting his hand to close his laptop, he noticed it. He figured the search results had refreshed while he was picking his poison. There was one result now. “Keep On the Sunny Side.” A PDF file with the URL [https://www.dovehilldaily.com/news/1999/alwaysonthesunnyside](https://www.dovehilldaily.com/news/1999/alwaysonthesunnyside). He clicked it.\n\nA black-and-white scan of a newspaper clipping appeared, pinched and pulled in strange places. Whoever had scanned it was shaking. The distortion made him think of the screeching scrapes of a dial-up. He started to read. *SANDY MAKES GOOD.* He trembled and told himself it was from excitement. He took another drink.\n\nRight below the title and the byline, surrounded by faded text, was a picture. It was her. She was on a stage receiving a bouquet of flowers and a sash that said “Miss Mason County.” She held a friendly-looking puppet at her hourglass side. A dairy cow. He couldn’t be sure through the grayscale, but her ballgown looked pink—almost electric. Her hair was a lighter gray than the rest of the picture.\n\nMikey’s mind flashed with memory. On TV, she always kept her hair in a stone-stiff blonde beehive. Here, it was natural and flat. Her face was the brightest part. She was happy, or at least she was trying to be. In the caption, the journalist nicknamed her “Sunny Sandy.”\n\nMikey drank more of the cheap wine and kept reading. The article said that the woman was Sandra Alan. When she was in community college, she had won Miss Macon County and a scholarship to finish her degree in elementary education at the state school. The cow in the picture was her talent: Maggie the Magenta Moo Cow. On the day the article was published—June 22, 1999—her mother had just told the editor that Sandra and Maggie’s show *Sunnyside Square* had been picked up by the National Television Network. They wanted 20 episodes. Sandra had been in Los Angeles for 5 years, and she had finally caught her dream.\n\nMikey remembered it all. *Sunnyside Square* was about a girl named Sunny Sandy and her multi-colored menagerie of farm animal friends. One was Maggie, the cow from the picture. She always sang a song when the mail came. Another was the turtle from the picture: Tommy the Turquoise Turtle. Every episode, Sandy would help one of the animals learn how to be sunny. Whether they were sad, angry, tired, hungry, or hurt, Sandy fixed them.\n\nMikey had loved the show. He felt like Sandy understood him in a way that no one in the real world did. She knew that all he wanted to do was make people happy.\n\nMikey looked at her smile again. Even reduced to black and white, it felt like looking directly into the sun. Then he looked at her eyes. They looked at the audience—at him—like an old friend lost in time. Like a ghost who knew his name and saw him too clearly. Mikey finished the bottle and fell asleep.\n\n**\\***	**\\***	**\\***\n\nThat night, he dreamed of the park again. This time, he was *in* the park. The benches were still white, but they weren’t polite any more. They were like still specters surrounding him—their frames carved from bone. The trees were still green, but they had spread beyond ominous. Their branches formed cages in the air. And the wall—the wall that Mikey finally remembered Sandy and Tommy and Maggie playing on—looked like its bricks had been dyed in blood. Even through his sleep, Mikey felt relief when the park faded into pink. Then the drowning started again.', 'JLKeay', 'redditserials', 'https://reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1oq0uoa/sunnyside_square_part_2_tuesday/', 1, 0, '2025-11-06 21:47:32', '2025-11-07 23:40:41'),

That building is a condominium which would house 2,000 residents at most! Opposite the river, however, East Ginto National Pharmacy reported another incident in which tons of people killed 2 cashiers, 13 civilians, and even a policeman when they ran out of medicine and people rioted.

What about the Mayor??\" I asked.  \n \"He is trying his best in caring for his citizens. Unlike that western pig,\" my mother replied.  \n \"You know who\'s the pig?

I then went to the tricycle station and went to my school.  \n There, we had our flag ceremony and skipped devotion for a particular class was having practice. In our Music and Arts class, we didn\'t learn anything today as we\'ll listen to those who\'ll perform in the Chapel Hour tomorrow practicing.

Maybe it’ll help me make sense of it all and keep a solid track on my chronology of things. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar. I doubt it, but hey, the internet can be a strange place.\n\nFirst, some background. I’m not a crazy person. At least, I’d like to hope I’m not. I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m going to college.

They’re hard to describe, so I’ll pose you this analogy to give you the right foundation.\n\nI have a lot of these vague glimpses of memories, from when I was a very young child, of my own parents socialising, having a drink with friends, hosting events, whatever, where I’d wander downstairs to get a snack or something and I’d feel a little bit caught off guard for a moment by the sight of strangers in my house that my parents seemed to be getting on fine with. My parents would try to introduce me to their friend or cousin that I didn’t recognise, but I’d forget about whoever they were shortly after. I feel like a lot of people have early childhood memories like that, because when we were very young children, our parents were naturally younger too and were spending more time keeping up with friends and whatnot.\n\nSometimes, I’ll get a glimpse of something like a wine glass or a lit candle on a table and feel myself floating away, back into vague flashes and feelings of a dinner party my parents had one night with the in-laws or something like that. And that’s what I’m getting at: random feelings of recognition in your surroundings that give you hard to pin down senses of familiarity, leading you back to half-formed memories. But the way I experience it is a bit different. It’s not Déjà vu. It’s more like a stutter. A momentary glitch in my own perception. I like to call it static.\n\nIt usually happens when I’m run-down, sleep-deprived, or after smoking too much weed too quick. Like, for example, I’ll be lying in bed hungover, listening to the low hum of my desk fan, and for a split second, the hum will resolve. It’ll sound like a distant crowd of people cheering excitedly about something, or a woman singing a song in a different language. The weirdest part, then, is the feeling that follows. The absolute, bone-deep realisation that I’ve been listening to those noises for the last five minutes, I just hadn’t realised it yet. It’s like a retroactive certainty. My conscious mind is always the last to know.\n\nI’ve felt this “static” with sights, too. Like, a particular shade of peeling yellow paint on a bus stop that I gazed at for a few minutes before suddenly feeling sure I’d seen it on the wall of a hospital room somewhere I’d been in once when I was a kid. The feeling is never, “Hey, that looks familiar.” It’s “There it is again. It’s been here the whole time.”\n\nI’ve always written it off. A trick of a tired brain. My synapses misfiring. It’s always been so easy to disregard, because it was so rare. That was before everything that’s happened.\n\nHow it starts is I’d already been feeling hungover and out of it from the house party I’d been at the previous day. It was 2 pm by the time I was up from the couch. I started my day, just like Anthony and the others waking up at his flat, with a breakfast of leftover Chinese poorly re-heated in the microwave, a glass of Dr. Pepper from the bottle we’d been using last night for mixers, and a few bong rips. So, by the time we’d gotten ourselves sufficiently baked, it was 4 pm and I was walking to the bus stop with our group. Anthony’s flat is in an estate about a twenty-minute walk down some barren roads and suburbs away from the town where me and him grew up. We were walking with some of the other guys and gals from the party with the intention of getting a bus back over to where our community college is, an hour or so away, where most of us were living in student accommodation. But somewhere along the way, in the scorching heat of the day and our hazy state, we took a wrong turn. Even Anthony wasn’t sure exactly where we were. We had a loose idea, since we were still near the huge woods of the state park that enclosed around much of the area between Anthony’s estate and our hometown. As we kept walking and chatting aimlessly, we eventually stumbled upon a strange pub, a sort of half-bar, half-arcade that was set up across from an empty, dusty yard or lot. There were only a few run-down bungalows nearby.\n\nWe stared at the odd pub. I felt sure it was just a lame dive bar with a few arcade machines shoved in the corners to get 80’s nostalgic types all horny and drain them with shitty bar prices, but we were so bored and stoned that we saw the possibility of arcade games and freshly poured beers and thought, “Sure, why not.”\n\nWhile everyone spent the following hours throwing back drinks in our elegantly dishevelled state in that crummy place, a strange sense of premonition in my mind, and Anthony’s too, I think, seemed to have sprouted. A strange feeling of growing dread, a sense of anticipation for some huge revelation. That feeling kept growing, something completely unknown and yet undeniable, as time passed into evening and then nightfall, as I continued drinking, trying to make conversation with people, chatting with girls I liked the look of, normal bar stuff. I remember there was this fat, nasty spider in one of the corners of the ceiling. It hadn’t made a web, it was just slowly skulking about in circles. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.\n\nNow, my buddy Anthony is what you’d call an experienced tripper. He believes in expanding the mind, so to speak. I was always the cautious one. Anthony tapped on my shoulder late into the night and took me outside, where he showed me the tabs of acid he’d been talking about. I remember feeling that the moment was important. I mean that moment, standing outside that strange pub at night, staring across the road at that dusty yard and, behind it, the woods – I knew that I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. Even though nothing that special was really even going on. I knew I’d remember Anthony’s Marietta t-shirt. I’d remember the pile of tires scattered in the yard. I’d remember the rusty storm drain a few feet from where we stood at the pub’s entrance. We decided my first acid trip should be somewhere peaceful, in nature, so we picked one of the winding country roads around and through the state park woods, and started walking. Then we partook.\n\nThe come-up was fine. A little giddiness, the trees looking a bit more vibrant. Then I hit the peak. The world started to breathe. The asphalt of the road pulsed like a vein. Anthony was walking beside me, talking about the lifecycle of moss or something, his voice a steady, grounding presence. But then, a second voice started up.\n\nIt was also Anthony’s voice. But it wasn’t coming from beside me. It was inside my head, clear as day, as though he were sitting in an empty room right behind my eyes. He was commenting on my thoughts, narrating my panic.\n\n“He’s thinking about the fan now,” the internal Anthony-voice said as I looked in utter disorientation at the real Anthony, calm and conversational. “He’s wondering if it’s all connected.”\n\n I stared at the real Anthony. His mouth was moving, talking about how the universe is all connected and that means busting a nut and getting a girl pregnant is basically the same as planting a tree sapling. The voice of Anthony in my head, however, was speaking directly to me.\n\n“Dude, you okay?” the real Anthony asked. “You’re looking a little pale.”\n\nThat’s when I saw a third man off in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, standing off the path under the canopy of an ancient oak tree, was a man. He was tall, gaunt, looked to be in his forties, wearing a brown suit that looked decades out of date. He was just standing there, staring at the bark of the tree, running his fingers over it like he was reading Braille. There was something about his facial features, the exact movements of his hands. At first, it was just a vague sense of familiarity, and then I felt a spark within me. I felt those same feelings of static I’ve described throughout my life.\n\nSomething about a kid I’d known briefly in the early days of my childhood… his name was Douglas, I’m pretty sure. A third cousin, I think, or maybe a family friend’s son? Or was he some imaginary friend I had? No, he was definitely real, and he was in the family, but he wasn’t a close relative. I saw him maybe twice in my life. My one solid memory of him is from a family gathering when I was six. All the other kids were playing tag, but I found Douglas, who was a few years older than me, sitting alone by the creek. He was meticulously stacking these smooth, grey stones into a perfect, freestanding archway of sorts. Like a little depiction of a skyscraper jutting up from the ground. It was impossibly delicate. When he saw me watching, he didn’t smile. I thought it was cool and impressive, I remember, so I asked him how he’d made it. He just looked at me with these ancient, tired eyes and said, “It’s a door. But you mustn’t open it.” Then, he kicked it over and walked away.\n\nThe man standing underneath that tree was a grown-up version of Douglas. There was no doubt in my mind. I don’t know how I knew; I just knew it.\n\n“Anthony, I slurred, my tongue feeling thick. “Do you see that guy? Under the tree?”\n\nAnthony squinted. “What guy, man? There’s no one there. Hey, dude, constellations. They’re weird. It’s like they’re people in the sky. Or in the things between.”\n\nI didn’t understand what Anthony meant. It felt all wrong. I saw movement in the distance. The man – Douglas – turned his head slowly and looked directly at me. His face was a mask of sorrow so deep it felt geological. Like he wasn’t really a brain behind it all, just pure misery.\n\n*“This isn’t possible,”* I thought, my mind reeling. I realised how little this made sense, even if I was tripping. This couldn’t be Douglas. Douglas had only been a few years older than me as a kid. So this fortyish looking guy obviously can’t be him. And something else. My mom had told me about it years later. This memory took even longer to dredge up. It was the thought of constellations that brough it back to me. I don’t even know where the connection is in that. Douglas had had some mental break at some point, my Mom told me once years ago. He’s been in an institution since he was a teenager. He couldn’t even ne here right now, on top of him not being the right age. So why was my brain constructing all of this?\n\nAs I continued locking eyes with the stranger, as Anthony stared off into space beside me, the internal Anthony-voice answered that last question the second it’d occurred to me. “He’s the devil.”\n\nThe real Anthony was now looking across at me, concerned, asking if I needed to sit down. But in that moment, I knew two things for sure. The voice in my head was absolutely not my friend. And that man under the tree, whether he was Douglas or the devil or both or neither, was certainly real in a way that Anthony, the road, and the trees suddenly didn’t feel like they were. The filter wasn’t just down, it’d been torn off somehow, and I felt I could finally see the static that was there all along, even if I didn’t understand what that really meant.\n\nAnthony decided to call things off then, and we went and got a motel to wait out the rest of the trip, Part of me wanted to forget about everything, to pretend it just never happened or that, like Anthony said, I’d just gotten unlucky and had an awful first trip. But the other part, the part that’s been listening to the hum of the static my whole life, knew that wasn’t an option. The door was open, and I couldn’t just close my eyes on what was inside.\n\nComing down from the trip was like being thrown back into a world made of cardboard after seeing the real scaffolding and foundations underneath. Everything felt thin and fake. Anthony drove me home, freaked out. He was saying, “Dude you were just having a bad trip. Even though it sucks that it was your first time, it happens.” But he wouldn’t look me in the eye.\n\nThe problem is, it didn’t stop when the acid wore off. The filter was gone. Permanently. Now, the static was everywhere.\n\nThe first time it happened, I was making some coffee for myself. I was listening to the background noise of the *drip-drip-drip* of the coffee machine while going to the fridge for the milk. I realised the sound had, somewhere in the background, suddenly sounded unmistakably like the unintelligible voice of someone from long ago in my past. Some girl, I think, some girl called Molly from my elementary school that I hadn’t really been friends with and could barely even remember at first.\n\nI could suddenly make out what her voice was saying as it coalesced into three clear and whispered words before it vanished from my mind right as I’d realised it. And even today I can’t remember the tone of voice or punctuation as she spoke them, just the words themselves.\n\n*Ask your grandpa*\n\nI stood there, frozen, the carton of milk feeling somehow warm in my hand. This could’ve been nothing. It could’ve been exactly like before, just a random intense recognition, just like the moments of static I’d gotten in the past. “Ask your grandpa,” is a perfectly normal phrase in and of itself, after all. And it’s the kind of thing I might have a vague, mostly forgotten memory of someone almost completely irrelevant to my life saying once. And yet I felt sure that it wasn’t just a memory. I felt sure it meant something. That it was an instruction. I felt I had no real choice to make.\n\nSo I went to visit my grandfather. Me and Grandpa Francis have a good relationship. He’s seventy, but his mind is still mostly sharp, no signs of decline. He just gets a little wistful sometimes is all. I meet up with him at his house every few months to have a glass of something and a chat. He lives in a quiet, detached house about an hour away that smells of old books and liniment.\n\nI gave him a call and said I was passing through his neck of the woods and was wondering if he wanted to catch up for a bit. He was more than welcome to it. When I arrived, he ushered me inside as always with a firm handshake. I didn’t know how to bring it all up. I just tried to stay engaged with Grandpa’s initial small talk and questions as he poured us each a glass of Captain Morgan’s spiced gold, before trying to subtly pivot and steer the conversation over. I did the only thing I could think of and asked him casually enough if he had any interesting or weird stories from when he was younger. Grandpa Francis is full of stories, and swapping them is something we’d often do. He got a suddenly distant look in his eyes.\n\n“Well,” he said, and I could almost hear it in his relatively steady voice. Underneath the lazy composure, the sound of the cogs in his head gradually kicking into action.\n\n“There was my old friend Petey. This was back around when we were no older than you are now. Just two guys with everywhere to be and nowhere to go. The two of us, working in the old autoshop all day long. Boy, you remember how it was, amount of times you’ve seen that dump over the years. But I was always happy with how things were. Quiet, you know. No fuss. That’s the life I wanted. But Petey thought there had to be more to the world. More to see, more to feel, more to experience. Always more with that fella. God, Jack, you remember all the stories I’ve told about the road trips, and the hiking, and the folks we’d meet at bars… wouldn’ta happened without Petey. He rattled my nerves to no end but I woulda lived a less full youth without him, no doubt.”\n\nI leaned in. Grandpa had talked about his old friend Petey before. I felt this was going somewhere, but I played it cool. Grandpa took a sip and continued.\n\n“Petey would go exploring when he was free. Exploring the roads, the abandoned houses, everywhere. ‘Specially the woods, the big state park, not far from where that friend of yours lives, actually.” At that, I had to supress a chill.\n\n“Petey was stupid. You hear me? Stupid kid. Always poking his nose where it didn’t belong, hoping he’d find something new. And eventually, he found something alright. Something strange. He took me into the woods one summer day, wanting to show me.\n\n“It was a door,” Grandpa said after a pause. “Just a door, made of old, dark wood, standing all by itself in a clearing. No house, no was. Just this door. It was in good nick, fresh paint job on there, and the bottom of the doorframe was nailed securely into the topsoil of the ground, so it stood perfectly upright, just like a normal door. Petey, he was always the brave one, he walked right up to it.”\n\nGrandpa paused again, taking a longer sip. The house was silent except for the ticking of the clock. I realised I’d stopped breathing.\n\n“What does that make Petey?” Grandpa asked.\n\n“Stupid,” I answered, trying to force a jokey voice.\n\n“He gets closer and closer to the doorframe, and I’m thinking it’s a bad idea. I’m thinking he’s putting himself in danger. But, I mean, why would I even have thought that? It’s just a door. But it felt all kinds of wrong. Petey’s almost able to reach out and touch the door when it opens up. A man stepped out. Or, well, I suppose he was always standing in that clearing in the woods, behind the door. You wouldn’t call it stepping out of the door so much as walking through it. No way to know which way’s in and which way’s out, right?\n\n“He was dressed in normal enough clothes, but there was something wrong with his eyes. Petey told me later it was like looking into a well that had no bottom. He looked at us, and he had this expression of anguish on his face so profound it was almost alien. And then, his voice, it… it sounded exactly like the voice of someone I could remember, but I don’t know who. There was something about it that had been changed, something made poisonous. The whole clearing smelled like an electrical fire. “It’s worse inside,” he said. Petey fell back and grasped my arm and whispered to me like he just knew it, “He’s all bad.” And he was. We ran all the way home and never spoke of it again,” Grandpa finished. “I knew that day that the Lord works in strange ways, but I wonder sometimes, does the devil work in stranger.” He made the sign of the cross in an unfocused way as he gazed out the window. We both drained our glasses.\n\nI tried to keep myself in check while Grandpa and I carried on having a generally fine chat for the next ten minutes or so. I could tell it was time to leave. Grandpa was more zoned out now than before. We said our goodbyes. I knew why it was. He was brooding. I’d heard about Petey in a good few of Grandpa’s old stories from back in his day. If I was remembering correctly, Petey Jackson had died less than a year after that story Grandpa just told me, when he was around twenty. 1976. The exact details of his death are the only part that Grandpa himself had never actually told me. He’d never needed to. I’d heard it all before, because Petey’s death is still a mystery. I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove home.\n\nPetey vanished one day. After a day’s work at the autoshop, him and Grandpa parted ways as always, but Petey’s family never saw him come home. Only a few hours later, Petey was found naked and dead in a ditch by some teenagers who were out camping a whole state away. Petey didn’t even have a car of his own. Nobody had any idea how he could’ve gotten there on his own.\n\nI only knew about this part from Grandpa Francis, but a few weeks after that, a bartender in our hometown opened up for the day and set about to work one morning as usual before he noticed, in the dusty, barren yard across the road, there was a small, slightly damaged and pitiful looking fridge standing by itself. He\'d no idea who dumped it but wanted to get rid of it, since he thought it was an eyesore. He dropped it on his first attempt, and the door snapped open, spilling its contents. Stuffed inside that fridge had been some of Petey’s clothes, neatly folded and pristine. There were that clothes that didn’t belong to him at all in there too. A deck of magic the gathering cards, Petey’s baseball bat, and the shed skin of some kind of tarantula. Grandpa told me the bartender just left the fridge in the yard after that. Didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Grandpa called the police himself when he heard about the clothes and baseball bat, but nothing ever came of it. Petey’s death was never solved, and they never found out why his things turned up after the fact in that manner.\n\nWhen I got home, the investigation began. I’m in the process of working through my sociology thesis for my sophomore year of college. I’m used to research. I started digging into local records, old newspaper archives. I wasn’t looking for shit about “the devil” or “strange doors in the woods”. I was looking for patterns. And believe me, I found them. It took many, many hours of digging, but eventually I stumbled upon them.\n\nThe first was an article from 2016 about a boy a few counties away from my area named Douglas Pickman, who, not long after his sixteenth birthday, was committed to a mental institution after being found wandering in that same state park. I’d heard bits and pieces of the story before, though I was shaky on the details, trying to pull at threads I could mostly remember from overheard conversations as a child.\n\nDouglas had seemed disoriented and strange for weeks beforehand, according to his parents. They said he’d been refusing to eat anything that had colour. It was rice, bread, mashed potato and milk every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’d sneak out constantly at night, but there were no signs that he was meeting girls, partying, doing drugs, anything. His grades remained fine, near-perfect, actually.\n\nHe\'d sneak outside and just stand outside his first-floor bedroom window, staring out into the night. Why even bother going outside? By day, when he thought nobody was looking, they’d sometimes see him out on the road leading out from the house, stooping over, staring down into a particular storm drain. They’d heard once from a postman that he’d been whispering things down into the drain. One thing the postman could remember hearing was “I remember I was killing you but it’s all different inside”. Douglas’ friends at school said he’d kept trying to give away his things to them, saying he’d just be throwing them away otherwise. Things they knew he was proud of, like his signed band t-shirts and magic the gathering cards.\n\nOnce, his dad had heard him skulking about at night and went to investigate. He couldn’t find him in his bedroom or anywhere in the house for that matter. Staring out the window into the night – a terribly stormy one – lightning flashed for a few seconds. In the blue, white-hot light, illuminating momentarily the fields across from their house, he saw Douglas, a hundred feet away, running around carefree, going in and out from behind the many haybales scattered about. When the man got out to his son, he found him lying unconscious on the golden soil. He was wearing different clothes, somehow. Both his parents said they’d never bought or seen them before. They were old school, like 70’s high school style. There was a dead cat on the ground next to him.\n\nOne day he snuck out and never came back. There was a search, and a day later the police found him in those woods of the state park, having climbed up a tree and refusing to come down, claiming he’d “found where it sounds right.” He was violently thrashing a long, rusty nail at any of the officers who tried to pull him down. He was only collected after he’d started bashing his forehead against a thick, jutting stump in the tree branch and dented his skull, falling down onto the ground about ten feet below. He was apparently very lucky to survive and had done permanent damage to his skull.\n\nI suddenly remembered something else as I read – something my mother had mentioned to me years ago when she told me about all of this. The memory was still foggy, but I remembered her telling me something Officer Dell had said to her once. He’s married to a friend of my mom’s, Caroline Dell, so they know each other well enough. According to him, as Douglas fell from the tree, and after he landed before passing out from shock and blunt force trauma, he kept screeching incoherently. “Screeches like a fax machine”, Dell had said. I’ve got no idea what that could mean but it didn’t sound good. And one thing, intelligible in the screeching, over and over. “Where’s the boy?”\n\nDell said he seemed to be staring right at him, and his eyes were like “every pair of eyes he’d ever looked into but different.” And as he stared down at the boy being cuffed, he was startled when the air suddenly reeked of something like an electrical fire. All the other officers denied that detail when he mentioned it afterwards. A few months later, Caroline miscarried their child. As the doctors broke that information to them, Dell said he remembered that exact smell again, seeping into every crack of the maternity ward. He\'s never smelled it again, apparently. They never did end up trying again for a child.\n\nI’d no idea what to make of all this. It was all just strange things I could half-remember hearing about before, suddenly being spurred forward. But I felt sure it meant something, and it was plaguing me. I felt if I could get to the bottom of it all I might understand everything else that’d been happening to me, both as of late and throughout my life. The end of the article mentioned Douglas’ family’s – *my family’s –* long history of “nervous mental conditions”. I’d never heard anything about this before in my life.\n\nI dug deeper. Census records, obituaries, police blotters. A great-uncle of mine I wasn’t aware of who’d vanished on a hunting trip in 1952. A daughter of a *great*\\-grand-uncle who apparently died in a “domestic accident” after neighbours reported her screaming about a man in the attic. It’s all the same. An unnavigable breadcrumb trail of mental breakdowns and inexplicable tragedies, all leading seemingly to nothing, and yet it all felt connected somehow.\n\nIt\'s hard to explain how cagey I was at this time. It was getting more and more invasive to my daily life, too. Like, one time I was walking to my house from the college library where I’d been doing my research, when I saw that there was a dude walking up the street against me. Seemed like another college guy from the backpack and the direction he was headed, towards campus. Way off into the distance – this particular street is long and straight – he’s walking up towards me. As we kept approaching one another, he came more into vision and the guy’s face was now less hazy from the distance, He was starting to look exactly like a guy called Ritchie who’d been in my year back in high school. I hadn’t really been super close friends with him and I never saw much of him after starting college, since he hadn’t had any interest in it and went straight to working at his dad’s autoshop.\n\nThat made this kind of strange. Since Ritchie never went to college to my knowledge, why’d he seem to be going to campus with a backpack? But that was crazy talk. Ritchie – I was certain now it was him – could be going anywhere in this direction, with a backpack, for any reason, right? It’s none of my business. And yet I felt sure there was something to this, something that meant something.\n\nAnd then it got stranger, in a way. As Ritchie and I came even closer to each other, crossing paths at last, I realised I had been wrong, this guy didn’t actually look anything like Ritchie as I remembered him at all. As we fully intersected and crossed paths, I was left wondering what I’d just experienced. Whether this man was or wasn’t Ritchie, what was it about him that’d led my mind to conjuring all that up? He hadn’t actually done anything. As I thought about it, I couldn’t even remember exactly what Ritchie actually did look like. And, come to think of it, where was Ritchie? Did he even work at an autoshop at all? The only one around for miles is the one in my hometown, near Grandpas’ house, that he and Petey worked at.\n\nThis type of strangeness of thought and paranoia had been pervading my life ever since the experience during the acid trip. Little things like this kept cropping up throughout my day to day life, making me momentarily question my sense of self, and as it piled up it all felt both more and more disjointed and ontologically incompatible, and more and more like it was all connected, I just couldn’t work out why or how. It was like there was something truly, utterly terrible hiding somewhere just out of frame in the metaphorical TV screen that I was viewing my memories through.\n\nAnd maybe the more I’d began to remember, defences had been put in place and all these ominous, contradictory threads had been thrown at me. Maybe I was simply not supposed to remembered. I wondered if maybe my salvation was buried deep in my memories, too – what if all I had to do was keep trying to trigger more and more memories, because if I could just remember enough about something, I could get to the bottom of it all and expose whoever was behind it? But then, what would that something even be? And something else had been growing, a feeling that it was all going to be coming to a head soon somehow.\n\nAnthony found me at the campus library. He looked scared. “Jack, you have to stop this shit, bro,” he said, lowering his voice. He sounded the least stoned I’d heard him in a while. “I looked a bit into your family. This whole thing doesn’t feel like, just, a joke, or a weird hallucination or whatever. Everyone like you who’s gone down this thing, they’re gone. They’ve either disappeared or they… they killed themselves. You’re chasing some kind of ghost story that’s still making more.”\n\nI heard his words. I really did. But as he was speaking, the other voice of Anthony, the one from before, the internal one, was smoother, clearer. It didn’t even sound much like Anthony anymore, it was just a calm, neutral tone, but I knew it was the same voice.\n\n*“He is a guardian,”* it said, the voice full of hate and causing flashes in my mind of teeth, of hair, of darkness, spiders, asphalt. *“He keeps the lambs from the pasture.”*\n\nI didn’t tell Anthony what I heard this time. I thanked him for his concern and told him I thought I was getting over it all anyway. Inside my mind, however, the size of the rift that I’d instantaneously felt open up between us was like suddenly getting dropped into the Grand Canyon. I didn’t know what to think about anything anymore.\n\nThe signals were changing. They weren’t just commentary anymore. They’re, they’re *navigational*. Like, yesterday, I was stoned and watching a nature documentary. I hadn’t been to any of my classes or my job for a while. I was trying to put myself into a foggy headspace deliberately now, trying to elicit more and more of the static in my subconscious, hoping it might trigger memories that could reveal more clues to me. I’d been denying myself sleep, deliberately zoning out to music or the TV, getting high non-stop, I’d even been experimenting with binaural beats. As I was zoning out, high, reading some texts on my phone and absorbing the background noise of National Geographic, a generally quiet and easy cacophony had filled the room. Until the sounds from the documentary of flowing water, of rustling leaves, of chirping birds, all tightened, sharpened, and became that same hate-filled voice, like friction on a carpet.\n\n*The map the third drawer the green circle*\n\nI walked over to my desk, my body moving almost on its own. I pulled out the topographical map of the state park I’d picked up at their gift shop while I was driving home from Grandpa’s and all but forgotten about in the drawer. It was tucked into the third drawer. In the deep woodland, where Grandpa’s story had taken place, someone had drawn a small, precise circle in green ink. I don’t even own a green pen. I knew what was in that circle. I didn’t need to check the coordinates against my memories of the acid trip. I just knew. It was all coming together now, I felt. I was going to the woods.\n\nThat brings us to the reason for my post, folks. I’m not looking for answers anymore. I’m just leaving a record. A warning, maybe, for anyone else who hears the signal. Stop reading now, if you’re smart. Go back to your life. Consider the static nothing but.\n\nI went back to the woods. The green circle on the map was a pull I could never resist. The journey wasn’t like the first time with Anthony. There was no laughter, no intoxication, no adventurous feelings. This was like a funeral march. I told no one I was going. The woods were silent in a way that felt intentional, like the birds and the insects were holding their breath. I didn’t need the map at all. My own blood seemed to know the way, pulling me forward like a diving rod tuned to a lucid nightmare. The air grew colder, felt denser. The familiar panicky stutter in my perception I’ve experienced throughout my life was no longer a glitch, here. It was the dominant signal. And then, amongst all the thin birch trees and cracked beams of sunlight dispersing through the canopy overhead, I saw the door.\n\nIt was exactly as Grandpa Francis had described. A simple, freestanding doorframe of dark, weathered wood; no walls or house to be seen. It was just there. It was both the most utterly mundane and the most wrong thing I’ve ever witnessed. The sight of it radiated waves of something bad, just pure bad. There was something inherent to the doorframe, something hidden beneath the atoms in the different materials and components that made up its structure, something lurking within that sent my nervous system into a state or revolt. Something about the doorframe and its presence here violated reality simply by existing.\n\nAs I stood there, maybe ten feet away, the final broadcast from the signal came through. It wasn’t even a voice this time, more like a knowing, a sudden injection of utter truth. A data packet that an unknown force had suddenly downloaded directly into my soul for me. I understood. The door changed me. It changes us. It breaks our filters. When I saw who I felt, impossibly, was Douglas, I think the voice in my head of Anthony was telling the truth. In a way, I think it was. I must have seen the devil. I saw him, who had walked through the doorway and been change. He was perceiving everything like how I felt I could suddenly perceive everything. The weight of time, the memories trapped in the soil, the silent anguish of every living thing for miles. That must’ve been why it called him the devil, I thought desperately. It was the only word big enough to hold the terror.\n\nThe signal, the static, everything, I think it’s what’s on the other side of that filter. It’s the raw data of existence. Beautiful. Entrancing. Labyrinthine. Terrible. Unbearable. Stepping through the door would be to understand everything. To become a clear channel. I would know why Douglas built his stone archways. I would know the name of the woman singing in my fan. I would know what the rocks remember. I would also cease to be Jack. I would be a vessel, overflowing, forever drowning in an ocean, a psychic avalanche of disjointed truths. I stood at the threshold for a long time. I felt the pull.\n\nThe part of me that has always been curious, that has always listened, wanted nothing more than to step forward and finally, finally know. I thought of Anthony’s face then, full of fear. I thought of dead spiders curling up in on themselves. I thought of rusty nails and electrical heat and gnashing teeth and I thought of darkness, and I thought of life. I felt nauseous beyond belief and fell for a second to my knees. I thought of my grandfather, who lived a long, pleasant and normal life apart from one very strange day in the woods, because he’d ran away from this very clearing in them. I thought of the simple pleasure of a family gathering. Of getting high and goofing off with a friend. Of playing sports. Of brewing coffee in the morning. Of having a beer and awkwardly making small talk or catching up with someone.\n\nI made my choice. I turned my back on the door. I didn’t run, I walked. One foot in front of the other, away from the clearing, away from the silence, back towards the world of cardboard and whispers.\n\nI am home now. The world is quiet. The signal is gone.\n\nThat’s the lie I have to tell myself to get through the day. The truth is, the signal isn’t gone, I don’t think. I think I’ve done something permanent to my ability to receive it, whatever it really is. I had to. To survive. It’s like I’ve taken a weed-whacker to my own mind with a psychological scorched-tar policy. I’ve severed the connection and I’ve scarred the landscape.\n\nThe world feels grey. Flat. The colours are muted. Music doesn’t really feel like music anymore, more like an arrangement of notes and beats in an order that’s sonically pleasing to the human brain for whatever evolutionary reason. A joke is just a sequence of information drip-fed to build towards a reveal and punchline. I still laugh, but more in an “oh, that’s clever” kind of way. The deep, intuitive part of me that sometimes just felt sure of certain things is now silent. It’s a numbness that I think I will carry for the rest of my life.\n\nI saw Anthony yesterday. We had a beer. It was a slight bit awkward and stilted. He says I seem better. More grounded. I agreed and it was almost like old times between the two of us, but he doesn’t understand, will likely never understand, that I had to cripple a part of myself forever to achieve this peace.\n\nI am safe. I am sane. I am empty.\n\nThe door is still there in the woods too, of course. And sometimes, in the dead of the night, when the silence is absolute, I can feel the ghost of the static’s hum. A phantom limb of the soul. And I am filled with the most profound anguish and regret, so profound it feels almost alien, not for what I found but for what I had to destroy in myself to get away from it.\n\nDon’t look for the door. If you hear the static’s hum, learn to live with it. The only thing worse than hearing that signal is the silence you have to create to make it stop.', 'Swagemandbagem', 'creepcast', 'https://reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1omzp0v/only_once_have_i_seen_the_door/', 2, 0, '2025-11-03 09:05:23', '2025-11-07 23:40:41'),
(50, 'reddit', '1o0xpqw', 'Multiple insects are infesting my flat - what can I do here??', 'Okay this might take a bit of explaining because my situation seems to be more complex than it should.\n\nI moved into my flat about a month ago, and we live a few floors up if that’s relevant. Well, since moving in, I’ve come across silverfish, carpet beetles (we’ve no carpets??????) and TONS AND TONS of fruit flies.\n\nI immediately set up fruit fly traps, which helped most of the fruit flies (but theres lots so..) but then soon after, I found a carpet beetle larvae in my dinner which caused a full-fledged OCD spiral and I had to throw everything out, buy containers and zip-seal bags, and now can only eat a few “safe” meals (I’m still scared of pasta.)\n\nBecause of this huge anxiety (and also the fact that its not entirely hygienic) I wanna eliminate these issues. I spoke to the reception at my flat but all they did was give us a bottle of raid.\n\nMy main issue comes with the social aspect. I know who the main culprit is. Their food is left open, cut vegetables left out uncovered, cooked food or ingredients are left without lids or seals, etc. So there’s TONS of things drawing insects. Which means that if I get rid of the infestations now, there’s a high chance they might just come back, and quick.\n\nNow I don’t really talk to my flatmates, besides my partner, who brought up something that I had already considered. The majority of my flatmates are older, and international students. I’m a white Brit. My partner being from another country shed some light on the fact that in the UK, food such as rice is more filtered so people from other countries can be pretty desensitised to bugs in comparison to Brits. My worry is that in trying to subtly interfere with their food, or telling them that they’re attracting bugs, is that I could be interpreted as disrespectful, or even racist.\n\nI have already tried to bring up to her family member who’s often around, but I was kind of just brushed off? “Hey, these ingredients seem to be really old and are probably not good for all the insects around here” (ingredients had been there since before me). And I just got an acknowledgement and they were eaten soon after. But nothing else changed.\n\nI don’t know what to do about this. I’m planning on getting a higher shelf soon, but I’m kind of stuck in limbo otherwise. I’d love any advice.

September is a season where the amount of rainfall is relatively lower than that of the rainy season. September arrives after the monsoon. So, there are three major weather patterns during September.\n\n# Post-Monsoon weather\n\nIf you are trekking in September in the Annapurna Base Camp trek then you can experience the post-monsoon weather. Post monsoon is during the starting of September. There may be slight rainfall and the trail may get wet and slippery. However, the rainfall is not as heavy as that of the rainy season.\n\n# Stable weather\n\nThe weather is stable during late September. The monsoon clears out all the dust and dirt making clear and fresh weather for the trek. During this time of the month, the hills and forest look green with the clear blue views of the skies. Also, the panoramic views of all snow-capped mountains are much more visible without any disturbance.\n\n# Pre-winter weather\n\nSeptember is the pre-winter weather at the Annapurna Base Camp Trek. During this time, days are warmer and the temperature is mild. However, at night, the weather gets cold and chilly. Therefore, make sure to carry the necessary warm gear for the night while trekking to Annapurna Base Camp in September.\n\n# The temperature during Annapurna Base Camp in September\n\nDragging a maximum crowd from all over the world, September has the most pleasant weather with a reassuring temperature that comforts hikers. However, the temperature during the daytime and nighttime is a huge difference in Annapurna Base Camp Trek. At the base camp, September experienced pre-winter weather. At the base camp, late September is much colder than early September. The temperature during the daytime is mild and warm, but nighttime is very cold over there.

The tea houses are well managed and provide you with all sorts of services and facilities. The teahouse accommodations are not fancy like that of hotels but here you will find warmth and respectful behavior of locals.

Therefore, for camping accommodation, you need to bring warm clothes as the nights will be much colder.\n\n# Meals in Annapurna Base Camp in September\n\nTalking about the food option in the Annapurna base camp trek, you will have various options here. But the number of options gets limited as you trek higher in altitude. The trekkers will have three meals a day during the Base Camp Trek, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The guest houses and tea houses are run by the locals so, they will serve you some local dishes and most of the foods include the flour product. You can also eat some famous international cuisine too. Most of the tea houses have the same menus.\n\nThe food menu includes pancakes, fried rice, pasta, yak cheese, beans, Dal Bhat, Momo. Try to have a balanced diet food that can provide you with sufficient energy for the trek. To stay hydrated during the trek it is necessary to drink at least 4- 5 liters of water.

It is the starting season for the trek to the Himalayas. The trails start to get busier during early September. Presenting you with an astonishing view of the natural landscapes and entire Himalayan ranges, the base camp to Annapurna is the most popular trek of all.\n\n# Favorable Weather\n\nThe weather in September is quite favorable for fun, adventure, and trekking.

This way, you can also know about their beautiful traditions, rituals, and cultures. Also, during your trek, you get to interact with other trekkers from different countries and share life stories at the dinner table and lodges.\n\n# Season of Festivals\n\nSeptember is a season for celebration in Nepalese society.

It takes several days of planning and preparation to get ready for the trek. For the successful completion of the trek, the trekkers need to prepare their bodies well for the rough and tough trail that the true offers. Trekkers need simple preparation before starting a trek to any high altitude.\n\n# Physical Preparation\n\nWithout physical wellness and preparation, it is almost impossible to trek to a higher altitude. As the base camp of Annapurna lies at an altitude of 4130m your trail will be filled with various ascend and descend. You need to walk for an average of 6-7hours per day through rough trails. And anybody without physical fitness and wellness finds it hard to do so. So, to overcome such problems, maintain your physical stamina by engaging yourself in a light workout at least a month or weeks before the trek. One can start with light workouts such as jogging and gym classes to squats and high planks. Besides, Cycling and walking to remote areas can be helpful as well.\n\n# Mental Strength\n\nConsidering this trek as a moderate level, many trekkers ignore the mental strength needed for the trek. Like physical strength and stamina, it is equally important that a trekker is as good with the mental strength to put up with the hike. For a higher altitude trek, Altitude sickness becomes a real problem after 2500 meters altitude. You need to be mentally prepared that you may be caught by some of the symptoms of altitude like fatigue, slight headache. At that time don’t panic. Resting for some time makes you healthy and energetic. However, if the symptoms worsen you must stop the trek. Besides, you also need to be prepared to hike for 6-7hours a day without or few great days.\n\nHere is a list of things that you will need on Annapurna Base Camp in September\n\n* Rain Jackets (for early September)\n* Undergarment (moisture wicking)\n* Hiking shorts and Lightweight trekking pants\n* A sunglass with UV protection\n* Sunscreen creams and lotions for your face and body (preferably with high SPF)\n* Waterproof pants\n* Windproof jackets\n* A pair of comfortable hiking boots\n* Warm socks\n* Sandals\n* T-shirt (with and/or without sleeves)\n* Fleece jackets or pullover\n* Down jacket\n* Sleeping bags (good quality)\n* Trekking Poles (for ascents and descends)\n* Headlight\n* Basic first aid kit including bandages, some essential medicines, ointments against blisters, sprains, etc\n* Refillable water bottle and water purifiers\n* A day pack\n* Toiletries like toothbrushes, toothpaste, towel, multipurpose soap, face, and body moisturizer, toilet roll, wet tissue, antibacterial sanitizer gel, or hand wash.\n\n# Difficulties of Annapurna Base Camp in September\n\n# Wet Trails in Early September\n\nMonsoon ends in August however sometimes, the monsoon continues until September. Generally, the trekkers may experience light rainfall in the first half of September. Due to this, the trekking trail might get slippery and wet and can create difficulty in trekking.\n\n# Difficulty in Finding Accommodation in Late September\n\nAutumn is the peak season for trekking in Nepal and September lies in Autumn. Early September is a starting season for trekking so, there will not be many trekkers, and finding accommodation is not that much of a big deal. However, from mid-September, the number of trekkers increases, and lots of tourists from around the world flood to the Annapurna region for trekking at this time. But the number of teahouses en the Annapurna trek route is constant. So, due to limited accommodation options, you might have difficulty finding places to stay.\n\n# Colder Nights\n\nThe days are warmer in September however the nights are much colder. Temperatures at nightfall below 0 degrees. Most of the tea houses are run by locals, so it is similar to their own houses. Even though they will provide you with a proper blanket and warmth, the rooms in the teahouses do not have proper insulation. So, you might feel cold. Therefore, carrying your sleeping might be proper.\n\n# Rugged and Remote Trials\n\nThe roads are rugged and remote and if it is your first time trekking into the remote trails, this trek might be slightly difficult for you. The trail is rocky and highly remote. There are lots of ups and downs that you have to do in a single day. Also, stone stairs make most of the trekking trail.\n\n# Altitude Sickness\n\nAt an altitude above 2500m, there is a chance of altitude sickness. The Base Camp sits at an altitude of 4130 meters, it is very likely that some will suffer from altitude sickness due to sudden temperature changes. As you trek up higher, the level of oxygen decreases causing altitude sickness. Thus, you get ideas on the symptoms, causes, precautions, and preventive measures of altitude sickness.\n\n# Travel Tips for Annapurna Base Camp in September\n\nHere are some travel tips for traveling in September,\n\n* Starting early is the major key to a successful trek. If you start early there are low chances of getting hot with bad weather as well as you can fully enjoy the nature and magnificent view of peaks.\n* It can rain during early September in the mornings and evenings. So, rainproof gears will help. Also, for the colder nights, you must carry warm gears.

The extra cost for the base camp differs depending on the facilities and standard of service. Luxurious hotels and guesthouses often charge high which might cause a hike in the travel package.\n\n# What are the effects of extreme altitude?\n\nThe altitude sickness starts with the altitude of 2500m where the base camp is at 4130m. Therefore, it is very likely to get altitude sickness but not everyone goes through it. Try to acclimate with the increasing altitude. Sudden change in altitude may lead to altitude sickness. The low level of oxygen at high altitudes usually causes problems like shortness of breath, headache, and dizziness.

Solo trekking is very much possible during this time. These trails are full of people heading to the same destination. There’s nothing to worry about traveling solo as locals are just around the corner to help you.\n\n# Is the trek appropriate for beginners?\n\nAnnapurna is not an extremely difficult trek.

(52, 'reddit', '1oaempb', 'The Man in the Almond Groves', 'There’s this thing that happens when you drive through Central California, the really rural part. Groves of almond trees are planted in a lot of fields between corn, rice, and other crops. As you drive next to the grove, you can see all the way down rows of trees to the other end of the field for a split second. It depends on how fast you drive, but it sort of feels like watching an old film reel frame by frame.\n\nI say this because I’ve moved here a year ago with my parents and sister before my freshman year of high school. I found the rows almost hypnotic at first, gazing down them to see what changed.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I was riding in the car with my dad, and we drove past this random field of trees. Like usual, I adjusted my gaze so I could see down the row.\n\nIn the first row, I saw a dark figure I assumed to be a man, maybe a farmer or a field worker. The next row flicked by, and I could have sworn it was the same silhouette. Each row had a similar silhouette. I was confused but chalked it up that there must have been some farmers checking trees. Then the field ended, and the cornfield next to it didn’t show anything like that.\n\nWe got to the next grove, and I recoiled in surprise as I watched twenty rows go by with similar silhouettes at the end of them. Then another field of silhouettes. Then another.\n\n“Dad, are they doing something in the almond groves today?”\n\nHe glanced over at the passing trees. “No, I don’t know anything specific. Why?”\n\n“I keep seeing people down the rows.”\n\n“Hmm. Probably just checking irrigation lines. I don’t see anyone.”\n\nWe passed another field. More dark figures.\n\nA week passed, and every almond grove we drove by had silhouettes down the row. They were getting just a little bit closer to the car as I rode to and from school with my friend, Jackson. He was two years older than me, but we were in the same grade since he got held back a couple years growing up. We both liked heavy metal. Jackson and I had been two of the kids who hadn’t hit their growth spurts as we entered high school, and as a new kid, I didn’t do a very good job of making friends. However, we both hit our growth spurts two months into our freshman year. By the end of the school year, he gained about 20 pounds and grew 6 inches, and I grew into a lanky 6’ 2” freak.\n\nOne evening when Jackson couldn’t take me home from work, my dad brought me home.\n\n“How’s Jackson doing? You haven’t mentioned much about him lately.”\n\n“He’s doing good.”\n\n“How’d school finish out for him?”\n\n“I don’t know, good, I think. We don’t really talk about grades that much.”\n\n“What do you talk about?”\n\n“I dunno, movies, music, cars. Not grades.”\n\nI looked over into a grove as we drove past. The figure was there, silhouetted by the sun. Then it was closer. Each subsequent row it teleported closer to the road. My stomach dropped and my pulse thundered. Dark clothing. A medium built man. It was so close now. I struggled for breath and braced for the figure to jump through the car window as we passed the next row.\n\nThe field ended. I released a tense breath as the figure disappeared.\n\n“What’s wrong?” said my dad.\n\nI gathered my thoughts. “Nothing, I dozed off.”\n\nI kept my eyes on the road for most of the week. Sometimes I’d see the figure out of my periphery and then just stare at the floor. It felt like I was a toddler playing hide and seek by covering his eyes.\n\nAfter that second week of seeing it and nothing happening, my fear morphed into curiosity. I found myself excitedly looking out the window on the drive to and from school with Jackson. He caught me looking at it.\n\n“What are you looking at?” He wiped his face with his black t-shirt. It was already hot for the morning.\n\n“There’s this thing…in the trees. Down the rows. It looks like a person. I’ve been seeing it for two weeks now.”\n\n“Yeah I have too.”\n\n“You have?”\n\n“Yeah I tried to drive around and figure out who it was, but its kinda hard when you’re trying not to crash.”\n\n“Who? How do you know it’s a person and not a ghost or some trick of the light?”\n\n“I never said it wasn’t a ghost, but you can only see it in almond groves for some reason. Not peaches or walnuts.”\n\n“How long have you been seeing it for?”\n\n“A couple of weeks.”\n\n“You know anybody else who’s seen it?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Just me and you I guess.”\n\nWe pulled into the school parking lot, even though school was out. In an effort to get to know more people while staying as far away from high school drama as possible, I had decided to sign up for the cross country team. Our school was pretty terrible and could barely string together the seven guys and seven girls needed for a varsity squad of each. I figured I could be a slow seventh, but didn’t realize that training started with a running club in the summer heat before practices started in the fall. Still, running club was a good excuse to get out of the house two mornings a week before I went to work or hung out with Jackson. My parents didn’t approve of shuttling me around at six in the morning, so thankfully Jackson covered for me. He kept talking about wanting to lift weights, so he took this as an opportunity to use the school gym while I ran. This gave us a lot of time to speculate on the way to and from practice.\n\n“I bet it’s an alien.” He shook his nasty smelling protein shake before taking a swig.\n\n“How would you prove that?”\n\n“It can teleport, or make copies of itself.”\n\n“No it’s gotta be a ghost. Those seem like ghost things. And no one else can see it.”\n\n“You don’t know that.”\n\n“Nobody else is talking about it.”\n\nHe burped. “Yeah whatever.”\n\nWe got scientific about studying the entity in a way only two teenage boys could. We’d accelerate and decelerate to make the “frame rate” speed up and slow down to see if we could get a better look. We tried a whole bunch of routes. The trees had to be big enough. If the trees were shorter than six foot, it wouldn’t show up. It only appeared when traveling between speeds of 32 and 93 miles per hour. Though we didn’t learn much, it was a fun experiment. Pretty soon the silhouette felt like a fun game we messed with, something like that made-you-look thing guys in middle school could use as an excuse to punch each other.\n\nAfter the next practice, we stopped at a fruit stand on the way home from practice and talked to this Hispanic guy selling mangoes. He hadn’t seen anything weird in the trees. He was a cool dude, though, and those mangoes were good.\n\n“Maybe it’s a cult,” I said on a whim, mango juice gushing down my chin.\n\n“How would that work?”\n\n“I dunno, they make sacrifices, get powers, they’re specifically targeting us.”\n\n“MK Ultra, dude,” Jackson said, dripping juice on the already sticky leather seats.\n\n“Please not MK Ultra.”\n\n“What if these mangoes have LSD in ‘em or something?”\n\n“That’s dumb.”\n\n“This could have been a military testing facility where chemicals leaked into the ground and made everyone hallucinate.”\n\n“I’m not going to dignify that with a response.” We chewed as the 8:00 sun beat across the windshield and made us squint.\n\n“You’re right about one thing,” I added. “These mangoes are like crack.”\n\n“Yeah, we gotta get more.”\n\n“I’d blow my whole paycheck on ‘em.”\n\n“I’d steal your paycheck to buy ‘em.”\n\n“I’m the one who paid for them in the first place.”\n\n“Yeah, your mom always said you were a sucker.”\n\nI punched him hard in the arm, and he spit onto the steering wheel.\n\nCross country treated me ok. I lost a couple pounds in the first few weeks even if my diet was still crap. Most of the guys were dorks or geeks. They kept asking if I had seen obscure Youtube videos from 2011 or Dr. Who. I was surprised that I was able to keep up with them, given their gangly physiques looked built for long distance running. It was only once I met some of the girls I stopped thinking of cross country as social suicide. Particularly one of the juniors, Sophia.\n\nSophia, forgive my hyperbole, was perfect. You might disagree with that, but blonde girls in ponytails and running shorts are exactly my type. But it wasn’t just that she was my type. She was so…nice. Our first conversation was the first time I had talked to a girl and hadn’t seen her pull up her nose in disgust.\n\n“I like your shoes,” she said as we stood next to each other in preparation to start our run.\n\n“Thanks,” I flatly replied.\n\n“Where’d you get them?”\n\n“Um, shoe store.”\n\n“Which one?”\n\n“Uh. I don’t remember.”\n\nShe ignored my stupidity. “I like the colors. Sky blue and tan look good together.”\n\n“Really? I thought they were kind of bland. I just grabbed the first pair that wasn’t a neon eyesore.”\n\n“No I think they’re cute.”\n\nCute? I scrambled for an answer. “Is that a good thing?”\n\nShe grinned and tilted her head to the side. “Cute is great! You’ve got good taste.” How could anyone be this happy at 6 am?\n\n“Well if you like them…” I said, uncertainly, my face feeling red.\n\n“Like I said, they’re great.” With that, coach told us to start. She started her watch and ran away with my breath.\n\nAs I climbed into Jackson’s car after practice, he noticed me looking at her.\n\n“So you joined the team for the babes? You sly dog!” He razzed me. “Which one you got your eye on?”\n\nI was turning a deep shade of red. “Um…you know Sophia?”\n\n“What? Dang it, dude! I was way into her!” he protested.\n\n“Oh, sorry man. I’ll-“\n\n“Ha! You should have seen your face!” He grinned. “No, dude, I’m not into her. Now the Latina chicks at the gym…ooh man, you should see the curves. Not like these skinny girls.”\n\n“Whatever dude. I’m hungry.” I disliked how he often talked about girls that way.\n\nWe peeled out of the parking lot and started the drive back to my house, taking a route we hadn’t gone before to go get some breakfast. As groves passed by on both sides, I thought of a new test.\n\n“Hey, if we look out opposite sides of the car, would there be two figures?”\n\n“Good one! Let’s see how many of those cultists there are!”\n\n“You said that was a stupid idea.”\n\n“What the heck? I can’t change my mind on it?” He invited me to verbally spar.\n\n“Just look out the window.”\n\nWe looked out opposite sides of the car. There was a silhouette on my side.\n\n“You see it?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah it’s a hot Latina girl now.”\n\nHe was getting on my nerves. “Shut up.”\n\n“Fine. It’s still there. You?”\n\n“Yeah. Same as always.”\n\n“Guess that means we’re both cursed.”\n\nWe sighed. My mind felt fuzzy as I stared at the silhouette in another passing grove. It was like I was trying to look at something too far away between too many layers of glass.\n\nI went out and bought a watch the next week for cross country practice after my coach told me to. I had saved up enough for one of the fancy smart ones, even though I didn’t have a lot of uses for it. It came with a few swappable bands, but I didn’t care, so I stuck with the sky blue one that came attached.\n\nSophia looked pleasantly surprised when she saw it. “You got a watch to match your shoes?”\n\nI shrugged as I glanced at both. “Didn’t plan it.”\n\nShe giggled. Her nose scrunched when she did that. “You must have some divine guidance then.”\n\n“Just lucky, I guess.”\n\n“Do you like it?”\n\n“I dunno, this is the first time I’m wearing it.”\n\nShe smiled. “I’m sure you’ll be faster now. I felt like it when I got mine.” She held up hers, the same model with a lighter blue strap.\n\n“Woah, look at that, twinning.” I held mine up next to hers. Her hands were tiny compared to mine. “Maybe it is divine guidance.”\n\nShe smiled. Coach told us to start, and I felt like I was floating instead of running when I thought about her. She continued to steal my thoughts while riding home with Jackson.\n\nHe broke the silence. “It’s getting closer.”\n\nMy head whipped out of a daydream to look out the window. The silhouette was probably twenty yards from the road now.\n\n“You see it?” Jackson asked.\n\n“Yeah. That’s a lot closer.”\n\n“I think I can see some details, dude. For some reason, it looks like a Hispanic guy.”\n\nThere was no way he was serious. “What do you mean?”\n\n“No I’m serious.”\n\n“You’re not pulling my leg?”\n\n“No why would I be pulling your leg?”\n\nI couldn’t see my side well with the sun rising behind it, but I didn’t think it looked like a Hispanic guy. Even though the face and hands were shadowed, the skin didn’t look dark enough.\n\n“Looks like a white guy to me.”\n\n“What? Clearly his skin is somewhat darker than ours.”\n\n“No, I’m telling you, it looks like a white guy.”\n\n“Ok whatever. You’re looking at the sun anyway.”\n\nIt was a long weekend afterwards that Jackson and I didn’t hang out because of work. I spent a lot of time daydreaming about Sophia.\n\n“Hey, you doing anything for the 4th of July?” Jackson asked on the drive to the next practice.\n\n“I don’t know. Probably watch some fireworks. My parents are chaperoning a girl scouts trip out of town for my sister.”\n\n“Wanna watch a movie? My parents are gonna be gone.”\n\n“Let me see. I’ll check and get back to you.”\n\nAs I was getting done with my run, hands on my knees and breathing heavily, Sophia walked over to me.\n\n“Hey, we’re having a pool party at Ella’s house on the 4th and the whole cross country team is invited. You wanna come?”\n\nAdmiring the sparkle in her eyes, I replied without thinking. “Yeah sure! Um…do I, uh, bring a swimsuit?”\n\nShe tilted her head to the side and laughed. “It’s a pool party; of course!”\n\n“Oh, uh, yeah, ok.” I huffed. “My brain, uh, needs some food to start working again.”\n\n“Well we’ll have pizza and snacks there, so come hungry!” She giggled and scrunched her nose. “See you there!” She turned and jogged away. My gaze lingered on her.\n\nBack in the car with Jackson, the AC was struggling to keep up, and I was gulping down all the water I had. “Hey, so about the 4th…”\n\n“Yeah?” he said, mouth breathing. His black tank was already sweaty from his workout.\n\n“I, uh, got invited to a pool party…by Sophia.”\n\n“Cool.”\n\n“That’s ok?”\n\nHis tone was downtrodden. “Yeah man, go hang with girls. We can hang out after.”\n\n“That’s true. I don’t think it’s gonna go super late. Thanks man.” I had to justify to myself that he was ok with it. I changed the subject as we passed a grove.\n\n“So how’d you figure out it’s a Hispanic dude that’s haunting us?”\n\n“I don’t know, dark hair, tanner skin. He got really close to the car one time last week.”\n\n“Like how close?”\n\n“Probably 10 yards from the road. I could see his face a little.”\n\n“What’d it look like?”\n\n“I dunno, kinda sad. Had a beard or a mustache. But mostly just shadowy. Looking at the car go by.”        \n\n“Where’d you see this?”\n\n“Over on Turlock Road.”\n\n“Can we drive over there quick?”       \n\n“Yeah whatever. Can you at least grab me a protein bar out of the glovebox?”          \n\nWe drove there. The grove he was talking about had shallow rows, but a lot of them. Our silhouetted friend was jumping towards me with every row as Jackson hit the sweet spot of 32 mph. The sun was coming up from behind the mountains and backlighting the figure. I squinted into the sunlight as it got closer and closer. Black clothes. Dark silhouette. Dark hair. But the skin seemed lighter. It was so close to the car. The sunlight washed out the face. So familiar for some reason. The field ended.\n\n“I don’t know, dude. Didn’t look Hispanic to me.”\n\n“Whatever dude. Just keep saying it’s aliens.”\n\n“Hey, we still haven’t ruled out a demon. Maybe we gotta recite a prayer and it will go away.”         \n\nHe let out a sigh. “Can I just go home? I’m tired and hungry.” I expected him to jump at the chance for more investigation but obliged his request.\n\nThe 4th of July couldn’t come soon enough. My parents dropped me off at a mansion with the intent that Jackson would pick me up. Ella’s house was way too nice, with a huge pool in the back, complete with a covered porch, mini bar with a fridge, diving board, waterfall, and jacuzzi. Probably thirty people mingled around the pool, including the whole cross-country team. I grabbed some pizza and engaged in nerd talk with the other cross-country guys before I got tapped on the shoulder.\n\nSophia stood there, glowing in the sunlight, a sky-blue bathing suit against her tan skin. She was right. Sky blue and tan went well together.\n\n“You made it!” she said, giving me a side hug. I turned red, and not from sunburn. She smelled like sunscreen and flowers.\n\n“Yeah, I did. And I, uh, wore my swim trunks.” The new shorts were kind of itchy.\n\n“I like them! And they match your watch!” she said.\n\n“Huh, guess I got lucky again,” I said, fist pumping in my mind that she had noticed.\n\n“Are you gonna swim?” she said, tilting her head to the side.\n\n“Don’t I have to wait thirty minutes after eating?”\n\n“That’s a myth,” she giggled. “Besides, I’m sure someone would save you if you were drowning.”\n\nWe swam for a while as people jumped off the diving board, guys roughhoused, and girls lounged and chatted. I met a bunch of Sophia’s friends, who seemed nice. As the sun got lower, people migrated to the jacuzzi or the bar, but Sophia and I sat on the edge of the deep end.\n\n“So why’d you join the cross country team?” she asked, the pool light giving her a flattering glow.\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “Didn’t want to get hurt while still playing a sport. Seemed like a good way to meet people.”\n\n“You could trip and fall and break your head open,” she said.\n\n“I don’t think I’m that uncoordinated. I manage to walk around without falling over most days.”\n\nShe giggled and kicked her feet in the water. “I’m glad you joined the team.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said. “Thanks for making me feel welcome.”\n\nShe smiled. Her eyes sparkled in the dimming light.\n\n“Hey, um,” I said, “Can I ask you a question?”          \n\nHer eyes got big. “Yeah, sure!”\n\n“Like, a weird question.”        \n\n“Yeah…”\n\n“I mean, it’s really weird.”      \n\n“Well you’re being really weird right now,” she teased.\n\n“Ok whatever.” I leaned in toward her. She leaned in towards me. Her skin looked so smooth.\n\n“Have you ever seen anything strange in the trees around here?”\n\nHer face got puzzled. “What do you mean?”\n\n“Like strange stuff while driving around almond groves?”\n\n“No…what do you mean?”\n\nI explained to her what Jackson and I had been seeing and how it kept changing. She had never seen anything like it.\n\n“Yeah, Jackson and I can’t figure out what it is.”\n\n“Does that scare you?” she said.\n\n“I don’t know. It’s just kinda normal now.”\n\n“You said you were seeing different things?”\n\n“Jackson said it was a Hispanic guy, but it looks like a white guy to me. Bulky figure, wearing black. Kind of hard to see with shadows.”\n\n“You sure you aren’t seeing two different things?”\n\n“I guess we just assumed it was the same.”\n\nShe looked hesitant. “Well, I mean, it kind of sounds like you were describing Jackson.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Yeah, dark clothes, bulky. You sure you’re ok?” She put her hand on my forearm. Our eyes met. I leaned toward her. She smelled like the pool and sunshine.\n\nTires screeched into the driveway, and someone laid on the horn over loud music. Sophia whipped her head around at the noise. Then the yelling started.\n\n“Hey Anthony! Hey! Let’s go! I gotta-!” I didn’t catch the rest of Jackson’s yelling over the rev of the engine. All the eyes at the party shot toward me. I scrambled up from the edge of the pool, embarrassed and quickly turned to Sophia.\n\n“I’ll, uh, see you at practice next week.”\n\nShe looked beautiful and uncertain as I turned my back on her, grabbed my stuff, and toweled off as I jogged around the house.\n\n“Anthony, come one!” he honked again.\n\n“Dude, what the hell?”\n\n“Dude let’s go for a drive then watch some fireworks.”\n\n“Ok, um…”\n\n“Come on, man, we gotta go!” He seemed so convinced. His eyes looked weird, and he was bouncing his leg. I got in the car, fastened my seat belt, and he peeled out of the driveway.\n\n“Where are we going, Jackson?”\n\nWe pulled onto a minor highway at a speed I wasn’t comfortable with.\n\n“Just around, dude. I just want to drive.”\n\nHis pace picked up even faster. I gripped the console and the handle above the door as we barreled past side roads. Most were empty.\n\n“Hey can you slow down?” I said.\n\n“How’d it go with Sophia?”\n\nI was caught off guard. “It was…good. She likes me, I think.”\n\n“Huh.” I barely heard the grunt over the metal music.\n\nI turned it down. “I was thinking about asking her out before you showed up.”        \n\n“Yeah, dude, she’s hot.” He didn’t look at me.\n\nFields whisked by. “Where are we going?”\n\nHe turned onto a side road that narrowed between two groves of almond trees. “I just wanted to go for a drive with you.”\n\n“Ok, but where are we going?”\n\nHe laughed. “I don’t know!”\n\n“Shouldn’t we figure that out? I don’t want to get lost.”\n\n“I’m sure we’ll find our way back.”\n\nHe wasn’t making any sense. “Why are we driving?”\n\n“Just to drive.”\n\n“But why? Is something going on?” I left off “with you.”\n\n“No, man. I just wanna drive.”\n\nI gave an exasperated sigh as I turned to the window. The sun was an orange ball just touching the horizon. It pierced through the trees and shown perfectly down the rows, casting long shadows in the trees.\n\nThe silhouette was gone.\n\nI turned back to Jackson just in time to see a pickup truck run the stop sign at the intersection about a hundred feet in front of us.\n\nWe must have hit the truck twenty miles over the speed limit. I became weightless as the car flipped over its nose and over the truck. My head slammed into the support column as we rolled, and my neck whipped against the headrest. Glass sprayed across the cabin, cutting my cheeks and arms. My feet came unglued from the floor on the second roll. My ankle bent the wrong way as it caught on the bottom of the glove box. I heard a crunch as the dashboard buried the other leg. My vision swam as the car slammed into a tree and almost folded in half, whipping me against the dash now crushing my midsection. As my vision reoriented, the car came to a stop on its side, my door now pinned on the ground.\n\nFrom where we had landed, I could see directly down the row of almond trees as the sun’s last light sank below the horizon.\n\nSomething dripped on my cheek. I looked up to Jackson’s still face, mouth and eyes wide open. Blood was dripping from his mangled arm onto me, a slow pat, pat, pat.\n\nPain overwhelmed me as the sun’s glow faded from the sky. I melted away into darkness.\n\nJackson had been killed on impact. His neck snapped as the car flipped over its nose. I woke up a week later with 2 broken legs, a torn meniscus, cracked ribs, a broken arm, whiplash, and a major concussion. Safe to say I’m going to miss the cross-country season.\n\nThe guy in the truck died after he was thrown from the vehicle into a nearby tree. He was a farmhand here on a work visa from Mexico.\n\nIt’s been two months since the accident. I’ve spent most of that time laying in a dark room hoping one of these days my head stops hurting. Sorry if this account seems a little disjointed. Sometimes I only have enough focus to write a few words at a time.\n\nI haven’t seen or spoken to Sophia since the 4th of July. The colors of that night bleed together every time I try to think about it. Jackson’s hollow eyes are etched into my mind. I just keep wondering what I should have done.\n\nOn a drive to the hospital for a checkup, I noticed they’ve started planting an extra row of trees along the road in the groves. It maximizes land usage, I think, but it also breaks up that picture effect of passing tree rows. Hopefully it keeps anyone else from seeing a silhouette in the trees. Or at least they don’t have to see it coming.\n\n \\*Please don\'t share or reproduce this without my permission.\\*', 'Aggressive_Big3236', 'horrorstories', 'https://reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1oaempb/the_man_in_the_almond_groves/', 8, 0, '2025-10-19 08:44:49', '2025-11-07 23:40:41');

(53, 'reddit', '1ocrvof', 'To see the dance', '\n\nA decrepit, moss-filled village filled with laborious men, sweating in the sun, was not a sight to behold. Or to be spoken of - in such honour or in fashion. Who speaks of these, the ones who grow your potatoes, or tomatoes, or anything that you eat - for the ones who label them, market them and sell them - are more famous. \n\nIt was rainy these days, and the tribals, on account of some respect for the rain - choose to dress up and dance - which sometimes you could see on the hill far away. It was a huge green forest, spreading miles, and above, stood a few beings dancing like they believed the rain was divine or something. Down in the valley villages, we never believed in such things. Not that the rain wasn’t important, or wasn’t as essential to us as to them - but usually, we believed in God rather than rain.\n\nI stood there waiting for the tribals to dance, and catch a glimpse of them. \n\nMaybe you could say it was because everyone always said the tribals came out to dance up over the hill. But no account, to my knowledge, was directly primary. No one had seen the tribal dance with their eyes. But apparently, many details of the dance were already available to us. Especially the fact that the dance was performed when it rained. The current drizzly weather, with cool fresh breeze emerging from the green all around - seemed perfect for this. \n\nAll of a sudden, the breeze turned a little grey, a little waxy. I heard a certain unusual rumbling coming from somewhere behind me. I looked back, only to see a white government car reaching up to me. I gave way, but shifting to one side of the road. The car stopped near me, and the driver began rolling down the window.\n\n\n\n“Where’s the village?”, he said, in a stern, bold voice.\n\n\n\nThe man was stout, fat and balding - but unusually pale for an Indian; he looked well-dressed, but not as much as the man in the seat behind. I hadn’t noticed him at first, but I caught a glimpse when the windows rolled down.\n\n\n\n“Not up here.” I said. The village didn’t have roads and wasn’t connected to it.\n\n\n\nThe man in the back gave a grunt and dabbed his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief. He said calmly, “Turn around” \n\n\n\nAnd the car went back. The tribals were not visible, like always, and I had to get back to the village before sunset too, so I started walking in their direction. And soon the little white ambassador was far from sight, like a speck of white dust in a huge backdrop of green. \n\n\n\nThe birds too were getting back to their nest in huge flocks - the crows being particularly visible. As evening began to creep, all animals began to retreat back into the jungles.\n\n\n\nAs I reached the village, I saw the village children playing in the mud. I couldn’t help but remember my own fun times. Back in the days, we played all day, and were almost always in pure joy. these children were the same. They made a circle in the mud with a stick, and danced on the edge of this circle. Their dance comprised of a sequence of moves, from the lifting of arms, to the bending and jiggling of the ass and then a step taken in front. The children were all aligned in the circle, and would giggle to deaths when the jiggling move came up. Apparently they copied the tribal dance as the village elders had described to them a few months back. \n\n\n\nThe village elders gathered around the banyan tree, holding their white loincloths up to their knees, and seated with back straights, the women chatting and gossiping, occasionally letting out a roar of laughter when one of them ended their monologue, all were very common scenes in our village. The children dancing were always bare-chested and were just boys. The girls actually used to sit separately, somewhere near their own mothers, grandmothers and aunts, watching them closely and making a sort of mini-gossip group. It’s not like the girls wouldn’t have liked to mimic the dance; but somehow they never got the approval to do so. \n\n\n\nThe village elders looked at me as I passed them and one of them screamed, “Binsu! Come here!”. Well, I didn’t have a choice but to go to them. If I didn’t, I could be certain that my marriage wouldn’t take place because of these *buddhas* ostracising me. I went slowly, looking as stern and busy as possible. I greeted them with a smile. The elders looked at me, and laughed. I was confused. \n\nI scratched my head. “What happened?”\n\n\n\nNattu, the village eldest and the *Sarpanch* said, “Your face is weird as ever! Funny man!”. Nattu then adjusted his *dhoti*, which began to touch the muddy ground.\n\nI first let these last-lifes have a last-laugh. Then, I replied, “Nattu Kaka, Don’t laugh so hard, your *dhoti* will fall off, old man!” Everyone, except Nattu, began to laugh. Nattu was visibly reddened, and he murmured “I’ll show him when the time comes”. I said, “Anyways, I gotta go now, I’ll take your leave”. And I left as quickly as possible, to prevent Nattu from getting a last minute comeback.\n\n\n\nI bought some onions from Boghu’s shop near my house. Boghu was very unlike Nattu Kaka - he was really dusky, just like his mother - and very muscular. He was clean shaven and a really nice person - never got angry, or jealous and was very timid in behaviour. Boghu was the son of Nattu Kaka, who was disowned because of an inter-caste marriage, so there was always a friction between them in the village - but both were largely respectable in the village. We were in the same school, and I even knew his wife actually. Somehow we weren’t very close in childhood, but he had become a good friend now. I sit with him every alternate evening and chat with him at his shop. There aren’t many avenues for men to chat and release stress - unlike the elderly, women or children. \n\n\n\nI had already boiled some rice for lunch, so I just ate some rice and onions. Then I put off my lantern and got ready to sleep. In this monsoon season, moss often grew on your back when you slept, so I had to apply oil on the floor before I slept on it. I took a few drops of mustard oil and smeared it on the red mud floor and carefully placed my back on it. Soon, I was asleep.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe next morning, a commotion awoke me. As I hurriedly got up and peeked outside the door, a few men were gathered around by the villagers. I joined the crowd, to see that the same man and driver, who I’d given directions to, were standing in the centre of this perplexity. \n\n  \nThe driver waved his hands wildly. “It’s a S-U-R-V-E-Y and not a Sherbet. There’s no sherbet here! Nobody’s distributing sherbet! Get back!” \n\nClearly, this had no effect on the villagers, who were determined to get their sherbet from the Officers. \n\nThe driver continued, “This is the District Magistrate! Go back!” And hearing the word DM was enough to push the villagers a little back, only for Nattu kaka to emerge in front. \n\nI ignored all of this, and went back to my house. A neem tree grew near my house, and no one claimed it, so I did. I took a small branch, and began chewing on it, behind the house. Suddenly, a man came up to me saying Nattu Kaka has called me. I went to front of the house again.\n\n\n\nNattu Kaka suddenly grabbed my shoulder and said, “Go with these officers up to the hill and show them where the tribals live. You’re always so fascinated about them”. I really had no intention of doing this, and I bypassed Nattu Kaka and called on the Driver, “Will I get paid?” I made this weird expression with my hands indicating counting of money, which in hindsight could be termed disrespectful - but I got away with it. The Driver nodded, flashing his bald head.\n\n\n\nAnd I agreed immediately. \n\n\n\nThe Driver explained later that the DM and a doctor from a nearby village needed directions to the top of the hill where the tribals lived. I had never seen the tribals, and I’m sure nor did the DM or his driver or the doctor - but I could guide them at least.\n\nI explained the kind of things they would need for the trek - water bottles, bag packs, some food till evening, a match, some oil and a torch. I waited in the \n\n Panchayat Office and stared at the vast paperwork they possessed. I wondered what was this paperwork of - since they hardly ever did any work, Nattu Kaka and others. Actually the paperwork was more useful to the children. The waste copies were stolen by the village children to make notebooks for their schools. the school headed by a weak headmaster - very passionate, I must say - but nobody cared for him and his passion. I suggested them to get the stuff procured from  Boghu’s *kirana* shop. Boghu gave me a cut for every such recommendation. \n\n\n\nThe officers got the stuff - hopefully from Boghu - and we were off.\n\n\n\nAs we went up the hill, the sun began to shine above our heads, and realising I had forgotten to tell the Officers to bring a towel to cover their head in the noon heat - I gave up mine for the DM. I didn’t even need it at this point - it was more of a habit. The entire journey was mostly a monologue of the Driver - about really random stuff - sometimes his favourite Bollywood actresses, sometimes the reason behind the colour of the sky and sometimes his mother’s knee operation. I wondered how the DM could handle such a nuisance, the driver was. However, the highlights of the trek up definitely were the DM getting sick and vomiting, and the driver panicking because of this, and more because the water seemed to get over. The Driver kept a lot quiet after this overt gesture of puking demonstrated by the DM.\n\n\n\nI kept a watch for the tribals, and even a single sighting would be enough for these guys, I thought to myself. I was leading the way, and the trail kept getting narrower. A few nicely arranged stones here and there threw me off and I was about to give a false alarm of a sighting - but I reminded myself that these Officers would probably need something more tangible as evidence. They probably wanted to actually meet a tribal. i hadn’t done it myself after so many years - and one fine day, these 3 idiots want to do it. I chuckled. I gave a quick look to make sure they were there.\n\n\n\nI caught a glimpse of the doctor getting tired. I offered him to take some rest. However, the doctor was exceptionally quiet, and too blank, to be fair. In fact, I can’t even remember his voice, until the very end when we did find the bones of the tribals. \n\n\n\nYes - the tribals were dead - and the doctor hypothesised a disease, whose name I can’t even pronounce - to be the cause of their deaths. The doctor was saying that the disease would have been so deadly, that it was impossible for the tribals to have not been all killed. But there was a certain hesitation in his voice - some words that seemed left inside his stomach. I noticed it, but the others didn’t - so I ignored it.\n\n\n\nIt was getting dark - and too late to actually find these bodies. I suggested we descend back, which was the majority opinion before I had to say it. \n\n\n\nDownhill was easier. We were back before midnight and Nattu Kaka was waiting eagerly for us at the Panchayat Office. I was going to go with them into the Office, when the driver suddenly stooped me and coldly said, “Thanks! I think we’re done here.” Something private, I thought to myself. Who cared? I had collected my payment as advance before the trek, so I wanted to go back home. But something in me - something patriotic - maybe as a citizen of the country or just this curiosity to know - begged me to hide behind the tree near the Office window to eavesdrop. I wanted to evade this persuasion - but I gave in. I slowly circled behind the office, and lead my ear to focus completely on the noises from the building.\n\n\n\nNattu Kaka’s voice shook. “But they’re all dead!”\n\nThe driver replied, “Yes, we know. But the tribal welfare funds will stop coming if we declare them dead!”\n\nThere was a pause. The Driver continued, “I understand your concern, but nobody will catch this. The DM is right here with us. We will reward you with a share too.”\n\nAfter some more resistance, Nattu Kaka gave in. I could hear some ruffling of some papers. The Driver tapped the paper sharply. “Sign here. Write “ALL HEALTHY” in capital letters.” The doctor made no sound, at least none I could hear.\n\n\n\nYou would think my blood would boil or I would be angry at these open scene of corruption. But not really. I didn’t care much. I went back to my home, and soon the officers were gone. I bought a soda from Boghus shop later in the evening with my money, and enjoyed my evening. The village elders, except Nattu Kaka, were still there laughing. The women still gossiping and the children dancing weirdly in red mud. \n\n\n\nAs I sipped the soda, I saw a small child, bare-chested and brown, covered in mud walk with confidence with a sheet of paper in his hand. There was a yellow pencil stuck behind his ears, the same kind he had seen from in the Office. I wanted to tease the kid and snatched the paper from him - giving his head a little *tapli* in the back. I saw that it was a copy - of the Tribal Welfare Report, signed by Nattu Kaka and those Officers. The kid snatched it back and ran away. I didn’t go after him. Well it was his notebook - do what he may with it now.\n\n\n\nThe child went to the gravelled road, and walked for a few minutes with stern determination and a bold look. It began to drizzle lightly. The birds began to chirp, the animals made their sounds and evening came up - as if rehearsed by nature. Behind the setting sun, in the black clouds, the hill looked beautiful. A small streak of smoke emanated from a tiny orange flame on the hill. And on close inspection, the child saw the tribals dancing around the bonfire. Loud, powerful and angry - in rhythmic vibrations from the throat and mysterious dancing in a circle. \n\n\n\nThe child took out his pencil and wrote on the paper he had procured - in small letters next to the “ALL HEALTHY”, almost illegibly,  \n\n\n\n\\- “and all happy.” ', 'Aditya_Nirmale', 'prose', 'https://reddit.com/r/prose/comments/1ocrvof/to_see_the_dance/', 2, 0, '2025-10-22 05:00:02', '2025-11-07 23:40:41'),

Below are tips on how to survive the shutdown.\n\n\n\n**1. Understand What Happens in a Government Shutdown**\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the basics — what *actually* happens when the U.S. government “shuts down”?\n\n\n\nA shutdown isn’t like turning off the lights in Washington; it’s more like putting half the government on pause because Congress couldn’t agree on a spending plan. \n\n\n\nEach year, lawmakers have to pass funding bills to keep federal agencies running. When they don’t — boom — the money stops flowing, and most agencies have to close or scale way back until funding is restored.\n\n\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky: not everyone in the government goes home. Some employees are labeled “essential”, meaning their work is considered critical to public safety or national security — think air traffic controllers, border patrol, or the military. These people still have to show up to work, even though their paychecks might be delayed until the shutdown ends.\n\n\n\nEveryone else — often hundreds of thousands of people — is furloughed, which is basically unpaid leave. You’re told not to come in, not to check email, and to just wait. It’s stressful, especially when bills don’t stop just because the government did.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, everyday services that rely on federal funding start to feel the pinch.\n\n\n\n* National parks close or limit access.\n\n\n\n* Passport and visa processing slows to a crawl.\n\n\n\n* The IRS might delay refunds or freeze customer service lines.\n\n\n\n* Federal grant money, research programs, and small business loans all get stuck in limbo.\n\n\n\nSome programs, like Social Security, Medicare, and mail delivery, keep going — they’re funded differently and aren’t affected by these budget battles. But for a lot of people, especially federal workers and contractors, a shutdown means uncertainty, delayed income, and a lot of waiting.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line? A shutdown doesn’t mean the government disappears — it just goes into crisis mode. Knowing which services are affected (and which aren’t) helps you plan ahead and stay calm while the political storm passes.\n\n\n\n**2. Protect Your Finances**\n\n\n\nWhen a government shutdown hits, the first question most people ask is, *“How am I supposed to pay my bills?”*\n\n\n\nIt’s a fair question — and the good news is, there are smart ways to stay afloat while the paychecks are on pause.\n\n\n\nLet’s be honest: you can’t control when Congress decides to fund the government again, but you *can* control how you manage your money in the meantime. The goal is to stretch what you have, avoid unnecessary debt, and keep your essentials covered until things get back on track.\n\n\n\n**Start with a “bare-bones” budget**\n\n\n\nThis is your financial emergency mode. Focus on what truly matters: housing, food, utilities, transportation, and medication.  \nPress pause on non-essentials — dining out, new gadgets, subscriptions you barely use — anything that doesn’t help you get through the month. If it doesn’t feed you, shelter you, or keep the lights on, it can wait.\n\n\n\n**Talk to your lenders before things get tight**\n\n\n\nMany banks, credit unions, and credit card companies *expect* to hear from federal workers during shutdowns — and a lot of them actually offer special relief programs.\n\n  \nYou might be able to skip or delay payments, avoid late fees, or temporarily lower your interest rate. The key is to reach out early, before you miss a payment. It’s a lot easier to negotiate when you’re proactive.\n\n\n\n**Use your emergency fund strategically**\n\n\n\nIf you’ve built up an emergency fund — great job, this is exactly what it’s for.\n\nThat said, don’t drain it all at once. Use it for essentials only, and plan to rebuild it once back pay arrives (most shutdowns do include back pay for federal employees, though not always for contractors).\n\n\n\n**Avoid high-interest debt if possible**\n\n\n\nIt’s tempting to reach for the credit card or take out a quick loan to bridge the gap, but interest piles up fast. If you *must must borrow*, try to use lower-cost options — like a personal loan from your credit union or a 0% APR credit card — rather than payday or cash advance loans.\n\n\n\n**Check if you qualify for unemployment**\n\n\n\nIf you’re a furloughed contractor, you might actually qualify for unemployment benefits in your state. Federal employees typically don’t (because they’re expected to get back pay later), but contractors often can — and that can make a big difference in covering bills.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line: this is a time to be resourceful, not fearful. A shutdown is stressful, no doubt about it, but most people who plan ahead and communicate early with lenders make it through without major long-term damage.\n\n\n\nThink of it like financial triage — stabilize now, patch what you can, and rebuild when the checks start rolling again.\n\n\n\n**3. Manage Everyday Needs**\n\n\n\nWhen the government shuts down, life doesn’t stop — you still need to eat, pay bills, and take care of your family. This is where things can feel the most frustrating, especially if your paycheck is delayed. But with a little planning and some creative thinking, you can keep your essentials covered without panicking.\n\n\n\n**Let’s start with food.**\n\n\n\nIf you rely on SNAP benefits or other federal food assistance, you might still receive them for a short time even during a shutdown — but if the closure drags on, payments could get delayed.\n\n  \nThat doesn’t mean you need to fill your pantry like it’s the apocalypse, but it’s smart to stock up modestly on affordable staples — rice, beans, pasta, canned goods, frozen vegetables. The goal is to make your food stretch, not to clear out the grocery store.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t overlook local help. Food banks, churches, and community centers often expand their services during shutdowns, especially in areas with lots of federal workers. There’s no shame in accepting help when you need it — that’s what these programs are for.\n\n\n\n**Next up: healthcare.**\n\n\n\nThe good news is that most healthcare programs continue running even if the government isn’t fully funded.\n\n* Medicare and Medicaid keep operating.\n\n\n\n* VA hospitals and clinics stay open.\n\n\n\n* If your insurance comes through your federal job, your coverage should continue — but double-check to make sure your premiums are still being deducted properly once pay resumes.\n\n\n\nIf you need to fill prescriptions, try to get a 90-day supply of any essentials if possible, or ask your pharmacist if they can extend medication until your insurance payments catch up.\n\n\n\n**Don’t forget childcare.**\n\n\n\nThis one can sneak up on families. Some federally funded childcare programs — like Head Start centers — may have to close or cut hours during a shutdown. If you rely on one of those programs, it’s smart to have a backup plan in place, whether that’s a relative, a friend, or a local daycare that can temporarily step in.\n\n\n\nIf you’re part of a parenting or neighborhood group, this is also a great time to share resources — babysitting swaps, carpools, or meal exchanges can take a lot of pressure off everyone.\n\n\n\n**Other essentials**\n\n\n\nUtilities, phone bills, transportation — all the usual suspects still expect to be paid. This is where your “bare-bones” budget from Section 2 really helps. If you can, contact your utility providers to ask about hardship programs or flexible payment plans. Many of them quietly offer help during shutdowns; you just have to ask.\n\n\n\n**The bottom line?**\n\n  \nA government shutdown may cause chaos in D.C., but your daily life doesn’t have to unravel with it. Keep your focus on the basics — food, health, and family — and tap into local and community support when you need to. You’re not alone in this, and with a little planning, you can ride out the uncertainty without letting it take over your everyday life.\n\n\n\n**4. Plan for Service Delays**\n\n\n\nOne of the most annoying parts of a government shutdown isn’t always the missed paycheck — it’s the waiting. Things that normally move at a steady pace suddenly slow down or stop altogether. And while that’s frustrating, a little planning (and patience) can save you a lot of headaches.\n\n\n\nLet’s walk through what to expect.\n\n\n\nTaxes: same deadlines, slower everything\n\n\n\nYes, you still have to file your taxes during a shutdown — the IRS doesn’t take a vacation.\n\n  \nBut here’s the catch: refunds and customer service can be delayed if staff are furloughed. That means if you’re expecting money back, it might take longer to arrive.\n\n\n\nIf possible, file electronically — that usually helps speed things up a bit — and make sure all your documents are in order to avoid extra delays once things reopen.\n\n\n\n**Travel plans? Brace for bureaucracy.**\n\n\n\nIf you’re planning a trip abroad, get ready for some potential headaches.\n\n\n\nPassport and visa processing often slow to a crawl during a shutdown because the offices that handle them operate with reduced staff. Some locations might even close temporarily.\n\n\n\nIf your passport is about to expire or you need a new one, handle it early — don’t wait until the last minute. And if you’re already traveling soon, check the State Department’s website regularly for updates.\n\n\n\nTSA and air traffic controllers are considered essential, so airports stay open, but long lines and low morale can be part of the deal since many of those workers aren’t being paid during the shutdown.\n\n\n\n**Small business owners and researchers, take note**\n\n\n\nIf you depend on federal grants, SBA loans, or research funding, those programs typically freeze until the government reopens. Applications stop moving, approvals stall, and funding can’t be released.\n\n\n\nIf that’s you, now’s the time to pause big spending decisions and keep communication open with your contacts or program officers. Once funding resumes, there’s usually a big backlog — so be prepared for a slow restart.\n\n\n\nThe good news: some things keep running\n\nNot everything grinds to a halt. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid payments keep going out — those programs are funded separately.\n\n  \nSame with the U.S. Postal Service — your mail will still show up, even if it’s a few minutes late.\n\n\n\n**Bottom line**\n\n\n\nDuring a shutdown, patience becomes a survival skill. The best move is to get ahead of anything that involves the federal government — whether that’s renewing a passport, filing taxes, or applying for benefits.\n\n\n\nThink of it as weathering a storm: you can’t control when it passes, but you *can* make sure your house (and paperwork) are in order when the clouds clear.\n\n\n\n**5. Use Community Support**\n\n\n\nWhen the government shuts down, it’s easy to feel like you’re on your own — but you’re really not. Across the country, communities step up in big and small ways to help people get through the uncertainty. Whether it’s your local credit union offering payment relief or a neighbor dropping off groceries, there’s a surprising amount of support out there once you know where to look.\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about where to start.\n\n\n\nLean on local resources\n\n\n\nIf your paycheck’s on pause, don’t wait until things get desperate to ask for help. Many local organizations are ready for situations exactly like this.\n\n\n\n* Food banks, churches, and community centers often set up special distributions for federal workers and contractors.\n\n\n\n* Some local businesses and restaurants even offer free meals or discounts during shutdowns.\n\n\n\n* And credit unions (especially ones serving government employees) frequently offer short-term, low- or no-interest loans to help bridge the gap until back pay arrives.\n\n\n\nIt’s not charity — it’s community. You’ve spent years contributing taxes and public service; now it’s okay to let others lend a hand while things get sorted out.\n\n\n\n**Check for special programs**\n\n\n\nDuring longer shutdowns, many big organizations — from utility companies to mortgage lenders — roll out temporary assistance programs. These can include deferred payments, no late fees, or flexible payment plans.\n\n  \nIt’s worth a few phone calls or website visits to see what’s available. Often, they don’t advertise these programs loudly; you just have to ask.\n\n\n\nUnions and employee associations can be lifesavers\n\nIf you’re a member of a union or professional association, reach out to them early. They’re usually on top of the latest updates about relief funds, legal rights, and benefit options. Some even organize food drives or emergency grants specifically for members affected by shutdowns.\n\n\n\nEven if you’re not currently active in your union, now’s a great time to connect. They’ve helped people through this before — they’ll know what to do.\n\n\n\n**Neighbors helping neighbors**\n\n\n\nSometimes the most meaningful help doesn’t come from an organization at all. It’s a friend offering to watch your kids for a few hours. It’s a neighbor sharing extra groceries. It’s coworkers trading tips on which credit unions are being the most flexible.\n\n\n\nShutdowns are tough, but they also remind us that community still matters — that people look out for each other when things get hard.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to tough it out alone. Between local charities, financial institutions, unions, and the kindness of neighbors, there are plenty of safety nets to catch you while Washington sorts itself out.\n\n\n\nAsking for help isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom. The people around you *want* to help; sometimes they’re just waiting for you to reach out.\n\n\n\n**6. Take Care of Your Mental Health**\n\n\n\nLet’s be real — a government shutdown doesn’t just mess with your paycheck. It messes with your peace of mind. The uncertainty, the waiting, the constant news updates — it all takes a toll. You might feel frustrated, anxious, or even angry, and that’s completely normal.\n\n\n\nWhen your routine gets thrown off and money feels tight, stress can sneak up fast. So, just as you’re taking care of your finances and daily needs, it’s just as important to take care of *you.*\n\n\n\nAcknowledge what you’re feeling\n\n\n\nFirst things first: don’t beat yourself up for feeling stressed or upset. This situation is hard. Even people who seem calm on the outside are probably feeling it, too.\n\n  \nSometimes, just saying out loud, *“Yeah, this is really stressful,”* can be grounding. It gives you permission to deal with the emotions instead of pretending they’re not there.\n\n\n\nStick to a routine\n\nShutdowns can make your schedule feel out of control — especially if you’re furloughed and not working. Creating a daily routine helps bring back a sense of structure and normalcy.\n\n\n\n* Wake up and go to bed at consistent times.\n\n\n\n* Eat real meals (not just snacks and coffee).\n\n\n\n* Get outside or move your body every day, even if it’s just a walk around the block.\n\n\n\nIt sounds simple, but routine helps keep your brain from slipping into that “everything is chaos” mindset.\n\n\n\nStay connected\n\nIt’s tempting to isolate yourself when you’re stressed or embarrassed about money — but that only makes things harder.\n\n  \nReach out to coworkers, friends, or family members who get it. Many federal employees and contractors have been through shutdowns before, and they’ll understand exactly what you’re dealing with.\n\n\n\nSometimes just venting over coffee or swapping tips on how to stretch your budget can make you feel less alone.\n\n\n\nUse available support programs\n\nMost federal agencies have Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that offer free, confidential counseling. Even if you’re furloughed, you often still have access. If you’re not a federal worker, look for community counseling centers telehealth services that charge on a sliding scale.\n\nDon’t wait until you’re at a breaking point — talking to someone early can make a huge difference.\n\n\n\n**Limit the doom-scrolling**\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to get stuck refreshing news feeds, hoping for updates from Congress — but that constant drip of uncertainty only makes the anxiety worse.\n\n  \nTry setting boundaries: check the news once or twice a day, then step away. Replace that screen time with something that recharges you — a hobby, a workout, a good book, or just some quiet time.\n\n\n\nRemember, this will end\n\n\n\nEvery shutdown *does* end. It might not feel like it when you’re in the middle of it, but it always does. The paychecks return, the offices reopen, and life starts to feel normal again.\n\n\n\nUntil then, give yourself permission to slow down, ask for help, and take care of your mental well-being. You can’t control the politics — but you can protect your peace.\n\n\n\n**To advertise email us:**  \n[**bxadsvoice@gmail.com**](mailto:bxadsvoice@gmail.com)', 'NYCNewsNetwork', 'BronxNY', 'https://reddit.com/r/BronxNY/comments/1o91tj7/6_tips_on_how_to_survive_the_government_shutdown/', 1, 0, '2025-10-17 19:48:34', '2025-11-07 23:40:41'),

There’s no shame in accepting help when you need it — that’s what these programs are for.\n\n\n\nNext up: healthcare.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that most healthcare programs continue running even if the government isn’t fully funded.\n\n* Medicare and Medicaid keep operating.\n\n\n\n* VA hospitals and clinics stay open.\n\n\n\n* If your insurance comes through your federal job, your coverage should continue — but double-check to make sure your premiums are still being deducted properly once pay resumes.\n\n\n\nIf you need to fill prescriptions, try to get a 90-day supply of any essentials if possible, or ask your pharmacist if they can extend medication until your insurance payments catch up.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget childcare.\n\nThis one can sneak up on families. Some federally funded childcare programs — like Head Start centers — may have to close or cut hours during a shutdown. If you rely on one of those programs, it’s smart to have a backup plan in place, whether that’s a relative, a friend, or a local daycare that can temporarily step in.\n\n\n\nIf you’re part of a parenting or neighborhood group, this is also a great time to share resources — babysitting swaps, carpools, or meal exchanges can take a lot of pressure off everyone.\n\n\n\nOther essentials\n\nUtilities, phone bills, transportation — all the usual suspects still expect to be paid. This is where your “bare-bones” budget from Section 2 really helps. If you can, contact your utility providers to ask about hardship programs or flexible payment plans. Many of them quietly offer help during shutdowns; you just have to ask.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line?\n\n  \nA government shutdown may cause chaos in D.C., but your daily life doesn’t have to unravel with it. Keep your focus on the basics — food, health, and family — and tap into local and community support when you need to. You’re not alone in this, and with a little planning, you can ride out the uncertainty without letting it take over your everyday life.\n\n\n\n4. Plan for Service Delays\n\n\n\nOne of the most annoying parts of a government shutdown isn’t always the missed paycheck — it’s the waiting. Things that normally move at a steady pace suddenly slow down or stop altogether. And while that’s frustrating, a little planning (and patience) can save you a lot of headaches.\n\n\n\nLet’s walk through what to expect.\n\n\n\nTaxes: same deadlines, slower everything\n\n\n\nYes, you still have to file your taxes during a shutdown — the IRS doesn’t take a vacation.\n\n  \nBut here’s the catch: refunds and customer service can be delayed if staff are furloughed. That means if you’re expecting money back, it might take longer to arrive.\n\n\n\nIf possible, file electronically — that usually helps speed things up a bit — and make sure all your documents are in order to avoid extra delays once things reopen.\n\n\n\nTravel plans? Brace for bureaucracy.\n\nIf you’re planning a trip abroad, get ready for some potential headaches.\n\nPassport and visa processing often slow to a crawl during a shutdown because the offices that handle them operate with reduced staff. Some locations might even close temporarily.\n\n\n\nIf your passport is about to expire or you need a new one, handle it early — don’t wait until the last minute. And if you’re already traveling soon, check the State Department’s website regularly for updates.\n\n\n\nTSA and air traffic controllers are considered essential, so airports stay open, but long lines and low morale can be part of the deal since many of those workers aren’t being paid during the shutdown.\n\n\n\nSmall business owners and researchers, take note\n\n\n\nIf you depend on federal grants, SBA loans, or research funding, those programs typically freeze until the government reopens. Applications stop moving, approvals stall, and funding can’t be released.\n\n\n\nIf that’s you, now’s the time to pause big spending decisions and keep communication open with your contacts or program officers. Once funding resumes, there’s usually a big backlog — so be prepared for a slow restart.\n\n\n\nThe good news: some things keep running\n\nNot everything grinds to a halt. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid payments keep going out — those programs are funded separately.\n\n  \nSame with the U.S. Postal Service — your mail will still show up, even if it’s a few minutes late.\n\n\n\nBottom line\n\n\n\nDuring a shutdown, patience becomes a survival skill. The best move is to get ahead of anything that involves the federal government — whether that’s renewing a passport, filing taxes, or applying for benefits.\n\n\n\nThink of it as weathering a storm: you can’t control when it passes, but you *can* make sure your house (and paperwork) are in order when the clouds clear.\n\n\n\n5. Use Community Support\n\n\n\nWhen the government shuts down, it’s easy to feel like you’re on your own — but you’re really not. Across the country, communities step up in big and small ways to help people get through the uncertainty. Whether it’s your local credit union offering payment relief or a neighbor dropping off groceries, there’s a surprising amount of support out there once you know where to look.\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about where to start.\n\n\n\nLean on local resources\n\n\n\nIf your paycheck’s on pause, don’t wait until things get desperate to ask for help. Many local organizations are ready for situations exactly like this.\n\n\n\n* Food banks, churches, and community centers often set up special distributions for federal workers and contractors.\n\n\n\n* Some local businesses and restaurants even offer free meals or discounts during shutdowns.\n\n\n\n* And credit unions (especially ones serving government employees) frequently offer short-term, low- or no-interest loans to help bridge the gap until back pay arrives.\n\n\n\nIt’s not charity — it’s community. You’ve spent years contributing taxes and public service; now it’s okay to let others lend a hand while things get sorted out.\n\n\n\nCheck for special programs\n\n\n\nDuring longer shutdowns, many big organizations — from utility companies to mortgage lenders — roll out temporary assistance programs. These can include deferred payments, no late fees, or flexible payment plans.\n\n  \nIt’s worth a few phone calls or website visits to see what’s available. Often, they don’t advertise these programs loudly; you just have to ask.\n\n\n\nUnions and employee associations can be lifesavers\n\nIf you’re a member of a union or professional association, reach out to them early. They’re usually on top of the latest updates about relief funds, legal rights, and benefit options. Some even organize food drives or emergency grants specifically for members affected by shutdowns.\n\n\n\nEven if you’re not currently active in your union, now’s a great time to connect. They’ve helped people through this before — they’ll know what to do.\n\n\n\nNeighbors helping neighbors\n\nSometimes the most meaningful help doesn’t come from an organization at all. It’s a friend offering to watch your kids for a few hours. It’s a neighbor sharing extra groceries. It’s coworkers trading tips on which credit unions are being the most flexible.\n\n\n\nShutdowns are tough, but they also remind us that community still matters — that people look out for each other when things get hard.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to tough it out alone. Between local charities, financial institutions, unions, and the kindness of neighbors, there are plenty of safety nets to catch you while Washington sorts itself out.\n\n\n\nAsking for help isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom. The people around you *want* to help; sometimes they’re just waiting for you to reach out.\n\n\n\n6. Take Care of Your Mental Health\n\n\n\nLet’s be real — a government shutdown doesn’t just mess with your paycheck. It messes with your peace of mind. The uncertainty, the waiting, the constant news updates — it all takes a toll. You might feel frustrated, anxious, or even angry, and that’s completely normal.\n\n\n\nWhen your routine gets thrown off and money feels tight, stress can sneak up fast. So, just as you’re taking care of your finances and daily needs, it’s just as important to take care of *you.*\n\n\n\nAcknowledge what you’re feeling\n\n\n\nFirst things first: don’t beat yourself up for feeling stressed or upset. This situation is hard. Even people who seem calm on the outside are probably feeling it, too.\n\n  \nSometimes, just saying out loud, *“Yeah, this is really stressful,”* can be grounding. It gives you permission to deal with the emotions instead of pretending they’re not there.\n\n\n\nStick to a routine\n\nShutdowns can make your schedule feel out of control — especially if you’re furloughed and not working. Creating a daily routine helps bring back a sense of structure and normalcy.\n\n\n\n* Wake up and go to bed at consistent times.\n\n\n\n* Eat real meals (not just snacks and coffee).\n\n\n\n* Get outside or move your body every day, even if it’s just a walk around the block.\n\n\n\nIt sounds simple, but routine helps keep your brain from slipping into that “everything is chaos” mindset.\n\n\n\nStay connected\n\nIt’s tempting to isolate yourself when you’re stressed or embarrassed about money — but that only makes things harder.\n\n  \nReach out to coworkers, friends, or family members who get it. Many federal employees and contractors have been through shutdowns before, and they’ll understand exactly what you’re dealing with.\n\n\n\nSometimes just venting over coffee or swapping tips on how to stretch your budget can make you feel less alone.\n\n\n\nUse available support programs\n\nMost federal agencies have Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that offer free, confidential counseling. Even if you’re furloughed, you often still have access. If you’re not a federal worker, look for community counseling centers telehealth services that charge on a sliding scale.\n\nDon’t wait until you’re at a breaking point — talking to someone early can make a huge difference.\n\n\n\nLimit the doom-scrolling\n\nIt’s easy to get stuck refreshing news feeds, hoping for updates from Congress — but that constant drip of uncertainty only makes the anxiety worse.\n\n  \nTry setting boundaries: check the news once or twice a day, then step away. Replace that screen time with something that recharges you — a hobby, a workout, a good book, or just some quiet time.\n\n\n\nRemember, this will end\n\n\n\nEvery shutdown *does* end. It might not feel like it when you’re in the middle of it, but it always does. The paychecks return, the offices reopen, and life starts to feel normal again.\n\n\n\nUntil then, give yourself permission to slow down, ask for help, and take care of your mental well-being. You can’t control the politics — but you can protect your peace.\n\n', 'NYCNewsNetwork', 'NYCNewsToday', 'https://reddit.com/r/NYCNewsToday/comments/1o8fyw3/6_tips_on_how_to_survive_the_government_shutdown/', 1, 0, '2025-10-17 01:37:09', '2025-11-07 23:40:41');

Some interesting twists this season, some likeable teams and some competitive enough moments and teams…but still feels a bit hollow and boring compared to classic seasons.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTheme\n\n\\- This season is called “The Season of Surprises” which means there is 1 twist each leg - some of them are previous twists such as the Intersection and Head to Head, while some are new such as the Fork in the Road and Driver’s Seat. I mostly enjoyed the twists and this was a great theme! None of them ruined the episodes - they either added some intrigue like the U-Turn vote and Driver’s Seat (positive) or contributed nothing like the Valet Roulette or Fast Forward (didn’t add anything but weren’t negatives). 90 minute episodes can feel drawn out so adding a twist per episode was a great idea! I actually think this season was better because of these twists, and is a big reason I ranked it higher than TAR35 which was mostly uneventful.\n\n\\- But I’ll go through each twist individually. The Fork in the Road was fine - I would’ve preferred it for more than 1 challenge but I liked some of the strategy in choosing which path (pick the easier challenge, the route with less teams so far, or the route with weaker teams?). The Intersection was also fine - I would’ve preferred it later in the race though (in leg 2 we don’t really care that Scott and Bernie or Jeff and Courtney are working together - in a later episode it would feel more impactful to see different teams working together). The Express Pass challenges are good - I would like the element of giving away Express Passes brought back somehow too. The Driver’s Seat is fantastic and I’d like to see it introduced permanently and preferably 2 per season. The U-Turn vote (and it being live) and traditional U-Turns are great (love the drama). Fast Forwards are good although not implemented well here - they need to either be a difficult challenge (eg. head shave, eating, heights) or an opportunity for a 1 vs 1 (like TAR25’s surfing) and it was basically guaranteed whichever team found the sports car first gets it without opposition. The Head to Head was fine and much better than having it directly before the pit stop. The Scramble is okay in the finale but didn’t work because every team did the challenges in the same order (but it doesn’t hurt the episode). The Valet Roulette was the most pointless but isn’t a negative. And finally the non-elimination was a bit of a letdown being used as one of the twists - I would’ve liked bringing back losing your possessions (not money though because begging is a bit icky nowadays) or a Speed Bump.  \n\n\\- If I were to add in some more twists, I would have included a Yield. Maybe teams have to find an hourglass (a 10 minute or a 20 minute like TAR32). I honestly wouldn’t be opposed to a Yield every leg like TAR32. And instead of 2 Express Passes, I think they could have brought back The Save for 1 of them (complete an extra challenge to win The Save). The Save could either create the non-elimination or create the first ever final 2 (if not used). I also think maybe reworking The Hazard - rather than just being 1 additional challenge for failing something, make it a penalty like Amazing Race Australia (can’t speak for the leg, have to carry something for the leg, can’t ask for directions, lose possessions etc). And moving forward I think a twist each leg should become the norm. I don’t even mind if they have 2 twists in 1 leg (for example a Head to Head and an Express Pass challenge can be in the same leg). I think they could have even more twists with 90 minute episodes - 2 Driver’s Seats per season, 2 Intersections/Fast Forwards/Head to Heads per season, 1 U-Turn vote plus 2 traditional U-Turns, etc. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGeneral Thoughts\n\n\\- I still found this season dull compared to many classic seasons! More “good episodes” than TAR33-TAR36 although also many boring ones. 90 minute episodes again which can also drag when casts aren’t that interesting. And unfortunately I have to say this is one of the dullest casts ever, down there with TAR34 and TAR35. Jonathan/Ana’s rocky relationship provided some interesting old school negativity and the season would have felt very hollow without them. The final 3 weren’t too boring (the other teams in the final 6 were duller) which helped and there were a lot of likeable teams overall. They also felt less gimmicky and easier to support - no celebrities, nobody who danced with Pitbull, no teams with inspirational backstories, and less teams defined just by their profession (I guess maybe Mark/Brett being Vegas Performers or Pops/Jeff being Lumberjacks but a lot of teams were just regular friends or siblings which was refreshing). A few older contestants and less younger couples was nice (although many of the older teams went early). It’s also the largest cast ever at 14 teams and the first few episodes don’t work as well with so many teams to follow.\n\n\\- There’s still a lack of inter-teams dynamics which is common in the new era. A lot of robotic challenge scenes with teams just “doing the challenge” with no storylines or substance (and airport scenes were weak - teams were just directed to a travel agent. One team even went to the wrong travel agent so that proves they don’t really have freedom with flights). The U-Turn vote brought some intriguing drama but no ongoing storylines. One example is Jonathan/Ana feeling betrayed by Carson/Jack with their U-Turn vote…but that’s never mentioned again despite both teams making the final 3. Pops/Jeff and Melinda/Erika also make a parents alliance which seemed endearing but also didn’t lead anywhere. I just wish they would stop the robotic racing and have a few confessionals where teams are commenting on one another or show teams socialising or gossiping at airports. The only interesting dynamic was Ana dealing with Jonathan’s rudeness and mood swings. Maybe a bit more friction than some of the Covid seasons with teams like Han/Holden, Nick/Mike and Bernie/Carrigain showing some minor bickering.\n\n\\- One thing that stood out this season was the effort in showing off the locations and experiences positively. A lot of things were hyped up by Phil and the contestants “OMG the Japanese drumming was so great, OMG the bullet train was so great”, “OMG the ATV in Bali was so great”, “OMG the camels and bedouins were so great”, “OMG the medieval archery was so great” and even things like “OMG first time in Naples” and “OMG a self drive” and “OMG that ritual was so great” (even when the ritual just looked “okay”, no offence haha). This has been a thing in the last few seasons, with the Expedia experiences, but felt more obvious this season. It’s not a bad thing but I secretly miss the days when a team called Stonehenge “just a pile of rocks”, or were underwhelmed with the Berlin Wall, or even complained about poverty or being scammed (the negative sides of travel are basically non-existent now). It’s nice seeing teams enjoying the race, but I also like gritty and realistic travel experiences.\n\n\\- Carson/Jack were likeable and deserving winners…although felt like they had the same edit as the last few winners (Kim/Penn, Derek/Claire, Greg/John, Ricky/Cesar). No negative qualities, competent racers, respectful, a little dorky at times etc. I feel like Carson/Jack were more interesting than Greg/John and Ricky/Cesar, and didn’t dominate as much (their win wasn’t as predictable but still felt a bit predictable based on the edits). Overall they were probably the best outcome but a Han/Holden underdog win would have been a unique ending (or a team like Melinda/Erika somehow getting to the end and pulling off a win). It was a satisfying ending but felt a bit standard.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nRoute   \n\n\\- The route was okay but still bottom half compared to previous seasons because it only had Asia and Europe. Very visually appealing route, a new country in Bulgaria (1 new country 37 seasons in is fine), but a lot of the legs feel like “been there done that” - Dubai, Hong Kong and Bali are overused, and even the less visited regions in Osaka, Kyoto, Naples, Strasbourg and Porto feel generic although mostly nice places. China and Japan feel similar as well as most of the European legs feel similar. Dubai is one of the most overused cities but still good to visit the Middle East. The Los Angeles start was generic (if they start in Los Angeles I feel like it needs to be an iconic Hollywood sign type start) but Miami felt diverse as the Miami Beach area hasn’t been utilised in previous Miami visits. But feels like a good route if you haven’t seen the first 30 seasons.\n\n\\- The 90 minute episodes meant challenges got more airtime so it was more important to make them diverse and interesting again. Unfortunately they weren’t again haha Most of them were challenging enough (more complex than many earlier seasons) but felt boring to watch. Things like the Japanese drumming, the dance challenges and fixing the sumo costume were “difficult” but they felt so long and repetitive - we saw so many attempts, some struggles, some passing, repeat, repeat, repeat. There were some exciting placement shifts but teams were mostly dull so it didn’t feel captivating to watch EVERY SINGLE team’s failed attempts. With a more interesting cast, the challenges would have looked better though. Charla/Mirna made some very terrible challenges interesting, for example Charla/Mirna climbing a bamboo tower was better than any TAR37 team climbing the bun tower, and Charla in armor is better than Carson/Jack geeking out in the armor.\n\n\\- A lot of challenges also felt very boring and were just making/doing something (although once again Charla/Mirna making noodles was hilarious while that challenge would have been dead boring with this cast) - we had delivering heavy things that “weren’t heavy enough to cause serious drama”, making things like origami cranes and stork nests were difficult but still teams were mostly boring, putting things in the correct places like the fruits and the coral is also boring, making food items like pizzas and mozzarella, threshing rice, milking sheep, washing laundry, and these all just feel so boring. The only ones that stood out were the hay because of Nick/Mike, deciphering the bible verse in the library (there were actually 2 challenges in bookstores in Bulgaria though), and maybe the water jousting felt a bit different. There were 3 surfing type challenges and 2 weapons challenges (with the ninja weapons being very difficult and arguably unfair).\n\n\\- I’ve already mentioned all the twists earlier because they were the theme of the season. They either made the episode more interesting or were “better than nothing”. None of them ruined the episodes. We still technically have never had a season with truly “no non-eliminations” because they add in 1 Keep on Racing, megaleg or “a surprise non-elimination”. I personally prefer 11 teams with 3 non-eliminations (larger casts feel more cluttered plus a team doesn’t feel completely “doomed” when it’s definitely elimination) but if they have a larger cast, they should try sticking fully to no non-eliminations…because it’s just unnecessarily annoying each season haha\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCast Ranking\n\n1.Jonathan/Ana - I love complexity and these 2 got fans talking the most! They had previously separated but said that watching The Amazing Race helped them get back together. Bickering couples over “boring and positive” any day! Jonathan was occasionally moody, sarcastic, overly competitive (frustrated with 2nd place one leg), rudely blamed Ana in challenges, and once called her a terrible partner. Ana was super sweet and took this abuse, for example supporting Jonathan through his heat exhaustion despite him being tough on her. But their edit was a bit all over the place - Jonathan was actually supportive a lot of the time (like when Ana struggled in the finale - possibly redemption ending for Jonathan) and Ana called Jonathan the perfect partner during her ectopic pregnancy. Jonathan got a lot of hate from fans but he wasn’t as abusive as some of the classic teams (for example original TAR6 Jonathan). They were the arrogant threatening team at the start and a target for the U-Turn, then a bit more dysfunctional later on. But most intriguing!\n\n2. Carson/Jack - more likeable, maybe even funnier than Jonathan/Ana, but “the gamers” were more 1 dimensional. But still brought some fun energy! They were classic nerds and compared A LOT of things to their video games and nerd stereotypes, “I used to pick the flowers instead of playing soccer” and “I read an origami book at the library instead of hanging out with jocks”, and when they separated from Han/Holden they compared it to Lord of the Rings “goodbye fellowship” haha. Some of it felt forced (comparing the ATV course to Mariokart was a bit cringe haha), but I still can’t help but like them. They were fans, Jack was unemployed, some strategy and talking about minimising their threat level, an impressive comeback when falling 3 hours behind and a sense of humor (when Jack was closeted he met Carson who was dancing to Lady Gaga…and only a gay person would know that choreography haha). Good racers, their “pool noodle arms” still got them through physical challenges and always respectful.\n\n3. Han/Holden - they weren’t the biggest characters ever but I really enjoyed watching them. They were likeable, a few bickering moments (that didn’t feel mean spirited), and were somewhat underdogs with a few blunders compared to the other teams at the end. A few fun moments like talking about their parents being immigrants at the rice threshing, “they worked to get us an education so we didn’t have to be rice farmers” haha, Han catching a cheeky wave on the surfboard task, “That’s my girl…and by that I mean my sister” and crushing on the chef in Dubai “I already have a boyfriend” haha They hadn’t worked together much previously, were racing for their sister with cerebral palsy and seemed fun and down to Earth (often joking with one another such as Holden joking about plagiarising Han’s work). \n\n4. Nick/Mike - I generally don’t like the young alpha male teams…but these 2 were a pleasant exception. They DID NOT dominate in a boring fashion - in fact they failed many challenges, got lost a bit and argued multiple times. They actually became an underdog team who just scraped through several times and were lucky to even make the final 7. But they were also very likeable. They had applied multiple times, were superfans and felt relatable and down to Earth. Joked around like “I touched Mike in places” when putting on the sumo outfit, “unfortunately the only time we spent in the kitchen with nonna and mom was eating and not cooking” during the food prep challenge, and Nick wearing “cool glasses” for his eye injury. They somewhat re-enacted the famous 8 hour hay bails challenge. With Carson/Jack’s miraculous come from behind, could this have been even more interesting than Lena’s failure? But I really enjoyed watching these 2.\n\n5. Scott/Lori - great early boots and a shock early elimination! Feels more interesting than the standard weaker teams leaving early (which is most early boots this season). They were very fun, enthusiastic, a strong older couple, fun comments like their “slogging” which means slow jogging, and cute moments like Lori “Oh shoot he’s got the clue” but quickly changing demeanour to “but good for him” haha Scott was a bit of a show off but still endearing. They were bitter over the U-Turn “It’s like our 8 sons voted against us” and had the “we aren’t threats, we’re old and weak” mentality (hints of Dave/Connor who were coincidently also mormons) but Scott/Lori didn’t get into the annoying territory (yet). They were similar to Jocelyn/Victor - a fun and likeable older couple who sadly left too early.\n\n6. Pops/Jeff - a very likeable and sugary sweet father/son dynamic similar to Rob/Corey. Not that interesting but you can’t help but find their bond endearing. You could tell how much Jeff admired his father, loved spending time together growing up as lumberjacks, and “When he was born I knew he’d be my friend”. Pops did very well physically (climbed the bun tower without using his legs) and Phil was crushing on Pops a few times “I want to look like that at 64” and “Pop’s arms looking great coming up there” haha. Jeff, “I’ve always called him Superman and I got to see him fly today” aww and losing out in a footrace was a sad ending for them.\n\n7. Melinda/Erika - similar to Pops/Jeff but maybe not as “sugary sweet”. I usually like the older or underdog type teams but these 2 didn’t stand out much for me, outside a few small disagreements and mistakes…although I did still like them. They did have classic Nancy/Emily vibes as they came across as just a regular down to earth mother/daughter team who just scraped by each week. I just unfortunately didn’t find them that interesting sorry. Their biggest moment was misinterpreting you “must not take taxis” to “you must take taxis”. Erika saying they’re good at reading clues right after taking a taxi haha\n\n8. Alyssa/Josiah - and another likeable team (who weren’t that interesting) but I find parent/child teams more endearing than a nice couple. They seemed so sweet and perfect so you can’t hate them…but sweet couples aren’t one of my favorite archetypes unless you’re super funny or interesting. There was just no depth or storylines from them at all. Josiah had an occasional fun moment (some pizza puns with Phil) but nothing special. He also seemed to have very over the top enthusiasm for everything and a permanent smile (normal things like the Bedouin drums were the best thing ever for him haha). Nice but not my sort of team. I did like the contrast between Alyssa/Josiah being very positive and Jonathan/Ana being very negative in the final 4. \n\n9. Bernie/Carrigain - “were like a married couple that should be divorced” and had a few arguments and filled the role of the dysfunctional girl team (similar to Morgan/Lena, Kishori/Karishma, Michelle/Victoria etc) and I like that archetype. They had the biggest fight of the season at the airport but weren’t too explosive overall. They were fine but not super memorable. Would definitely rank higher if they lasted longer and if we saw more craziness or bickering from them.\n\n10. Mark/Larry - I like the unique older teams and believe there should be more of them (2 less-fit older men aren’t that common). These 2 also would have been great if they lasted longer - “broke rednecks” who had never been outside the US and you could tell they had a good sense of humor joking about the name being “Handsome Stranger” and making fun of each other for crying. Similar to Tim/Rex or Steve/Dave (fun in their short time) or could have been a fun and relatable Bopper/Mark type team if they lasted longer. Could they have survived if it wasn’t a Fork in the Road as they were ahead of teams from the other side? Or if it weren’t a double elimination, could we have had them for longer in the race?\n\n11. Jackye/Lauren - and similar to Mark/Larry but here we have 2 older women who aren’t likely to do well but will be entertaining in their short stay. Once again I like the unique older teams even if they’re a disaster. These 2 fell behind quickly in their 1 leg. Jackye had a fear of stairs after a previous injury and had an inspirational moment when the show’s first challenge was of course stairs haha Then Lauren struggled at the bun climbing and then succeeded with inspirational music. I got the impression that their “inspirational” moments were more played as a joke because their effort felt more “pathetic” than inspirational sorry haha But still enjoyed watching them - being similar to the Gutsy Grannies is a good thing!\n\n12. Brett/Mark - felt underedited and the most irrelevant team in the final 5. Similar to Quinton/Mattie and Yvonne/Melissa in that they make it far but are very boring and we know very little about them. Their only interesting moment was confusing the Burj Khalifa with Wiz Khalifa haha They seemed nice, okay racers, but I found them very boring and forgettable, plus I’m not a fan of boring fit males.\n\n13. Courtney/Jasmin - an early boot team who were mostly behind but not really in an interesting way. They struggled to get taxis a few times, and at first it appeared that the taxis didn’t stop because they were black but it was mostly because they didn’t show the drivers the Chinese parts of the clue. But Courtney had trouble kicking in the Japanese game (with an emotional scene talking about her mother), struggled at the origami, “In the hospital someone would be dead right now” haha but were mostly just nice, not great racers and forgettable - mostly just remembered for being “the nurses”. \n\n14. Ernest/Bridget - didn’t make much of an impression. Seemed nice but only remembered for Ernest struggling at the drumming Intersection which slowed Mark down. They didn’t entertainingly struggle (like Chris/Mary or Elizabeth/Iliana) and we already had nice parent/child teams in Pops/Jeff and Erika/Melinda. They hinted at Ernest being more authoritarian previously so maybe potential for a Ron/Christina dynamic…but didn’t get anything interesting from them here.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeg Rankings\n\n1.Leg 7 - Bulgaria (F7 - Nick/Mike eliminated) - a fantastic episode and possibly the best episode of the 30s…maybe not of all time though because this is a boring cast haha. But it had the first self drive (sad that it’s hyped up) with some classic navigation dramas. The big one was Carson/Jack falling 3 hours behind…and wildly managing to catch up! (one of the best comebacks). Loved Melinda/Erika racing Nick/Mike to the U-Turn (and it appeared they put the pictures in the wrong order haha) and obviously Nick/Mike really struggling with the hay. But also had Jonathan blaming Ana for choosing the hay but then getting stuck in a ditch (Jonathan’s fault), a new country in Bulgaria (Josiah confusing Sofia, Bulgaria with Sofia Vergara haha), all teams far apart (felt old school), and the ritual being like “where the wild things are”. Milking the sheep had the 102 year old lady, Mark being strangely scared of milking, and Holden “I didn’t know where the squirt hole was coming from” with milk going everywhere haha Just a fun episode the whole way through!\n\n2. Leg 4 - Indonesia (F10 - Bernie/Carrigain eliminated) - this leg had more moments where teams weren’t just robotically doing challenges. 1 of only 2 minor flight scrambles, the Driver’s Seat had Jonathan/Ana making some questionable decisions (alienating Scott/Lori, giving Carson/Jack less weight, giving Bernie/Carrigain more weight, using the Express Pass straight after), some bitterness and discussion on who are threats, Brett/Mark coming from behind and some arguing from Bernie/Carrigain. The ATV course was okay but basically an ad with some cringy and forced confessionals like Jonathan comparing it to Indiana Jones and Carson/Jack “reliving our Mariokart fantasy”. The rice threshing was good because of the Driver’s Seat (and 49 year old Lori dominating), and both of the Detours were just “making things” but had fun moments - Jonathan wanting to go to the bathroom, funny stories to remember the fruits, Nick/Mike spilling the offering onto the judge haha, the Balinese village looked nice, and a group of teams running around looking for the pit stop. Would have been even better if Bernie/Carrigain were with them too.\n\n3. Leg 5 - Indonesia (F9 - Scott/Lori eliminated) - I loved the U-Turn vote! I’ll always be a fan of drama - Scott/Lori feeling bitter “They’re not my friends anymore” and even small ones like Jonathan/Ana feeling betrayed by Carson/Jack, and Carson/Jack commenting on their social game. Also the strategies (splitting votes, targeting threats etc). However the tasks were simple (delivering coconuts, attaching coral, finding the correct surfboard) so the U-Turned teams felt screwed, and also whoever had the Driver’s Seat in the previous leg was likely to be U-Turned here. Jonathan was a hilarious wet blanket for most of the leg - Ana tried supporting him but he snapped “Be quiet I have a headache”. Very close with Jonathan and Scott together at the surfboards with Jonathan half passed out on the board haha Carson/Jack and Mark/Brett were close for 1st “a little gay beach hanging out” haha And Lori/Scott were an interesting shock elimination. Might rank higher if there were more moments from the non U-Turned teams.\n\n4. Leg 8 - Bulgaria (F6 - Melinda/Erika eliminated) - another Carson/Jack comeback…no equalisers with a few placement shifts made the leg feel dynamic (but not as interesting as the first Bulgaria leg). Loved translating the bible verse with teams needing to turn the cypher over - Alyssa/Josiah hilariously searching the library and even climbed the ladder, Han/Holden argued over breathing haha, and some great inter-team dynamics (Jonathan helping Alyssa/Josiah, Han/Holden working with Melinda/Erika but then working with Carson/Jack when Melinda/Erika walked away, and Holden deciding to help Melinda/Erika which could have been a mistake). Finding the Klerk shop had some fun moments, some public transport navigation (Carson/Jack randomly meeting a former cluegiver on the bus haha). Finding the crucifix in the lake was very boring, and the hot coals Speed Bump was okay (Josiah hating hot things was a bit weird). Felt tense at the dance, despite knowing that Melinda/Erika were about to get a few penalties for taking taxis. \n\n5. Leg 10 - France (F5 - Brett/Mark eliminated) - a notch down from the first 4 legs which were all “very good”. Not a lot happening, mostly boring tasks, but some exciting placement shifts and many small tasks. A quick visit to Germany, probably so it could be included on the Council of Europe question (Jonathan was like “we raced in Germany?”). Jonathan was in a sour mood the entire leg (I like some negativity) - blaming Ana for the cheese and calling her a “terrible partner”. Some arguing from Han/Holden, some stress with Alyssa/Josiah deciding whether to use the Express Pass at the cheese guessing (probably waited too long to use it), the jousting Head to Head was okay, washing laundry/making the stork nest were boring but some okay moments (Carson/Jack wondering what the old ladies were gossiping about “they’re calling us handsome” haha and it was tense with Alyssa/Josiah and/Brett/Mark’s nests getting rejected and working out why). Some navigation dramas throughout and felt interesting enough despite no big moments\n\n6. Leg 12 - USA (F4 - Alyssa/Josiah eliminated and F3 - Finale) - a generally underwhelming finale! An okay first half but Carson/Jack took the lead and seemed unbeatable during the final challenge (the best finales are when teams are equal at a tough memory challenge). Alyssa/Josiah’s elimination added some excitement (maybe a strategy to make the finale better). The water challenges showed off Miami well - speedboat across Biscayne Bay, rescuing the mannequin, sailing the dinghy (which turned into teams just paddling it “the nerdiest and least cool way possible”) and the flyboard, which was the only interesting challenge (although very similar to Dubai’s electronic surfboard). The flyboard had all 3 teams together, Ana facing her fear of water (with Jonathan actually being supportive), and Jack the nerd beating Han the surfer. The final challenge wasn’t great, Carson/Jack seemed unbeatable, and Han/Holden’s accident actually put them further behind. A satisfying result, well done for filming through a flood, but pretty average!\n\n7. Leg 11 - Portugal (F4 - TBC) - feels similar to the finale (90 minutes of dull teams) but without the excitement of…the finale. It ends with a cliffhanger of Jonathan/Ana and Alyssa/Josiah at the final challenge together…with Jonathan breaking a tile. It’s fine as long as they don’t do it every season. There was also another minor cliffhanger before a commercial where Alyssa/Josiah have a car rear-end them…but nothing happens (similar to the tile cliffhanger haha). Valet Roulette is pointless, the paddle and delivering barrels was dull (some unusual bickering with Alyssa/Josiah though), the bow and arrow was dull (Carson/Jack geek out over the medieval task and Han calls Holden “Tyrion Lannister” in the armor haha “short king!”) And the tiles were okay because teams were close together from the trains. Jonathan had another negative leg and overreacted when Ana walked in front of him “Don’t cut me off, that’s rude” - they fell behind early and Jonathan was sarcastic and critical again. Felt tense at times but 90 minutes is too much for a final 4 leg.\n\n8. Leg 1 - China (F14 - Jackye/Lauren and Mark/Larry eliminated) - not that great of a premiere honestly! I did like classic elements like driving to the airport for 1 of 2 flights, the ferries (even though the equaliser felt annoying), the double elimination, the Tian Tan Buddha (Jackye facing her fear of stairs), plus premieres don’t feel as drawn out at 90 minutes. But not much interesting from the teams though - Jonathan/Ana were shown as super competitive, took an early lead and Jonathan was frustrated by the equaliser and not coming 1st. Not many other teams stood out (maybe a bit of struggle from Nick/Mike and Jackye/Lauren). Climbing the bun tower was too easy with only Lauren slightly struggling (without the rain it would have been even easier), and the lion dance/Cantonese opera both felt similar and were just a montage of teams performing, failing and sometimes succeeding. Thankfully we had the Fork in the Road or they’d be very little suspense with Jackye/Lauren falling far behind - it was actually a very close finish with Mark/Larry!\n\n9. Leg 6 - United Arab Emirates (F8 - Pops/Jeff eliminated) - mostly boring besides a fantastic ending with the close train and foot race between Pops/Jeff and Nick/Mike (with the train in front closing on Pops/Jeff). Every challenge seemed to be designed to show off Dubai rather than be interesting - riding camels was boring (of course Carson/Jack compare it to Star Wars), skydiving was boring and making the tea platter was boring (Han crushing on chef Christoffe and Holden was expecting some “super old head instead of this good looking French guy” haha). The electric surfboard was okay because many teams were there at once. Holden was a mess from saying “that’s my girl…and by that I mean my sister” to awkwardly saying “You’re in a good spot” to Nick/Mike but “No we’re tied for last”. Holden then awkwardly replied “oh…well good luck” haha Very disappointed with the Fast Forward feeling like a long commercial in the deep diving pool - the first to find the car was basically guaranteed the Fast Forward (liked Phil trying it though).\n\n10. Leg 9 - Italy (F5 - Non elimination) - this leg was pretty boring and mostly challenge-oriented. Carson/Jack mentioned having a fight the last time they went to Italy and this time “we don’t need nonnas saying shut up Americans from their windows” haha Making the mandolin/braiding mozzarella were just “generic making things” (only moment was Han/Holden thinking their mozzarellas were terrible but surprisingly getting some approved “We’re not even bad bro”), purchasing groceries in Italian also felt generic, and making the pizza was about as generic as an Italian challenge as you could get (they say “from scratch” but not really). Carson was calling himself “America’s worst cook”, Ana worked at Dominoes, the judge was scared when Alyssa put her hand in the oven, and some fun banter with the non-participants eating the failed attempts. Also a funny moment where Phil and Josiah were trying to outdo one another with pizza puns and ending with “those jokes are cheesy” haha Boring but more tasks than the ones below it.\n\n11. Leg 2 - Japan (F12 - Ernest/Bridget eliminated) - very disappointed in the 2 Japan episodes which is a shame since I love visiting Japan and Japanese culture. Both very drawn out, boring and not much interesting happened - both legs needed 1 more challenge. This one is slightly ahead because the airport scramble was okay with different flights and Bernie/Carrigan’s big argument (the only heated argument of the season). Also some placement shifts at the challenges, some stress from Han/Holden, and Ernest letting Mark down at the Intersection. But the drumming was very long and boring - it was just bang, bang, bang with sometimes passing and sometimes failing (but no interesting moments). Jack, “I imagine it to be what Scott/Lori’s home sounds like” haha Making the Mochi balls/wrapping the sumo outfit were also boring with teams just robotically doing them for a good chunk of the 90 minutes. The sumo judge was okay but it seemed pointless to push them out of the ring because it’s almost impossible to move them (from experience).\n\n12. Leg 3 - Japan (F11 - Courtney/Jasmin eliminated) - and also felt long and boring with not much happening! The fortune paper was boring (besides Courtney/Jasmin having to wet theirs again and the bus driving off), the Japanese hackysack was boring besides a few struggles (in particular Carrigan and Courtney), and Jonathan being unsupportive “I’m not going to smile when you’re having a hard time doing something so simple”, the Express Pass just being both completing the Road Block was a bit lame, and the Detour felt poorly designed - it felt unsatisfying because it came down to how quickly the teams quit the ninja weapons for the much easier origami. A bit of stress from teams at both Detours, Alyssa was surprisingly stressed, plus a scene of Nick/Mike meditating and talking about having his jaw shut for 3 months, plus helping Han/Holden. It also felt a bit silly having Ana talking about her daughter being proud of them doing origami…when they actually picked the other Detour first haha But mostly very boring!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSummary\n\nAnother dull, mostly positive post-Covid season with many drawn out 90 minute episodes…but a satisfying ending with an okay final 3, likeable teams and a twist every leg made the season “okay” - the twists and some slight drama/negativity puts it a step above TAR35 which also had no big moments and had one of the dullest casts. It was more satisfying than TAR32 and TAR16 (also dull casts that I gave a 5) but just behind TAR19 (a similar positive cast but slightly more interesting and less long challenge scenes). I’m more negative on this season than most fans, probably because I prefer drama. I confidently place TAR8 and TAR24 (unpopular seasons) above TAR35 because they were more entertaining.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo after each season I will place it on a ranking:\n\n1.TAR5 - 10/10\n\n2. TAR3 - 10/10\n\n3. TAR12 - 9/10\n\n4. TAR17 - 9/10\n\n5. TAR25 - 9/10\n\n6. TAR31 - 9/10\n\n7. TAR18 - 9/10\n\n8. TAR2 - 8/10\n\n9. TAR7 - 8/10\n\n10. TAR29 - 8/10\n\n11. TAR20 - 8/10\n\n12.

(57, 'reddit', '1o2iwau', 'I ran away from home when I was 20', 'I (28 F) was given to my grandmother from my mother side by my mother to be raised since I was 3. My mother divorced my father when I was 7 since she found out he cheated on her. My dad was never around since after marriage he was left with a lot of debts and had to go work abroad. My mother remarried my dad’s alcoholic closest friend a few months after they divorced. \nAs a child I rarely saw my parents. My mother was coming maybe once a week to visit me for an hour or 2 since she was  “too busy with work”. She then had my baby sister when I was 9 and left her in care of the other grandmother from her husband’s side. I rarely seen my sister and for a good while I couldn’t even see my mother because her alcoholic husband was aggressive and I was too scared of him when he was drunk. \nI fell under bad depression during my teenage years and refused to get out of the house for a whole year. Somehow that time my dad came after not seeing him for years and took away my only joy the computer that I shut myself in to playing games. At that time I didn’t knew what to feel, joy for seeing him after so many years or sadness because the only thing that kept my happiness was gone. I cried and I shut myself more and all I did was watch videos on YouTube on my phone of things I knew I could never have since my family “was poor”. \nI don’t remember what happened but somehow I pulled myself back together and managed to graduate high school and get in a university to study psychology which I really enjoyed for about half a year. After a few months some teachers got ill and they cancelled some classes. As I had very poor social skills I decided go back home retreat again in to my gaming world. (My mom with financial help from my grandma they managed to buy from scrape warehouse a computer so I can use it for assignments and such.) Then same thing happened again where teachers didn’t show up for the classes so all of us left. (We were not given many details “as kids”) My grandma notice I came home earlier then I should a couple of times and so she called my mom to tell her: “She started skipping her classes again! I don’t know what to do with her anymore.” My mother came urgently before work and she said I was lying that professors didn’t show up and she said “I better have never gave birth to you.” That moment felt like a relieve, she finally showed her true face that she was trying to hide for many years. I was told in the past many times by her when I was just a baby “you are just like your dad” and I never understood what she meant by that. At that point I thought I need to leave this place ASAP. I told a friend from high school who I keep contact with what happened and he decided to help me with job and a place to stay. But that was over the sea in a different country. \nI took that chance and left. My controlling parents who never let me out after it got dark even after I was 18 and made me lose all my friends couldn’t believe it. But I did it, I packed a suitcase with basic needs and left. My mother who was always against me getting a job in the past decided to come with me at the airport and gave me 100€ before I left. I took that money and never looked back.\nYou would think I would have ended contact with them but I didn’t. At begin I spoke with my mother once every few months sometimes maybe once a year just telling her what I was up to. I didn’t wanted to keep grudges I felt like those would only drag me down. All it mattered it was that I could make it live on my own and support myself.\nThe guy that helped me we became partners for a few months but then he was living with his parents and his friends in same house which they didn’t like me too much since I tend to be very quiet and shy most of the time. A lot of the things that went wrong in that house I was blamed for, so I left after I got my first bigger wage. I spent all my money on rent and for a whole week I had to eat plain rice since I couldn’t afford anything. \nI started getting more money, so much money I’ve never had in my entire life. I was able to pay the bills, buy any food I wanted, got myself a smart tablet with the lowest minimum wage job I could find. I don’t want to give too many details of what was my first work to not be discovered, but it wasn’t a “body revealing” job that some females (and males) decide to go for these days, but one that paid taxes and involved a lot of physical work.\nAfter a few years of breaking my back bewitched by money I realised I couldn’t do it physically anymore. So I enrolled to college in my current country and studied again to prove my knowledge since all diplomas were from another country and they didn’t help much. Working full time night shifts 12h shifts sleeping for 1-2h then going to college I managed to get my basic high school diplomas again. I’ve done foundation year at university then changed course a little bit to one that could be accessible either that way or with really high grades (which I could hit them since I was struggling with work, sleep and personal relationships and funeral of my grandmother due to Covid).\nI am currently in 1st year at university studying something else than psychology, which don’t get me wrong I love both subjects but I decided to go to a different path more practical. \nA few months a go I was diagnosed with ADHD and so that explained why all my life was a struggle to pay attention in classes and struggled with things that everyone got it easy.\nMy mother finally realised a year ago that the alcoholic husband doesn’t love her neither his own child and she divorced. Then she remarried in secret some man that she divorced after a few months too. That would be her 3rd failed marriage. \nI was never married once and I don’t think I want to in future neither since I believe real love doesn’t have to be proven by a piece of paper or a ring. \nI started speaking more often with my dad and he told me a few more details of his side of the story why he wasn’t present in my life in the past. Now I only believe some parts of it, some parts I was too young to remember how it actually happened. \nMy memory is starting to fade away sometimes, idk if is because of the ADHD or trauma. Did I seek help to a psychologist in the past? Yes, and I was only taught how to control my anxiety which kinda helped, but I believe medication helped me more overcome my depression. \nShould I still keep contact with my family? I feel like most of the time there is a catch why they linger around and still message me sometimes and demand to talk to me and to call them. \nMy mother promised me some part of my grandmother’s will but in papers she gave it all to my baby sister who just turned 18.\n I spoke with my sister for a while in the past but she seemed to had a grudge against me for leaving when I was 20 (she was 11 that time) and never keep contact with her. I just don’t know how to keep contact with people but deep down I do think about her and care for her is just the words don’t come out. \nI am not fussed about money, as long as I can survive here, all I want is peace of mind and I feel like still keeping contact with them will never cut the invisible threads of manipulation.', 'Illustrious_Cat_556', 'CharlotteDobreYouTube', 'https://reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o2iwau/i_ran_away_from_home_when_i_was_20/', 1, 0, '2025-10-10 03:45:34', '2025-11-07 23:40:41');

(58, 'reddit', '1o1n2ow', 'Friends Just Get in the Way of Watching TV', 'The other night, in a moment of either deep cultural insight or total defeat, I found myself watching *a sitcom* while eating a bowl of cereal that technically expired in April. The show is not bad. I wouldn’t call it great either, but it’s comfortably mediocre in the way that most American lives seem to be designed: familiar, beige, and padded like a La-Z-Boy.\n\nThat’s what makes it perfect, actually. It’s the television equivalent of one of those friends who never expects much from you, and in return, you don’t expect much from them either. But then a line slipped out of the main character\'s mouth and hit me like an empty Pringles can to the forehead.\n\nHe and his on-screen wife were trying to find other married couples to befriend. The problem? Everyone had kids, which is, I’m told, a rather consuming hobby. So finally, in frustration, he said, *“Ahh friends just keep you away from TV anyway.”*\n\nI paused the show. Literally. I paused it and sat there for a moment, spoon suspended mid-air like some sort of dairy-coated oracle, and thought, *My God. That’s it. That’s America.*\n\nWe’ve given up on people.\n\nWe used to build relationships in church basements over bad coffee. We had bowling leagues and block parties and dinner guests who brought Jell-O salads with embedded mysteries. Now we have *The Office* reruns and an ever-growing intimacy with the Hulu “Are you still watching?” prompt, which somehow feels both judgmental and enabling.\n\nIn other countries, ones where they eat meals over three hours and argue about politics with their hands instead of firearms, *people* are the entertainment. Friends are the TV. The social scene is the show. You don’t need HBO Max when you’ve got five opinionated cousins and a bottle of wine.\n\nBut in America, our closest friend is the one we can mute. And we love it that way.\n\nIt’s not entirely our fault. For decades, we’ve been slowly seduced into this low-maintenance lifestyle of solitary delight. Television doesn’t forget your birthday. Television never borrows your tools and returns them broken. Television doesn’t make you go to baby showers or eat vegan lasagna. It simply shows up, does its little dance, and waits patiently until you’ve finished eating dinner in front of it like a civilized animal.\n\nWe have confused accessibility with intimacy. We think because we can see people on screens that we are connected to them. We think because we comment “so cute!” on a coworker’s Instagram photo of their dog in a Halloween costume, that counts as being a good friend. Meanwhile, that coworker wouldn’t recognize you in a lineup unless you were holding a coffee mug with the company’s logo.\n\nAnd when you suggest, *Hey, maybe we should build community,* people respond as if you’ve invited them to a séance.\n\nI once tried to start a neighborhood potluck. I made fliers and slipped them under doormats like a community-minded raccoon. One woman texted me to say she was gluten-free and spiritually opposed to casseroles. Another guy replied with just the word “unsubscribe.” One neighbor opened her door, read the flier, and shut it in my face without saying a word. It’s hard to build a sense of belonging when everyone’s already booked to binge something that’s been on Netflix since two administrations ago.\n\nIf we keep going this way, where does it end? Do we just plug into our favorite sitcom and stop answering the doorbell altogether? Will future generations be born with HDMI ports at the base of their skull? Our children, if we ever bother to interact long enough to produce them, will know nothing of phone calls or potlucks or the sheer awkward ecstasy of unplanned social interaction. They’ll just blink to change the channel and sip their meal replacements through the same tube that feeds their soul.\n\nI don’t want to live in that world. I want to know someone who burns the rice. Someone whose dog barks the entire time we try to talk. Someone who tells me too much about their digestive issues but still shows up when I need help moving a couch. Friends are messy. They’re exhausting. But they make the day real. You don’t get that from Season 9 of anything.\n\nSo maybe it’s time to stand up. Stretch. Turn off the TV. Walk outside and talk to the neighbor whose name you forgot but whose Wi-Fi you’ve been stealing for years. Invite someone over, even if your sink is full of dishes and your toilet paper is the kind they sell in gas stations. Because the moment you choose people over pixels, you begin to remember what being human actually feels like.\n\nIt’s not as smooth as streaming.

(60, 'reddit', '1o1eat3', 'Down in the Gulf', 'Prologue\n\nI wish my pilot instructors could see me now. Flying \'op-force\', pretending to be a drug smuggler to train Coast Guard crews! Low altitude to stay under the radar. Low speed to keep my heat signature down. Flying straight toward radar sites to keep my profile small. It\'s below the horizon, but I can see the reflected glow of Pensacola over my left wing as I head to a small airstrip north of Tampa.\n\n\"What\'s that bright light high up to the North?\" Engine died! Auto pilot is gone. \"Mayday! Mayday!\" Radio is down. \n\nRudder and flaps still work. Flat turn into the waves and nose up to lose speed. Loosing too much speed, nose down. Just above stall and almost wave top high. Check harness!\n\n\n\nCRUNCH!\n\n\n\nI\'m down and floating, but I don\'t know for how long. Deploy life raft. Plane is going down slowly, but going down never the less. Life raft is out, what else? Ice chest, check. I guess my fishing trip is out but there is room for my tackle box. CO2 fire extinguisher, don\'t know what for, but why not. Toolbox, check. Flare gun and flares, check. What else? Oh, my personal bag and I\'m out of the cabin.\n\nPaddle around to the cargo hatch. Oh, Man! The tail broke completely off and is gone. Can\'t get the hatch open but I can reach in from the tail. Everything is jammed! All I can get out is the bottom half of one of my rods and it\'s open face reel. There she goes! She wasn\'t mine, but I\'m going to miss her. What I won\'t miss will be the days spent filling out forms when I get back to base.\n\nBack to here and now. Shelter is up and beacon light is flashing on top. It will be awhile before anyone gets here, probably mid morning. Get everything arranged, no corners or sharp edges near the raft wall or floor. I know it cost more than I could really afford, I\'m am glad I bought a top of the line, four man raft rather than rely on the raft they provided that is still jammed up with the rest of the stuff in the tail of the plane. Now I have room to stretch out, I\'m going to get some sleep.\n\nBeginning of day one:\n\nAh the breakfast of champions, an almost cold bottle of Dr. Pepper and the leftover half of a bag of chips.   I have the six inch sub and four more bottles of Dr. Pepper in the ice chest that was suppose to be for my fishing trip lunch.   I hope to be rescued before I need to get into my emergency supplies.\n\nThe sea anchor is out and tight, I guess the breeze is moving the raft along.   There\'s a yellow Mylar and foil kite in the kit, I think there is enough wind to launch it.   It is suppose to make me easier to find with eye or radar.\n\nI wonder if I can get a cellphone signal out here?   I heard they were putting cell towers on the oil rigs.   I didn\'t think my phone got wet, but it won\'t come on.   My radio has a crank and solar charger along with a USB port I can hook my phone into.   I\'ll put them into a dry, sunny spot to dry and charge.\n\nMorning day three:\n\nWind must have died sometime last night, the kite is down.   Good thing it floats, or it would have been another sea anchor if the line didn\'t break.   I have to start bringing it in after sundown.\n\nMy phone fully charged, but won\'t come on.   My radio, that was in my aluminum personal bag, sort of works.   AM and FM are nothing but static.   Short Wave has static but I can hear faint voices that I can\'t understand the words.   I wished I had saved some wire from the plane, I could run an antenna up the kite line.   Maybe tonight I will get a better signal.\n\nNo sign of any search.   I haven\'t even seen a contrail since I started looking yesterday.   If I see one, there is a slim chance that they would see the reflection of my mirror, but a slim chance is better than no chance.\n\nI started on the survival rations last night.   It was a basic four person, two meals a day, two week kit.   One hundred ration bars, two dozen freeze dried meals, and eight half gallon water bags in it.   That\'s only enough water for two days for four people, but it has a water filter for fresh water and four floating solar stills.    Aquamate Solar Stills produce one to four pints a day, which is at max barely enough for an adult for a day.\n\nOne thing no one mentions in stories is how boring it is being alone in a raft.   I\'ve read all the manuals that came with the raft and equipment, twice.   I finished one of the paperbacks I had in my personal bag and almost finished the other one.\n\nWell, the kite is dry, I guess I\'ll launch it.   I am going to do some fishing.   What I\'ll do with them if I catch some I don\'t know, I don\'t care for sushi.\n\nDay five:\n\nI\'m  tired for a change.   I was up all night last night filling containers with rain water.   Everything that would hold water, including myself, that wasn\'t keeping something dry is full.   The wind kept pushing the raft along inside a rain storm.   The wind and waves weren\'t too bad but it rained hard.\n\nDay eight:\n\nHad a scare today.   I was taking care of some \'personal business\' this morning and a small bull sharks bumped the raft.   It was less than five feet long, but I was holding a rope stretched across the raft as I was hanging over the side.   I had heard that urine attracts sharks.   Since I am not a shark, I don\'t know if they mistake urine for blood or if they think the urine is from a large school of fish.   It\'s not big enough to kill you quick or eat you quick, but out here any major injury can kill you.   No gun but a flare gun and outside of Hollywood, it is hard to kill or drive off a shark with a flare.   Tying a knife to an oar is a good way to loose both. Maybe I\'ll hit it over the head with the fire extinguisher.\n\nMorning Day nine:\n\nStill no AM or FM radio, but I heard something on Shortwave that I could understand last night.   Somebody in northern Idaho was retelling what he heard from the West Coast.   Either whoever had set off the EMP bomb had miscalculated or had a second one that didn\'t go off because electronics that were in valleys that didn\'t face east in the western mountains were protected.   Also on the southern West Coast the damage was lighter and no damage farther out in the Pacific or Alaska.   After the EMP, some pilots got replacement electronics out of protected storage and repaired their crop dusters all across the country.   Most of the pilots were South Americans, but there were diverse groups such as Aryan Brotherhood and Radical Black Muslims.   Many of the planes had \"FEMA\" or \"DHS\" stenciled on their wings and sides.\n\nThe planes sprayed diseases, typhoid, cholera, and such.   Information gained from one South American pilot that was captured while refueling said they were to target operating transportations, large groups of people, residential neighborhoods, and government buildings.   The hate groups focused on the ones their hate was towards.   The plane spraying Hollywood stopped spraying and attacked the one spraying the Barrios.   The two planes exchanged pistol shots until the both crashed into a radio tower.   In San Diego, another was shot down as it approached the Marine base.   The explosion and fire didn\'t destroy all the typhoid that was in the tanks.   The base is locked down as they try to stop the epidemic.\n\nThere were similar sprayings in Europe, Russia, and Asia.   Fighting with conventional weapons has broken out in Africa and the Middle East.   Mostly it is tribe or sect against tribe or sect.   U.S. military commanders are trying to return with their commands intact.   They are finding it most difficult to get out of countries that wanted them the least.\n\nAlaska is deporting most foreign nationals.   People that were trying to become citizens are being judged on a case by case basis.   Some are being sent to the lower 48.\n\nSouth America is in turmoil.   The leadership of several countries were killed by small groups of black clad men.   After that several laboratories and factories had mysterious fires and explosions.   \n\nWhat this means to me is that there is no one that is going to be looking for me.   If I am going to be rescued, I will have to rescue myself.   I\'ve pulled the kite and sea anchor.   The cover has been reset to act as a sail.  The wind continues out of the southwest and I am using an oar for a rudder to steer toward the north or northeast.\n\nDay twelve:\n\nI am seeing an occasional seabird in the distance, I must be getting closer to land.   I\'ve gotten so tired of food bars, sushi doesn\'t sound so bad now.   I had caught a fish this morning, but lost it to what looks like the same small bull shark.   Not only did I lose the fish, I lost one of my favorite lures.   If I\'m out here much longer, I will need to do something about that shark.\n\nDay thirteen:\n\nWater is getting low again.   I put out two of the floating stills.   I get almost three quarts of water from them.   I drink an ounce or two of seawater every evening to replace salt and minerals.   Much more that that is counter productive, causing the body to loose water and salts.\n\nAfternoon day fifteen:\n\nRained this morning. Not as hard or as long as last time, but I collected about four and a half gallons of water plus what I drank.\n\nDay eighteen:\n\nLast evening I saw seabirds flying north and east at sundown.   Land is getting closer.\n\nDay twenty:\n\nI finally did it, the bull shark and I had it out.   It kept rubbing on the same spot on the raft and I was afraid it would wear a hole in the raft.   I saved up a days worth of urine.   Caught two small fish near the raft.   I cut the smaller one into small pieces and put the large one on the end of the nozzle of the CO2 fire extinguisher.   When everything was ready, I dumped the urine, then the chopped up fish.   When the shark showed up, I put fish on the end of the extinguisher into the water.   When the shark went to bite the fish, I shoved the nozzle as far as I could into the shark\'s mouth and pulled the trigger.   I don\'t know if it was the cold, the pressure, or both, but the shark thrashed twice and rolled belly up.   I didn\'t know if it was just stunned, so I quickly gutted it.   Shark tartar is not bad after more than two weeks of meal bars.\n\nDay twenty one:\n\nBreakfast was more shark tartar with the hot sauce from the freeze dried meals.   The shark jaw is hanging below the raft for the fish to clean.  There are strips of meat and fins hanging to dry in the sun.   There is more shark than I can eat before it goes bad, so if it doesn\'t dry, I won\'t consider it wasted.   I\'ve saved some of the shark skin.   Have I mentioned how boring it is being on a raft alone?\n\nNight of day twenty three:\n\nJust before sundown I saw light reflecting off the mast of a ship. I took a compass bearing and headed toward it.   I sailed on until I thought I would be close to it.   I put down the sail and put out the sea anchor.   I\'m going to put this flashlight away and try to get some sleep, tomorrow promises to be a busy day.\n\nEvening of day twenty four:\n\n\n\nI am sitting here at a table and eating the most delicious thing I have ever eaten, a can of generic chicken and rice soup. This is after three weeks of meal bars and raw shark.\n\n\n\nWhen it started to get light this morning I started to look for the ship. Of course I was looking in the wrong direction. It was west of me and I couldn\'t see it until the sun came over the horizon. It was a few hundred yards off and it took me more than two hours to paddle the raft to it. There was no signs of life except for three gulls that were sitting on the aft railing.\n\n\n\nAfter I tied off the raft and climbed aboard, the first thing I saw were the remains in the stern. Between the weather and the gulls, there wasn\'t much left but bones and rags. There were signs of two people, two coffee cups in the sink, two unmade beds, and such. My best guess was one of them had gone over the side. The boat, the \"Right Angler\", was a private fishing boat out of Destin, FL. The fuel tanks are half full which should be enough fuel to reach Pensacola or maybe Tampa. The twenty pound propane tank that ran the fridge was almost empty, the one on the stove was almost full and one of the two spares was full. There wasn\'t much eatable in the fridge, some pickles, some olives, and a block of cheddar that I ate after I trimmed off the gray.\n\n\n\nI decided to go back to Pensacola, since that is where I was based. I bagged the bones and rags that were on the deck. By the time I had the raft unloaded, deflated, and everything put away, it was late afternoon. I didn\'t think it would be wise to approach the base in the dark. With some difficulty I got the engines started and idled northward to charge the batteries and to check to see if everything was working with the boat.\n\n\n\nA couple of hours after dark I checked and the batteries were fully charged so I shut off the engines and prepared my feast. When I get through eating I plan on changing the sheets on one of the bunks and see if I remember how to sleep in a bed.\n\n\n\nDay twenty five:\n\n\n\nI wake up before dawn as usual but it took me a while to remember where I was.   I heated a can of stew for breakfast.   After breakfast I restarted the engines and headed north again.   After the sun was up I checked the horizon and saw dark clouds to the southwest.   I moved the throttle a little more open.   Not as fuel efficient, but neither is being overtaken by a storm.   By the time I could see the Pensacola skyline, the storm was just a dark line on the horizon.   The skyline told me where I was, so I turned toward the naval base.\n\n\n\nAbout two miles out I saw a cutter headed towards me.   There is no way this boat could outrun it and I didn\'t want to, I cut back the throttle.   When they started slowing down I cut it back to idle.   When they stopped, I stopped.   They dropped a ship\'s boat off the lee side of the cutter.   Four people got on the boat.   The first got behind the controls and the second got behind the thirty cal. machinegun and trained it on my boat.   That was in addition to the fifty cal. or twenty mm that was on the bow of the cutter.   I made no sudden moves.\n\nEpilogue:\n\n\"Name and reason for being in restricted water.\"\n\n\"Captain Mary Stillwater and I am returning to base, Chief.\"\n\n\"What is your call sign?\"\n\n\"Deep.\"\n\n\"Hold\" and the chief petty officer called back to his ship on the radio.\n\n\"They are confirming your information back at base.\"\n\n\"I see operation \'Mayhem\' worked.\"\n\n\"Yes Ma\'am, they got some electronics out of a bunker and had a helicopter in the air in just a half hour after the attack.   I heard that 95% of communications are online at the base and 70% of the aircraft are flight worthy.\"\n\n\"Chief, you are a little free with information.\"\n\n\"No ma\'am, I remember you.   I was working base security the night you busted up that drunk civilian contractor.\"\n\n\"He tripped and fell on the stairs.\"\n\n\"Yes ma\'am, that is what the official report said, but it seems rather difficult to dislocate your right shoulder, break your nose, and crush your left instep in a fall on some stairs when you end up at the top of the stairs.   I heard the self defense instructor mention almost all the women in that barracks signed up for advanced self defense classes.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that chief, I heard on the short wave about what happened out west, what happened here?\"\n\n\"The base commander put the base on lockdown immediately.   When there was enough vehicles running he sent convoys out to pick up off base personal and what families that were willing to come.   The helicopter saw the plane spraying the city on the way to the base.   They forced it down in the bay.\"\n\n\"Did they get the pilot?\"\n\n\"They put some hazmat suits on and took a boat out.   They thought it might have been some type of nerve gas and got a sample from the tank.   They went through full de-com when they got back to base and they were fine, but the pilot died from an antibiotic resistant pneumonia.\n\nThe pilot was from Bolivia and thought he was learning to fly for the Cartels.   When they filled his tanks, they gave him a pill and told him it would protect him.  We lost a lot of people in town, but it seems to be under control.   Anyone going into town or coming onto the base has to go through quarantine and get tested.\"\n\n\"Me too?\"\n\n\"Considering you have not been in contact with anyone, probably not.   You will still have to go to the infirmary and get checked out.   Afterwards you will probably have to fill out a bunch of paperwork explaining why your paperwork is not up to date.\"\n\n\"Civilization may be ending, but somebody has to have their paperwork done.\"\n\n\"It\'s not as bad as it was, the C.O. has been pulling able bodies out of offices and putting them to work.   I think he hates paperwork and is enjoying eliminating a bunch of busy work.\n\n\"The Skipper says to bring you on board.   What do you want to do with the boat?\"\n\n\"It\'s a good boat, can we tow it in or fuel it up some and have someone drive it in?   Let me get my gear.   Would the cook like some dried shark?\"\n\nThe End', 'Freebirde777', 'freebirde777', 'https://reddit.com/r/freebirde777/comments/1o1eat3/down_in_the_gulf/', 1, 0, '2025-10-08 21:50:47', '2025-11-07 23:40:41'),

Yet TasteAtlas gives all the credit to Spain.\n\nSame thing with arroz con pollo (chicken rice). It’s cooked in at least 20 different countries, each with its own twist, but again, all the recognition goes to Spain.\n\nAnd empanadas? Same story. Spain takes the spotlight, with a small nod to Chile and Argentina, while many other countries get ignored completely.\n\nMany nations are working hard to showcase their cuisine on a global stage because food isn’t just about eating; it’s about culture, identity, and tourism. But sites like TasteAtlas often undermine that effort through cultural bias or plain ignorance.\n\nIn the case of Colombia, many traditional dishes are left out sometimes because they share names with others, or due to debates with neighboring countries like Venezuela.

(65, 'reddit', '1oi8rvw', 'Kiritimati (Christmas) Island, Kiribati', 'My friend and I decided to take a trip to Kiritimati Island, mostly for the novelty that it sits almost as far east as you can get near the International Dateline. Despite sharing the same time zone as Hawaii, it is a full day ahead due to the dateline shift in 1995, ensuring the entire country of Kiribati would share the same calendar day. That quirky geographic twist also makes Kiribati the only country that spans all four hemispheres.\n\nKiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) is a large coral atoll with a population of around 7,500 spread across four inhabited villages. The airport (CXI) is located in the village of Banana. The main village is London, with Tabwakea nearby in between, and Poland and the now-abandoned village of Paris on the far side of the island.\n\nAccommodation options are few, and we ended up staying at Lagoon View, located between London and Tabwakea. Getting to Kiritimati requires some coordination, since there are only two flights a week and both operate on the same day: HNL–CXI–NAN and NAN–CXI–HNL on Fiji Airways. Visitors are effectively committed to staying for a week at a time unless catching one of the rare inter-island flights.\n\nTransportation on the island is simple. There is one main road, so between London and Tabwakea we would just stand by it and wait for a passing truck to stop. Locals were incredibly kind about giving rides, and it helped that our hotel had a giant sailboat out front, so everyone knew where to drop us off.\n\nWe rented bikes one day and rode past Tabwakea where traffic thinned out even further. Another day we rented a small motorcycle and rode out to the southeast tip of the island, the former site of British and American nuclear and hydrogen bomb tests. The ride was beautiful and once past Banana, nearly deserted. There is a compact dirt road that crosses to Poland, but we skipped that since we were two-up on the bike and unsure about fuel availability in the tiny village.\n\nThe lagoon is very shallow, so for swimming I headed to the ocean side. I had hopes of scuba diving, but visitors must bring all their own gear except tanks and weights, so I settled for snorkeling and swimming the reefs right offshore, which was still fantastic.\n\nLagoon View provided three meals a day. Breakfast and dinner were hot, while lunch was packed cold for whenever we wanted to eat. Options were simple, usually pancakes or eggs in the morning and fish, rice, chicken, pasta, or frozen vegetables at dinner. Supply runs to a remote atoll are no small feat, so we appreciated every meal.\n\nThere was no cell coverage for us initially, so we bought Vodafone SIM cards in London village. At the time, eSIM wasn’t available, so anyone with a phone lacking a SIM slot would be out of luck. Even then, the service hovered somewhere between 2G and 3G. Thankfully, the hotel had Starlink, which worked well whenever the power stayed on.\n\nMost visitors come to Kiritimati for bonefishing. Since neither of us fish, we were definitely the odd ones out. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about spending a full week on such a small island, but it turned into one of my favorite vacations ever. The entire experience felt peaceful, unexpected, and incredibly welcoming.', 'Fit-Garbage-2259', 'travel', 'https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1oi8rvw/kiritimati_christmas_island_kiribati/', 1877, 62, '2025-10-28 19:02:42', '2025-11-07 23:40:41'),

(67, 'reddit', '1o1d9zq', 'Saying goodbye to our Ripley', 'Hello all,\n\nI have never made a post in here but I have really loved the community offering love and support during the happy, hard, and sad times. I have had this dog since she was 1  and  my spouse met her in early 2021. She is days away from 14. We have been discussing this awful topic for weeks and have set a date for tomorrow afternoon. I am looking for any excuse to not go through with it but our little angel is not who she once was. Over the past year her anxiety and dementia have gotten worse. We have tried multiple medications at different times and they seemed to help some (senilife, selegiline, xanax, acepromazine, trazadone, gabbapentin, CBD oil, galliprant, etc.) She finally eats consistently again after switching her food several times to finally get her to eat something other than chicken and rice. After starting the selegiline and us taking her off the xanax she stopped having as many accidents in the house. Her sleep through the night has been horrible for months. We are all exhausted and now a lot of mornings she has a hard time settling back down. During the day while we work (both work from home) she will lay in her bed between both our doorways. That is the time she rests the most. From 3:30ish til we go to bed 9:00pm she is pacing or unable to settle. If we leave the house for something, which we have tried to avoid for weeks if not months, she will get thrown off and it can result in a very panicked whine when we get back. It is so hard to see and very clear she is terrified or does not understand. I could go on and on about all of the other things but the thing I finally said out loud yesterday was \"I do not remember the last time she had a fun day\". She has random good moments and is always excited to eat treats but other than that she does not enjoy any of her favorite things anymore. When my spouse came home from a work trip a little over a week ago, Ripley did not show much excitement when they arrived home. \n\n  \nTo add to all of this...we are moving in 2 weeks. We have been packing up the house over several weeks now. Luckily it seems her dementia has prevented her from noticing too much. Years ago when we would pack a small suitcase she knew we were going on a trip and would sulk and avoid us. You all know how emotion our bostons are. We are moving across the country to a new house, new state, and I  just keep thinking how can I stop this appointment tomorrow. I know deep inside me that it is the right call and a good friend of mine said, \"it is a kindness to allow for a gentle passing\". She doesn\'t seem like she is in major pain, she struggles up/down stairs and we pick her up a lot of the time. She isn\'t cleaning herself anymore without our help. I think my spouse and I have become blind to a lot of it and I am just reaching out to strangers because I am so broken inside. This dog has been through a major part of me trying to become a real adult. A divorce, the loss of my father, and temporarily moving twice.

(69, 'reddit', '1oc7ivz', 'Is it really ok to eat soy sauce?', 'I’m working with a group of local chefs &amp; guides on a community project to make our small town the first gluten free friendly town in Japan. 🍙 \n\nWe’ve spent nearly a year working on all our safety processes, guides and translation cards etc and everything is based around avoiding soy sauce and bringing your own GF soy sauce (tamari)\n\nObviously soy sauce is a big issue in Japan and rules out A LOT of otherwise GF foods. \n\nI’ve been seeing more and more research saying traditionally brewed soy sauce is GF. \n\nIs this true? Is it true for some? Given that most soy sauce in Japan in traditionally brewed, do we need to make 2 versions of our tools and resources for those who can eat soy sauce and those that can’t? \n\nThank you so much for your help. We are very confused :/\n\nUPDATE:\n\nTake so far:\n\n1 some people say it’s safe because the fermentation process of “real” soy sauce removes gluten from the wheat. Celiac societies in Sweden, Denmark and Finland (?) take this position. Info [here, links in English](https://ncf.no/glutenfri-mat/kosthold-og-ernering/vanlig-soyasaus-er-glutenfri-og-kan-brukes-av-de-med-coliaki). Thanks to u/sudden_crumpet\n\nIn the opposing corner is:\n\n2. The fermentation process doesn’t actually remove the gluten it just removes the markers that show up in tests. So the soy sauce still does harm, but just flies under the radar\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nThere is a difference between “real” soy sauce that is fermented and “cheap” soy sauce that isn’t processed the same way and may have added malt. \n\nWe would need to do some work to understand the risk of someone eating “fake” soy sauce thinking they’re eating “real” soy sauce. (fake and real are just my shorthand terms, not in general use)\n\nUPDATE 3:\n\nSo far it’s as we feared. \n\nThere seem to be 2 distinct schools of thought / lived experiences - with no sweet spot in between. \n\nIt’s will double our workload but it seems like we will need to produce two sets of guides and translation tools and rankings and make it very clear that one assumes soy sauce is ok (aligned with Sweden, Norway etc) and one assumes it’s not (aligned with the majority of counties). We will let the users decide what works for them. \n\nUPDATE 4:\nSome concerns emerging about possible mixed messages and people preferring a “dangerous until proven safe” approach. \n\nUPDATE 5: **Context from Japan**\nSome context about specific challenges to managing celiac in Japan. \n\nGluten intolerance and celiac disease are basically invisible in Japan. Wheat and traces of wheat has to be listed on labels, but barley, rye, oats etc don’t. \n\nThere’s no national gluten-free certification, and even if a chef avoids cross-contact in the kitchen, almost every bottled or packaged ingredient carries trace risk from manufacturing.(shout out to the work of the [Japan Rice Flour Association to change this](https://www.tokyoupdates.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/post-882/))\n\nIn the future it might make sense to ask chefs to swap out soy sauce for GF tamari - but for now picture asking chefs in your own country to overhaul their pantry for a condition they’ve never heard of, affecting maybe one in a thousand guests - nearly all of whom are foreign visitors who don’t speak your language. They might care because people are often kind, but it the feeling in our group is that it will be hard to get traction right now in Japan. \n\nIn our small town chefs are swapping to GF ingredients because people here are famously warm and open-hearted, and we’ve framed it as a community-led slow tourism project. That’s how we’re winning hearts first.\n\nAcross Japan though, the realistic path is probably not swapping to GF tamari, at least not overnight. What we are doing instead is finding restaurants that are already close to gluten-free and helping them make small, customer-led tweaks. That keeps things safe for most travelers who can handle trace gluten.\n\nFor strict celiacs who can’t, we’re creating one “sanctuary town” with GF kitchens and proper training.\n\n**UPDATE 6:**\n\nThe mods have kindly allowed us to share the name of our project. \n\nThe town is stunning beautiful **Hida Furukawa** in the **Hida region** near Takayama, UNESCO listed Shirakawa-go thatched hut village, Okuhida Onsen-go and Kamikochi.\n\nOur region is famous for carpentry, beef, yakusou herblore, its alpine setting and - I can say this as a new migrant - it’s wonderful friendly and welcoming community. \n\nOur project is still a baby. We’ve been developing it since our friends who can’t eat gluten came to visit in Feb this year. The collaboration is called **ITADAKI** and is about heath, slow tourism and removing barriers for travellers (we are also doing a project for people with MS). \n\nThis project is called **The Hida GFF Project** (gluten free friendly)\n\nWe are on IG @HidaGFF and there is an intake form at www.EatEasyJapan.com for anyone who wants to help us ground test the guides and tools or to get a copy of the walking map and free translation card. \n\nPlease keep in mind this project is really new and this is the first community we’ve shared our work with - we are learning a lot here. Please do let us know if any info we are sharing is wrong, incomplete or misleading so we can fix it immediately. \n\n—-\n\nPlease share any ideas for approaches or solutions &amp; let me know if I’m missing anything. 🤔 \n\nAlso, other people working on our project are smarter and more conscientious about detail than me, so if there are any mistakes here they are all mine!

Which country do you feel closest to the most?**  \nWe were close with a lot of them. I would say Japan, Korea, Mongolia. Who else... Indo. Yeah, it was just whoever was filming with you that specific day. (*Potential spoiler? Or he\'s messing with us*).\n\n**2. How much rest did you get between each quest?**  \nIt was never the same. It would be on, it would be off, it would be on. You just had to be ready. We had our waiting rooms with snacks galore, we had  mattresses and everything. I\'m telling you, we got spoiled. We were looked after. Korea is awesome.\n\n**3. How long were the shooting days?**  \nThe filming days were looong. But we got spoiled with food, spoiled with snacks. It was amazing.\n\n**4. Is there going to be a Physical Pacific?**  \nI can\'t say no, because they might want to see that. It depends on what Korea does, it\'s their licensing and their show. So yeah, it depends on what they want to film.\n\n**5. Did you have a chance to talk to Pacquiao?**  \nYes, I shook his hand, I was gobsmacked. But then, after one of the challenges, I was playing my guitar, and he walks past and goes \"Man, we should jam.\" And I wish, but he had to leave the next day. Maybe sometime soon I can play guitar and he sings or vice versa.  Make some harmonies.\n\n**6. What do you think about the Turkish team?**  \nThey\'re great, nothing wrong with them. We just haven\'t competed against them since the first quest, so everyone thinking I\'m not talking about them, it\'s because we didn\'t get to compete against each other. (*Another big spoiler, unless he\'s lying on purpose.*)\n\n**7. Who taught the Aussie team Korean phrases like \'Bab mukja\' (let\'s eat)? I love how y\'all embrace culture.**  \nI asked how to say \"Let\'s eat\" because I wanted to learn the language so people could see we were actually trying to get amongst the Korean, you know, we wanted to have fun. I thought that line would get popular, and I thought I could scream it while we were competing. While we were saying it, Stun Gun (*Kim Dong Hyun*) was trying really hard not to laugh. Because why would you say \'Bab mukja\'??\n\n**8. How was the food and hotel at Physical Asia? (*****Eddie really loved the food questions, lol*****).**  \nThe food was amazing... \'bab mukja.\' It\'s why I couldn\'t fit into some of my hanboks (*Korean traditional clothing*). The food was elite, the protein, all the fruit, oh man, we got spoiled (*Eddie says that a lot, lol*). Felt like I was at the Olympics. High level meats, bulgogi was my favorite. Bulgogi and rice so good. Rice and eggs, bulgogi, chicken, wahhh, everything elite.\n\n**9. Your most favorite quest in the show?**  \nShipwreck. The size of the shit! It was like a shopping mall. And then I\'d go the wrestling. Oh no, ship wreck, group challenge, and then the wrestling one.\n\n**10. Who\'s your favorite team?**  \nI\'d have to say Philippines, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Turkey... all the teams. Everyone was nice. You know, it was just when we went to compete it was like...

Her monthly paycheck is about $4,300. Rent is $3,500—add utilities, food, gas to get to work, and medical expenses, and it\'s just not doable. So you go into debt.

I am researching about the daily life of Pakistani people.\n\nI am researching about how my life might be if i ever consider locating to Pakistan. Turkish people have sympathy towards Pakistani people because of their support during Turkish War of Independence (1920). I am a Muslim and pray five times a day. I speak fluent English but I don\'t speak any Urdu. I can read Arabic alphabet but only Holy Quran. I can barely read ottoman Turkish texts and i can slowly conversate in Arabic.\n\nSo here are my questions. Please answer them with detailed explanations. So i understand your thinking. 1. Are there any Turkish speaking minorities living in Karachi? If yes how many people are living? Do you think I can adept to Pakistani living easily? I mean adepting to cuisine, way of drinking tea, spices and preparing own food. Do you consume chicken?\n\n2. I researched about economics (cost of living in Pakistan versus Türkiye) and it is very very much puzzling how economics can be. I ask about rough estimates because they say 500 usd is sufficient for a comfortable cost of living. So, here is my question. a)What is the rent or mortgage cost of a typical 100 square meters flat? I can even consider the full price of the house for my research. You can give PKR numbers and i will consider them for my research. b) Next question is about a beater car. What is the typical price of a Fiat Fiorino at Pakistan? I can consider second hand vehicles and 50k to 250k kilometers mileage is acceptable for me. What is the most common van with windows at Pakistan? What brand of automobiles are the most popular? C) Is Pakistan right hand drive or left hand drive? At Türkiye the driver is situated at the left front row seat and we drive on the right lane. We overtake on the left lane. D) are there suburban accommodation at Karachi.  I would happily commute 2 hours every day.\n\n3. How is the general public opinion towards Turks among Pakistani citizens? Do you think i can socialize with Pakistani people if there is no language barrier?\n\n4. How long does a game of cricket last? (In minutes or hours) I only played softball during my university years once. I just saw a photo of it when i was a child and cricket is puzzling for me even as a spectator. I mentioned baseball/softball because they look similar games for a Turkish spectator.\n\n5) Is there a universal health care for every citizen and foreigner at Pakistan? Thank Allah I don\'t have pre existing health concerns. I visit my general practitioner  every six months for vitamin d and usually prefer social security network of hospitals. How is the health care cost of Karachi? Please tell the cost a new prescription glasses and dental tooth extraction? \n\n6) Are there convenience stores (groceries) at Karachi? I mean the type that sells most of your grocery items. Rice, flour, tea, kitchen supplies, bathroom supplies and bread. I am a avid bread eater and i plan to bake my own bread at a house oven. Do you consume bread? Do you consume milk produce? I mean I eat a lot of cheese, olives and drink milk. Can i buy bottled or fresh milk for everyday consumption?\n\n7) Türkiye has two type of banks and some other financial institutions. The first type is banks that doesn\'t practice interest and second type is banks that practice interest. I would like to know about how Pakistani state regulates banks. Do Pakistani banks operate with interest?\n\n8) I would be more happy about my decision if i can relocate to Pakistan/Karachi indefinitely. Would Karachi offer me outdoor sports chances like hiking, camping and swimming? I used to go to gym in the evenings. I used to commute to my employment with a bicycle. I have experience with most sports. Do you think i can continue practicing those sports? I said indefinitely because locating to a country for a few years is cheaper.\n\n9) What is the minimum wage a Pakistani is earning? In PKR. I just mentioned a theoretical quiet and peaceful life in my questions. Would a foreigner be able to live on own for 130k- 150k PKR monthly salary at Karachi? I don\'t think that kind of salary is realistic, i just made up that number to spark a discussion. \n\n10) is there 4 distinct seasons for Karachi?

I\'ve seen and experienced life here in their big cities, little towns and everything between, I\'ve drank beer with arrogant foreigners in their exclusive private executive gated sub-division bubbles and expensive rich lifestyle homes, I\'ve visited filipino slums and squatter shacks and villages located in flood zones and garbage dumps, been out into and even lived in some of their rural remote bukidnon (mountains) areas where NPA and terrorists have been observed, lived at a few beach resorts for a while and have seen and experienced first hand disaster events like major earthquakes, landslides and typhoons. \n\nSo I ask you op, please, just open your eyes and look around. What do you see? Be honest.

I\'d get em over and over again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uon0hyoxjqvf1.jpg?width=6032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116e382bea6b75a25a5b5454c80a033e6372801f\n\nQuail Egg: I put some caviar on top, tasted really nice at the back taste\n\n**Pancakes with spread and caviar**: Hoooooooly shit this is SO FFFF GOOOOOOOOOOD THESE BABY ASS PANCAKES WITH THIS TASTY ASS SPREAD AND SALTY CAVIAR COMBO IS LOVE!! PURE BLISS &amp; LOVE!!! I CAN LITERALLY JUST EAT THIS ALL NIGHT LONG!\n\nYO! THE WAITER SAW THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF PANCAKES AND BROUGHT IN A WHOLE BATCH MORE OF IT!!! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2q66xgq2iqvf1.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d085bb25ea075f5612219445fb82393f6d5854f\n\n**TUNA CARPACCIO**\n\nIt\'s alright-good. The jelly residue underneath is sour, which isn\'t a bad thing. The tuna carpaccio is in the territory of \"too salty\" to be honest.\n\nThey also started serving bread at this point, really good bread, great butter, great sauce. Really good.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ew0j5q7fiqvf1.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e335e76c091a2392dc239222f41cff2def147883\n\n**Scallops:**\n\nThese were okay-good, probably wouldn’t get it again. I feel like they were more ambitious than good. It’s cool though, it’s nice to try once. The fried onions give it a nice touch. The mix of sauces are nice too, but I think that’s where it leans a bit more into the ambitious side. Not the best scallops I’ve had, a tiny bit chewy, but overall decent.\n\nKind of look like moths tbh\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsit3gpmiqvf1.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=151b5d97ecf691daf1c8a57c86de7a6d2078d90c\n\n**Grilled Octopus:**\n\nDefinitely a winner at the Octopus Olympics. Gold-Silver-Bronze.. doesn\'t matter. We\'re talking about a world-class level octopus right here. Amazing seasoning. I\'ll repeat it later, just so you can digest this information properly.\n\nAbsolutely delicious octopus. The seasoning is peak here. Max season. Amazing sauce and this barley rice type thing underneath. It tasted so DAMN good. I think right now, this octopus, the oysters, the caviar pancake spread, are top top top top of the line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myi76uo2jqvf1.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ded128badbc971fb6f4f26a16b01af64f252c4c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbhbbvv7kqvf1.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d10d9ee1161529bb8171e5961512bceade39c4c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h97x30ndkqvf1.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a234d87ea70e5a283348a77ed179d5d661453c4a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2z6iaqdgkqvf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def2b9713f974f7485f08ce043e65ef247b2b46f\n\ncool black pasta:\n\nAmazing initial taste, back taste tooooooo salty. way too salty. come on man. literally just get the seasoning right and you\'d have something amazing here.\n\nRed pasta:\n\nPasta way too hard, and still too salty, but not to the extremity of the previous one.\n\nPink-Purple pasta:\n\nPerfect mixture. Good texture pasta, perfect balance of seasoning, good cheese amount. This one was good. But not the best pasta in general. It was good though.\n\nIf you come to this place though, just skip the pasta. you\'re not missing anything.

I believe I ordered 12 dishes to get to the getting full point. Ok. I\'m not one to complain about price. But come on. Portions. Price. and the taste???? I\'ll gladly spend $800 if the food is mindblowingly good. **Maré Porto Vecchio** wasn\'t cheap either, but the food was so damn good that I didn\'t care how much it cost. I dropped over $1,000 at **Beroya** and I got waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more items/portions/food and was so happy to spend it because we ate so well that day at my boy\'s son\'s 1 month old gathering celebration.\n\nThe caviar with baby pancakes and quail eggs, the octopus, and the oysters, were up to par. However, if you were to go to this place and have only those 3 dishes, it would cost you: $150 + $32 + $26 =$208.00 + tax + tip ... and you would be STARVING!!!!\n\nI told my friends I give this place a **7.5,** but to be honest, now that I\'ve typed this out.

That being said, there were a couple utterly fantastic components, so we will touch on those later. Rancidity and blandness did this one in. Still, what an experience! Best by date is Oct 2023, so we are 2 years over that and it showed.\n\nA sweet 24 hr setup that even included a couple cups! One for the coffee and one for the orange drink? Not sure what to make the 3 teas in!\n\nThis ration had all the meals self contained as shown in Pic 3. That was interesting to find for sure! The 3 in 1 coffee was as expected, similar to IMP 3 in 1.\n\nPics 1-7 show packaging and contents.\n\nPic 8 shows the honey and orange drink. Honey was just normal honey, nothing special. Orange drink was fine but definitely tasted it\'s age.\n\nPic 9 shows the single orange candy in the ration. This was great!\n\nPics 10 and 11 were an interesting find. This is 2 doses of Paracetamol,  which is acetaminophen,  or Tylenol. Never seen this in a ration before. I did not take the doses due to age. \n\nPic 12 shows the nuts, again, nothing special here.\n\nPic 13 shows the crackers. These came in a clear sleeve like they were pulled from a larger box and just put inside. The lack of proper packaging did these in as they were so rancid and reeked accordingly.  I did try a small nibble, BLEH!\n\nPic 14 shows, hands down, one of the best ration components I have ever had in my life. This is a date. I believe these are Medjool dates given their size and deliciousness. Sweet, tender, and full of energy and fiber. An absolutely stunning addition. I wish there was a bag of 3 for each meal for sure! Beware of tooth breaker pits!\n\nPic 15 shows another fantastic component, a date bar. What a unique and delicious item! This has only 3 ingredients,  date puree, cocoa, and ground orange peel. I kid u not, you can literally taste every ingredient. The date is forward, then cocoa, then the orange peel on the back end. A fascinating and unexpected treat! Again, only one in the meal, so that was a bummer!\n\nPics 16 and 17 show breakfast. The olives and pickles tasted terrible. I could not eat them. I do not think they were bad, I just did not like them. The cup contains the dressing. It was kinda like salsa Verde I guess, but tasted off. Did not eat this as a result. The tortillas came in a pack of 6 and had a sort of cheesy aroma. These were not like usual tortillas,  dryer, and more crumbly. Can\'t say they tasted bad, just not great. That bowl of what was labeled as \"fowl\" is more akin to Mexican refried beans, but think way smoother and way more bland. I added crushed red to this to help it down. Tortillas were torn up and just used to scoop up this baby food. Worst meal of the 3.\n\nPic 18 shows the beans in sauce over the white rice. Again, just so bland and lacking texture. It didn\'t taste bad for sure, but was hard to get down nonetheless.  Again, crushed red pepper was added along with some Chipotle Tobasco. That helped.\n\nPic 19 shows the namesake on the ration packaging, the Ouzi Rice with Ouzi Lamb sauce. This was the best meal of the 3. Well seasoned and not nearly as bland. There were literally onky 3 small chunks of lamb though, which was disappointing as it was quite tender and a welcome addition to this, so far, vegitarian ration. \n\nAll in all, not an example of wonderfully crafted ration dining IMHO, but a wonderful experience nonetheless!

I\'m not sure about her exact weight/height but she looked like a beach ball, being as wide as she was tall. Aside from that, she was pretty nice to me and seemed to truly like being around me, that made me feel glad because someone finally given me a chance and actually stuck around. \n\nNow, where does the title come in? I had made plans with said friend to go play at her house after school one day, the plan was simple, after school we would go to my house so I could leave my school stuff behind and then I would change and she would guide me to her house. \n\nThat day the cafeteria food was the usual: rice, cooked beans and some meat, she ate (I know this beacuse I ran onto her eating while on my way to drink water.) I preferred to eat at home so I skipped the school lunch.\n\nAt my house, we greeted my mom and she made scrambled eggs for lunch, to my surprise when my mom offered her some she eagerly accepted. I was a bit confused since I was sure she had already eaten lunch, but I assumed she accepted out of politeness since it was the first time she came to my place.\n\nAfter we ate and left, on the way to her house we started talking, I talked about my mom teaching me how to cook and how I never got the amount of salt right. She interrupted me, and told me - very seriously - that I was NOT to tell her family that had already eaten lunch, she told me this in a stern tone, completely different from how she was talking earlier, I was taken aback but agreed.\n\nHer house was very nice, her family were lovely people, as soon as we arrived her older sister told us that their mom had cooked lunch and asked if we wanted some. I politely rejected, saying I had ealready eaten, friend, on the other hand, made her way to the kitchen and came back with a full plate.\n\nThe lunch at school is less than 1 hour before dismissal, my house was a 15 minute walk from the school itself, her house was around 25 minutes from mine by walking. So, if my math in correct, she ate three meals in less than 3 hours, mind you: in my country we eat rice with both lunch and dinner, so she ate three plates with cooked rice paired with either beans, meat or eggs.\n\nBy this point I was flabbergasted, I seriously couldn\'t find a rational explanation as to why she didn\'t seem sick or hadn\'t vomited half of the contents from her stomach yet.\n\nRest of the visit was uneventful, I actually had lots of fun with her and her family. We eventually lost contact as highschool came around.\n\nI honestly had never thought about this friend\'s eating habits, I just assumed she had a rounder body shape and a crappy metabolism because I never saw how much she ate, after that day did I finaly understood why she reached that size in the first place.\n\nTL;DR: Decided to spend a day with fat friend, witness her eating three entire lunches.

(84, 'reddit', '1onpnx1', 'Day 31: Pumpkin Quiche with Caramelized Onions', 'Finally the last post of 31 Days of Pumpkin! Only a few days late and a few dollars short (but you\'re not my landlord so who cares). Full list with links to the last 30 days of pumpkin recipes below. Let me know if you have a favorite, if you tried any of these.\n\nThis one is my personal favorite, it is more elaborate to make but it\'s delicious, and perfect for bringing to holiday gatherings to impress people without spending a ton of money. I got the idea from [French Country Home Magazine](https://myfrenchcountryhomemagazine.com/recipe-pumpkin-quiche/) based on a French pumpkin quiche from Benedictine nuns, unfortunately not a vegan recipe. Initially I tried using mung beans and couldn\'t get the texture right, so I switched to [Minimalist Baker\'s Simple Tofu Quiche recipe.](https://minimalistbaker.com/simple-tofu-quiche)\n\n**Crust Ingredients**\n\n* 1 and 1/2 cups flour (all purpose or other)\n* 1/2 cup  oil (Earth Balance or canola oil)\n* cold water sufficient to mix dough\n* storebought crust is fine too!\n\n**Filling Ingredients**\n\n* 1 package 14oz firm tofu\n* 1/2 cup pumpkin puree\n* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* one large white onion, sliced\n* balsamic vinegar OR soy sauce, optional (to caramelize the onion)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Start by caramelizing the onion. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Slice the onion into strips, saute in hot oil until brown, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of either soy sauce OR balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan, or water if you don\'t have those. This is purely optional but it does add a lot of flavor.\n\n2. Preheat your oven to 375F. Make the crust: mix flour and oil in a bowl until crumbly. Slowly add cold water while mixing, just until the dough pulls together. Knead a few times, then press into the bottom of a 9 inch pie plate. Prebake for 15 minutes while you make the filling.\nOr prepare your storebought crust (most are vegan just check the ingredients).\n\n3. Make the filling: to a blender or food processor add drained tofu, pumpkin, nutritional yeast, and salt. Run the food processor on high until the filling is silky smooth. You may have to scrape down the sides a few times, it will be very stiff. Set aside.\n\n4. Assemble the quiche: put 3/4 of the caramelized onions into the bottom of your pie crust. Spread the filling over the top, press it in and smooth down the top. Arrange the last 1/4 of onions on top of the quiche.\n\n5. Bake the quiche at 375 F (190 C) for 30–40 minutes or until the top appears golden brown and firm. If the crust begins to get too brown, loosely tent the edges with foil. Let cool before serving.\n\n\n**31 Days of Pumpkin Recipes**\n\n* [Day 1: Pumpkin Pie Smoothie](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/m79v37fO9A)\n\n* [Day 2: Pumpkin Falafel](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/P2cdrjAv7E)\n\n* [Day 3: Pumpkin Mac and Cheese](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/nNYesZ5AVG)\n\n* [Day 4: Pumpkin Cornbread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/yevIRCMnta)\n\n* [Day 5: Pumpkin Overnight Oats (2 Ways)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/LhPEAWMDrK)\n\n* [Day 6: Pumpkin Soup with Walnuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/vAQS9ugFCI)\n\n* [Day 7: Pumpkin Curry](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/H3y9gxaT6Nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/H3y9gxaT6N)\n\n* [Day 8: Pumpkin White Bean Burgers](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/BiQj2Jvn1t)\n\n* [Day 9: Pumpkin Chickpea Cauliflower Casserole](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/Do2Eki9mcFhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/Do2Eki9mcF)\n\n* [Day 10: Pumpkin Hummus](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/9CSXL7UlZK)\n\n* [Day 11: Pumpkin Black Bean Tacos](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/qRprdTD2kd)\n\n* [Day 12: Pumpkin Herb Biscuits](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/j5PYKwK15A)\n\n* [Day 13: Creamy Pumpkin Pasta with Edamame](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/fbbcFoBzmC)\n\n* [Day 14: Pumpkin Baked Rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/HhWu9EYmK4)\n\n* [Day 15: Pumpkin Vinaigrette](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/30fgH7MOAn)\n\n* [Day 16: Pumpkin White Bean Stew](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/inpVaNJ7KX)\n\n* [Day 17: Pumpkin Stuffed Shells with Garlic Bechamel Sauce](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/Vuew9LvDlz)\n\n* [Day 18: Pumpkin Baked Oatmeal with Tofu Mascarpone]( https://makeitdairyfree.com/one-bowl-vegan-pumpkin-baked-oatmeal/\n\n* [Day 19: Pumpkin Potato Quesadillas with Autumn Veggies](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/rkVquW8Qme)\n\n* [Day 20: Pumpkin Empanadas from Decolonize Your Diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/DdXQPgZSB3)\n\n* [Day 21: Pumpkin Cashew Cheesecake Cups](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/pXxGbTLvMW)\n\n* [Day 22: Pumpkin Samosas](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/97ZFf4dRCj)\n\n* [Day 23: Pumpkin mashed potatoes with greens and tempeh](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/oCTcpFts42)\n\n* [Day 24: Pumpkin Pizza Sauce](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/nUcx9kOISa)\n\n* [Day 25: Pumpkin Chili](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/yC2PMLhIyj)\n\n* [Day 26: Pumpkin Tamales](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/V7FQzReMRL)\n\n* [Day 27: Pumpkin Baked Ziti from The Veganomicon](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/lVIdlOckKK)\n\n* [Day 28: Pumpkin Barley Risotto](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/qVDz1DcIEg)\n\n* [Day 29: Pumpkin Marry Me Seitan](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/afTdtNHyU6)\n\n* [Day 30: Pumpkin Lasagna Soup](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/s/yXWKYnuXOI)\n\n*Day 31: Pumpkin Quiche with Caramelized Onions', 'cheapandbrittle', 'EatCheapAndVegan', 'https://reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/comments/1onpnx1/day_31_pumpkin_quiche_with_caramelized_onions/', 123, 8, '2025-11-04 05:08:12', '2025-11-07 23:40:42'),

(86, 'reddit', '1ojnxo9', 'Some rice ideas', 'Here are some meat and rice ideas:\n\n**Jambalaya:**  \nChicken thighs (as much or little as you can afford), seasoned with cajun or creole seasoning and browned, andouille sausage (if you can afford it), diced onion, bell pepper and celery, minced garlic, rice and water. \n\nYou can also add mushrooms if you like, or replace some of the water with canned crushed tomatoes. \n\n**Mexican Chicken and Rice:**  \nThere\'s really no *right* way to make this one. One of the easier ways is to season chicken hind quarters with either Adobo seasoning, or salt, pepper and garlic powder, and brown them in a little oil. Set those aside, then add a diced yellow or white onion (or whatever you have), saute until translucent, add minced garlic, then add rice once fragrant, and cook until it\'s barely golden brown. At this point you can add tomato paste or tomato sauce, or just water, then add 1/2 chicken bouillon cube, a sprinkle of cumin, and a little bit of mexican oregano (if you have it). Lay the chicken back on top, cover and simmer until the rice and chicken are both cooked through. \n\nServe with pinto beans: 12 oz pinto beans, 2 garlic cloves, 4 oz diced bacon (if you can afford it) and 2T Adobo seasoning. All items can go in a crockpot on low, with 3.5c water for 6ish hours, stirring every hour and adding water if necessary. You can then refry the beans or add water as necessary to get your desired consistency. \n\nTortillas are also easy to make, especially if you buy the mix. You can press corn tortillas in a zip lock bag using a plate or pan, and flour tortillas need to be rolled. There is a bit of a learning curve, and they take a bit to make a batch, but they\'re cheaper and better made at home.\n\n**\"Spanish Rice\":**  \nMy dad made this growing up. Brown ground beef, diced onion and diced bell pepper. Add minced garlic, then add tomato sauce, rice (he used minute rice, but I don\'t) and water (according to the volume of rice), cover and simmer. Season with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, and a sprinkle of cumin. You can stretch a bit of ground beef quite a bit with this one. \n\n**Perloo:**  \nA low country dish. Start with the same chicken &amp; vegetables as for jambalaya, but swap the andouille for a smoked sausage (or skip), and add mushrooms, and just use salt, pepper and garlic powder (in lieu of cajun/creole seasoning). Everyone\'s recipe is a little bit different, so play around and get what you want. \n\n**Biryani:**  \nAnother meat and rice dish. Marinate diced chicken (breasts, thighs or whatever you want) with a little bit of yogurt, garlic and ginger paste and Indian spices (you can generally buy a pre-made mix pretty cheaply at most stores). Let marinate for 30 minutes, then add to a pot with oil. \n\nMeanwhile, rinse your basmati rice. Once the chicken is mostly cooked, throw the rice in the pot with water, garam masala and more of the spice mix. Cover and cook until the rice and chicken are done. \n\nIs this \"proper\" biryani? No. But it\'s an easy and inexpensive way to change up your chicken and rice. \n\n**Chicken fried rice:**  \nUse day-old leftover rice. Doce your chicken, onion, carrot, green onions and any other vegetables you may be using. Stir-fry on HIGH heat with a little bit of oil (very little!), and set aside as you finish each ingredient. Then add your eggs (if you can), scramble quickly, and immediately add the rice. Smash the rice and stir it around to coat it all with egg and so it fries and heats evenly. It is VERY important to use day-old, cold rice. Add the chicken and vegetables back, and season with a splash of Chinese light soy sauce and oyster sauce. \n\nAlternatively, you can use pork, beef, shrimp or whatever other meat you want or have available. You can also use Japanese soy sauce if you\'d like to change it up a bit - it\'s not a huge difference, but it\'s noticeable. \n\n**Spaghetti:**  \nI know this is on everyone\'s list BUT don\'t be afraid to change it! Start by sauteeing diced onion, carrot and celery, then add minced garlic and finally your meat, if using. You can use 50/50 pork and beef if you like (1# is 3.98 at Walmart, I believe), or skip the meat altogether if you\'d like. You can use 1# of meat for 2 jars/cans of sauce and 2# of pasta if you need to stretch it. Finish with a little olive oil and parsley if you can, or just skip those and enjoy as is. \n\n**Beef Keema:**  \nBrown 1lb ground beef and one diced red onion. Add in a minced garlic clove or two, then garlic, onion and coriander powder, ground cardamom, chili powder, paprika, a sprinkle (or more) of cayenne powder and salt. Cook that down for a couple minutes, then add in 3 diced roma tomatoes (large chunks is fine), and some water to make a sauce. Cover and cook 5-10 minutes, then finish with garam masala and serve over basmati rice. It\'s even better if you throw some frozen peas in, but you don\'t have to. You can also make this with potatoes if you can\'t afford ground beef. \n\n**Ethiopian chicken stew:**  \nOnce again,  this isn\'t a perfect adaptation, but an attempt at making something different (and delicious!) while on a budget. \n\nStart by slowly cooking down 2-3 diced red onions in butter. Once softened, add a few minced garlic cloves, then 3T berebere seasoning (you can buy this at a lot of African markets, even if not specifically Ethiopian, or online from Savory Spice).\n\nWhile the onions are cooking, remove the skin from a whole chicken and portion it into pieces. It would traditionally be rubbed with a little bit of lemon juice, then slits are cut into the meat to help the sauce penetrate the meat and so it cooks quicker. (You do not have to use the whole chicken, or you can use just thighs, or leg quarters, or whatever you prefer).\n\nOnce the onions and garlic are cooked, add the chicken to the pot and mix with the onions, then add a little bit of water to create a little bit of a sauce (not traditional, but I usually do). Cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through. At this point, you can add a few hard-boiled eggs, with holes poked in them with a knife or a fork (to allow the sauce to penetrate a little bit), and toss them into the stew to heat through. \n\nThis would normally be served with injera, a fermented flatbread made from teff flour, but I normally just serve with steamed rice (usually basmati, but whatever you have is fine).\n\nThis one sounds a bit more intimidating, but don\'t be afraid to try it! It will take 90 minutes to make, maybe a little more, but it\'s worth the effort. \n\n\n\nI regularly make all of these, and I know they\'re not all authentic, but they\'re great ways of eating chicken and rice without it being the same thing over and over, and most of them can be made for under $10/4 servings, depending on how much meat you use, but you can cut the meat back quite a bit as needed. The key is really in the spices, so be sure to give them a try!\n\n**Bonus - Tacos Dorados:**  \nNot chicken and rice!\n\nBoil and mash potatoes, then season with cumin, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper. \n\nSaute diced white onion and a jalapeno (or 10, whatever your preference is), and then mix into the seasoned potatoes.\n\nIn a skillet full of oil, fry corn tortillas, folding them into a hardshell taco shape, until crispy and golden. Drain on a wire rack, or on paper towels. \n\nFill the taco shells with the potato mixture, then top with diced tomato and white onion. \n\nServe with red rice and beans (recipes under \"Mexican chicken and rice\" - just skip the chicken part for the rice).\n\n\nEnjoy!\n', 'Chocko23', 'budgetfood', 'https://reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1ojnxo9/some_rice_ideas/', 62, 14, '2025-10-30 08:20:33', '2025-11-07 23:40:42'),
(87, 'reddit', '1o56s6b', 'I\'ve been vegan for 7+ years and I sometimes I want to give up.', 'By give up I don\'t really mean go back to eating animals foods. I\'m completely grossed out by even the thought of eating animal flesh again and specially the by products.... I just want to stop caring or rather I want to stop being disappointed. people have already stop caring about their morals. It\'s obvious the Internet and social media have completely rotten everyone\'s morals... The way people describe animals food completely disgust me. Even the way people justify evil just because the person \"deserved\" it. I almost feel like I can\'t wait for my time to come when I can finally rest from this cruel world. maybe it\'s because I have never met another sane person. Even the vegans I met were off the rails and not someone I wanted to be associated with. I met a few non vegans that were tiptoeing into plant based because they \"aren\'t that into eating meat\". However, I told them good luck and that it\'s going to take more than not being into meat to stay vegan or plant based.\n\n\nI think I\'ve become cynical and have no cure. My new friends genuinely try their best to accommodate my lifestyle and will eat plant based to hang out with me and I feel terrible that I keep telling them I don\'t really care I can always something to eat in any restaurant except for meat only ones. After so much persistence I decided to go with them to a few vegan restaurants that I loved only to learn that they completely closed... It\'s been a shocking realization seeing my favorite restaurant close.. the only ones that stayed are onces that are mixed and extremely over priced ones for something as simple as rice and beans with tofu.. why? There\'s only one local vegan restaurant and I try my best to continue eating there so it doesn\'t die. But I was heartbroken when the owner told me they raise the rent and they even charge more for parking. The owner told me they might have no other choice but to go back to their home country as life here is way too expensive. It was so sad to hear. All I hear people talk about now is protein, protein, carbs, protein it\'s so sickening... It\'s like corporations have reduce foods to micros and people have abandoned their morals for fame, convenience and money...I guess that\'s normal.

(89, 'reddit', '1oqjitx', 'WIBTA if I showed the places my dad sings at his racist and homophobic posts from online', 'Throw away for obvious reasons \n\nI (26M) know I am most likely be doing this for petty reasons. My dad (63) has always been awful towards me and my siblings. He used to beat us when we would get questions wrong on our homework, take money from us from birthdays and holidays that other relatives gave us because \"it\'s the dad tax\".  He also would always tell us about how much happier he\'d be if he never had us/adopted us (one of my sisters that I\'ll call S (30) is his biological child/is white and me and my brother that I\'ll call A (19) are adopted from China but are not biologically related to each other). He says that he\'d have so much more money and peace if he didn\'t have to have children.\n\nI also know deep down he is depressed and had taken it out on us. His mom died before S could meet her of cancer. His dad was a alcoholic that got worse after his mom died and ended up passing away soon after. He had to move for job opportunities to the East Coast and ended up leaving right before 2 of his brothers died in a car accident. I know he\'s had his hardships and even though it doesn\'t excuse his actions, these are things that irreversibly changes who someone is.\n\n\nHe started singing at our church and did unpaid gigs for people in our community. He doesn\'t sing for the money but people in our church have spread word of mouth that he\'s pretty good at singing and the piano so hell sometimes  do free entertainment (plus tips) since he just likes to do it.  Its just 2 or 3 places he goes to and it\'s typically just once a month at least. Hell stay out even after to have dinner at the place if his set is earlier to chat with people there as well. So the gigs aren\'t about the money, it\'s about the music and the people.\n\nI recently found out that one of the places is now owned by the previous owners nephew, K who is married to P, a immigrant woman from india. I\'ve met her in person and she\'s incredibly kind and loving. I have nothing but good things to say about her.  They love my dad and have nothing but good things to say about him. He volunteered his time to help them change out a few things around the restaurant (like bringing in new furniture and stuff like that). \n\nRecently, my dad has been losing his mind over Mumdani in NYC. He\'s been posting on facebook about how he thinks Mumdani is a terrorist coming in to change the country into a socialist landscape. It\'s one thing if he posts nonsense stuff online but recently it\'s been derailing into things I find incredibly disturbing. He describes how he knows from God that Mumdani is pretending to be the man he is because he just wants to r*pe multiple virgin girls once he dies and how could anyone vote for a man like that who is forcing his religion into the government. He is also making AI photos of Mumdani as a trans woman and of him crying and eating rice with his hands. Also that he cannot believe all of New York City forgot about 9/11. That he hopes Mumdani causes the next 9/11 so people don\'t make the same mistakes of this generation.  This is just a few examples. He constantly puts his face (I think through AI) onto effemiente gay men and talk about how imagine these men in the future looking like him. And how no one will be gay because if gay men weren\'t so narcissistic that they wouldnt be gay. I don\'t understand the logic on any of what he posts. \n\nI feel like I should reach out and let the owners know because they\'re genuinely very close with him. I know this is a decision that\'ll change how a entire community sees him. I don\'t know if I should let the other places he goes to sing at this as well since I\'m not sure if it\'s my place to. I don\'t feel good just sitting on this and not saying anything. Hes a man with a lot of complex issues and is most likely just becoming delirious with time but I also feel as a person of color to let my community know what\'s happening. My older sister says I need to do what I want while my brother doesn\'t really care because he\'s concerned with college classes. \n\nSorry this is so long and rambly. I feel like I\'m losing my mind but it doesn\'t feel right to tell one place and not tell the others. I don\'t think he\'s actually dangerous but I want to let these places know the company they keep. Thanks for the advice in advance. \n\n', 'Successful-Trash-918', 'AITAH', 'https://reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oqjitx/wibta_if_i_showed_the_places_my_dad_sings_at_his/', 2, 17, '2025-11-07 10:15:01', '2025-11-07 23:40:42'),

(92, 'reddit', '1oduxq2', 'An important part of spirituality that many people are forgetting', 'Spirituality means oneness with everything else in the universe and learning to love all who share our world - not just fellow humans but all of creation - nature, animals and plants. \n\nWhen you love those outside of yourself, you feel their pain as your own.\n\nWhy is Jesus considered a spiritual master? Because he cared so much for those who were suffering that he was willing to sacrifice himself to help them. So if anyone reading this wants to grow spiritually, the question to be asking yourself is - how can I help those who are suffering? \n\nAnd as much as humans are suffering right now in these dark times, there can be no denying that there is no suffering greater than that of the animals that share this planet with us. \n\nAlmost one hundred billion animals a year are bred to be exploited for eggs, milk and meat. Hens spend all their lives imprisoned in filthy cages so tiny they can’t even spread their wings. Billions of male chicks a year are thrown into a grinder and crushed to death simply because they can’t lay eggs and turn a profit for egg farmers. Female cows are repeatedly artificially inseminated so that when their babies are born, their milk can be sold to consumers and their babies sold for veal and leather. They are milked constantly until their udders swell from infection and they collapse from illness and exhaustion. Sows are repeatedly artificially inseminated and imprisoned in painfully narrow crates, and forced to lie in their filth all day. Their babies are taken away and slaughtered at just a few weeks old. The only time in their lives they will see the sky is when they are looking out of the truck that’s taking them to slaughter. As you are reading this, millions of animals around the world right now  are being dragged, frightened and helpless, into the slaughterhouses where they will be bludgeoned and stabbed mercilessly, and crying and screaming in agony as they bleed to death. \n\nPlease also think of fish and other marine animals - trillions of animals being harvested a year by the seafood industry. The oceans are on the brink of collapse. Dolphins, seals and sharks are struggling to survive because humans are taking all their food. Countless dolphins, turtles and seabirds a year being trapped and killed by the fishing nets. \n\nNot to mention the wild animals like elephants, forest birds and monkeys that are losing their homes because of all the forests that need to be destroyed every year in order to grow the billions of tonnes of crops needed to feed the 100 billion livestock. If we stopped breeding animals for food, we would need to grow far less crops for our consumption and we could return these forests back to Nature. We could even have enough food to feed the starving children in impoverished countries. \n\nIf the suffering of all the animals was an energy that could be harnessed, their suffering would be an earthquake that would crumble earth\'s  very foundations. It would be a fire that would consume everything in existence. It would be a tsunami that would flood the entire planet. \n\nWe are not like lions and tigers who need to eat other animals to survive. We can thrive on plants. A simple search on the internet will show you a long list of well-known people who have been vegan for decades. Vegetables, lentils and rice are not more expensive than meat, milk and eggs. And if you believe that plants feel pain, we actually save more plants by not breeding animals for food because we wouldn’t need to kill so many plants to feed the livestock. \n\nAnimals are suffering not because of the farmers or the corporations. Animals are suffering because of the demand for meat, milk and eggs that is keeping the corporation and farmers in business. \n\nBy making kinder choices in our daily lives, we can save billions of animals a year from being born into a lifetime of misery and suffering. We can save the forests and the oceans and the wild animals. We really don’t have to be a species that exploits and kills trillions of animals a year. The human species can only evolve spiritually when we learn to show compassion to all animals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'vegan_pixie', 'spirituality', 'https://reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1oduxq2/an_important_part_of_spirituality_that_many/', 7, 15, '2025-10-23 11:23:23', '2025-11-07 23:40:42'),
(93, 'reddit', '1oqo8ly', '12 night Cruising Japan (Celebrity Millenium) — October 2025 — Pros, Cons &amp; Tips', 'Writing this post, as it may be useful for future travelers on this cruise as Japan is becoming a popular destination.  \n  \n**TL;DR:** Comfortable ship and painless logistics, but limited time in Japan and little local food. Best for cruise fans or travelers who don’t want to navigate trains; not the ideal way to *experience* Japan. 12 nights is in reality only 6 different japanese stops. \n\n# Pros\n\n* **Fast embarkation/disembarkation:** Queues were short if you got off right at clearance. The longest line was returning to Japan in **Hakodate** after South Korea.\n* **Refit ship:** Public spaces felt fresh and well kept. The ship was fully booked but it was never overly crowded like Disneyland. \n* **Quiet cabins:** Excellent sound insulation. In the front of the ship, it was a bit rocky, try to pick the middle if you can. \n* **Low stress if you miss a stop:** Except **Kochi** and **Busan**, you’re usually just a train ride from the next port.\n\n# Cons\n\n* **Mandatory foreign-port call + sea days:** Because the ship isn’t Japan-flagged, there’s a required foreign stop—hence **Busan, South Korea**—plus three sea days. On a “12-night Japan” route you effectively get **six** different Japanese ports (not counting Yokohama embark/debark).\n* **Limited immersion:** With only \\~7 days actually in Japan and U.S.-style dinners onboard, it’s hard to get a feel for the country without adding land days. We added **10** and that’s when the real experience started.\n* **Onboard food:** American. Quality: fine but unspecial.\n* **Early sail-aways:** Except **Osaka** and **Hakodate**, departures before dinner mean you’ll mostly eat local **lunch**, not dinner.\n* The Busan stop is waste of time on a Japan cruise. It\'s very different from Japan.  \n\n# Is it “worth it”?\n\nGreat for cruise die-hards or travelers who prefer not to manage trains/luggage. If your goal is deep cultural/culinary Japan, an independent land itinerary (or land add-on) beats a cruise.\n\n# Tips that made a difference\n\n* **Save room for lunch:** Do a light/late breakfast onboard and eat local specialties in port.\n* **Skip ship tours for an early start:** Independent travelers can usually disembark earlier than tour groups due to clearence often happening 30mins before the expected arrival time; we consistently beat ship tours to the sights by **an hour** by jumping straight into a taxi.\n* **Arrival day (Yokohama):** Check in, drop bags, then go back out to explore Yokohama luggage-free.\n* **DIY works:** We booked **zero** ship tours. Taxis + public transport covered everything with less dead time.\n* **Hiroshima museum:** Go **first thing in the morning**. Our afternoon visit had a \\~30-minute queue just to enter the main exhibit.\n* **Buying knives:** If you purchase a Japanese knife, security will hold it and return it at the end of the cruise. Kochi is a good stop for quality knives.\n* **Transit:** Add a **Suica** card to Apple Wallet **before** you arrive; it works for most trains, subways, and buses.\n* **Tipping:** Don’t. Pay what’s on the bill—leaving extra can be insulting for staff.\n* **Learn a few words:** Hello\' / \'Good evening\' and \'Thank you\' in Japanese. They appreciate it much more when you start the conversation and attempt to speak their language even if you obviously can\'t say more than a word.\n* **Hakodate lunch:** **Uni Murakami** (a few mins from the port) for a proper sea urchin rice bow, legit, not a tourist trap.\n* **Taxis:** In Japan, Uber typically dispatches regular metered taxis, so pricing is similar—just hop in a taxi at the port. In **Busan**, to avoid potential overcharging, use official taxi stands or a reputable ride-hailing app and insist on the meter.', 'anthelios123', 'celebritycruises', 'https://reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1oqo8ly/12_night_cruising_japan_celebrity_millenium/', 11, 11, '2025-11-07 14:38:54', '2025-11-07 23:40:42'),

(96, 'reddit', '1oizblj', 'AITAH for giving my girlfriend\'s sister a gift?', 'My girlfriend\'s (F27) sister (F24) have been living in the same house as me since June. My girlfriend told me, before her sister moved in, that she can be quite a b\\*\\*\\*\\* sometimes and how her sister, despite being a grown woman, still acts like she\'s 14. I didn\'t think much of it as I thought this was just some sibling beef they had between them when they were growing up. My gf also told me about how her sister (let\'s call her Tori) always talked about how she despised her father and thought he was stupid because he is the man of the house and he should be doing all the chores and cook all the food instead of her mother (this becomes relevant later in the story). Once again, I thought it was just unresolved family drama so I brushed it off.\n\nDespite the sibling drama, I told my gf to let Tori stay in our house as if she didn\'t she would have to live 2-3hrs away from the city and how she would at least have people to take care of her if she was sick or if anything happened to her, to which my gf agreed. Tori, my gf and I mostly got along well. We\'d cook for each other, watch movies and laugh together and even go shopping together and have dinners together, that was until recently...\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. Tori started showing some of the behaviours my gf had warned me about. She would leave her socks in the garage, she would come home and leave her dishes in the sink and not wash the dishes, despite us having the agreement to take turns. Even when we kindly reminded her, she would forget or do what we told her to do but repeat the same thing the next day.\n\nA few days ago, Tori had accidentally cooked a batch of rice when we already had a batch of rice in the fridge and since Tori and my gf eat very little, it meant the rice would go to waste. I told my gf to remind Tori of not only the rice, but also the taking turn of washing dishes and about the socks situation as we were about to leave to the gym and as my gf and Tori finished talking (they were standing where the garage door was), I heard a loud slam. I asked my gf if it was Tori who slammed the door or if it was the wind and my gf said she was thinking the same thing and couldn\'t tell.  \n  \nWe went out to the shopping mall and since Tori\'s birthday was a week ago, we decided to buy her a bag as we thought the restaurants we took her out to on her birthday week was not enough. We got her a clutch bag and wanted to surprise her when we went home.  \n  \nThis is where things get a bit complicated...I told my gf we should surprise Tori by giving her the bag while she was in the room. Tori usually sleeps really early as she works early in the morning but we noticed we had a few mins left before her actual bedtime so we knocked on the door to give her the gift. I think Tori was already asleep but when we knocked a second time, we heard her voice. Now I don\'t understand the language they spoke (they are both from overseas) but I think Tori was thinking that we would scold her or tell her off because she sounded like she wanted us to leave, but I insisted on telling my gf to open the door to surprise her with the gift. I stood outside as it\'d be quite weird if I went into Tori\'s room so my gf went in.  \n  \nFrom what I remember, it sounded like my gf was gonna scold her, then surprised her with the gift, then it was 10 mins of silence and then it was lots and lots of crying. I don\'t know what happened but it didn\'t sound very good.  \n  \nMy gf came out in tears and when we went to the gym afterwards, she told me Tori had a migraine. She also told me that their mom had scolded Tori for being so bratty about the chores and I think a combination of both made her snap in her room.\n\nMy gf and I spent the next three days at my parents place and when I came back, Tori gave me the silent treatment. Before I left to my parents house, I asked Tori if she wanted meds or food as she had a bad migraine, but she didn\'t reply or pick up my calls despite reading my message. I also asked her if she wanted me to bring food for her from my parents house and she replied with a sharp \"No\" on insta.\n\nWhen I finally went home, she would avoid talking to us and when I asked her if she wanted anything from Costco, she replied with an angry \"NO\" to me. Now at first, I thought she was still angry at everyone for what had happened but that night, I noticed Tori and my gf talking normally about buying furniture for their house in their home country so I feel like I was the one that made her mad.\n\nHere\'s the kicker, my gf\'s mom called my gf and spilled the tea. Apparently Tori was speaking to MY sister (21F) and my sister told Tori about how I was the most loved child in the family and how I was always No.1. This (somehow) made Tori think that I was jealous of her for being closer with my gf than I was because she is my gf\'s sister. Additionally, apparently according to my gf\'s mom, she thinks I was the one who told my gf to yell at her in her room.\n\nNumber 1, I just wanted my gf to give her the gift, say \"SURPRISE\" and then leave. Number 2, I don\'t really get the jealousy thing. Number 3, I lowkey feel like she only got angry because we were telling her to do the chores and she kinda expected me to do it all like her dad. Number 4, despite all that was said, I feel like I was also in the wrong and I feel like, if we had just left her gift in front of her room or on the counter, things would have turned out differently.

(98, 'reddit', '1onbk9h', 'Russian Citizens have begun to actively save on food', 'AI summary:\n\n* **Demand collapse**: Grocery purchases slowed from 6% growth to 3.5%; basic products down 5-10% in Sept-Oct\n* **Profit squeeze**: Retailer margins falling to historic low of 1.7-1.9% (from 2.3%) due to rising costs and price controls\n* **Trading down**: Consumers abandoning premium products; food package sizes down 3% (shrinkflation/skimpflation)\n* **Format shift**: Supermarkets/hypermarkets down 1.4%; shift to discounters and stores under 700 sq meters\n\n\n\nThe period of active growth in consumer demand for food products has been replaced by a cooling of the market. In January–September, the number of purchases in grocery stores grew by only 3.5%, although at the beginning of the year the figure was 6%. In September–October, there was a decline in demand for basic products. This is affecting retailers\' results: even discounters are seeing slower growth rates. Retail profitability may fall to a historic low, and relationships between chains and suppliers will become more complicated.\n\nA decline in consumer activity began to be observed in the everyday goods segment. In January–September, the number of consumer receipts in grocery stores increased by 3.5% year-on-year, according to calculations by the Check Index service of the OFD Platform company (fiscal data operator). Back in January-April, the growth rate was estimated at 6%. Evotor reports that in January-September, the number of purchases in general grocery stores remained at last year\'s level, while in specialty stores it grew by only 1.5%, and in butcher shops, for example, it fell by 7% year-on-year. Retail turnover is growing, but only due to higher prices and, accordingly, higher average receipts. According to the Check Index, in January-September, consumers spent an average of 1,100 rubles per trip to the grocery store, a 9% increase year-on-year.\n\nThis negative trend is likely to continue, with analysts already recording a decline in sales in basic product categories.\n\nAccording to Takskom (a fiscal data operator), in September-October, sales of basic food products in real terms fell by 5% year-on-year. For example, according to analysts, milk lost 8% during this period, buckwheat lost 9%, and rice lost 10%. T-Pay reports that in January-September, the number of purchases in supermarkets fell by 2% year-on-year.\n\nArtur Gafarov, head of the Institute for Entrepreneurship and Economic Development, believes that the year will end with a decline in demand. In his opinion, the upcoming pre-New Year sales period will not be able to smooth out this picture. Daria Ananyina, an analyst at Gazprombank\'s Economic Forecasting Center, believes that this year, physical retail turnover in Russia as a whole will grow by 1.8%. This is more than three times lower than last year\'s figure of 5.9%. In the next few years, according to the expert, the figure will increase by 0.5-1% per year.\n\n# Consumers are cutting back on spending\n\nLeonid Ardalionov, Director of Analytics at NTech, believes that food sales growth began to slow down in December last year: consumers began to abandon variety in favor of simpler and cheaper food. Prior to that, the trend had been the opposite. “In 2023–2024, many people had money that was redirected to the food market; food is a pleasure, while expensive cars and watches remained inaccessible to most,” he says.\n\nMr. Ardalionov considers the delicatessen category to be indicative, which analysts include products that consumers purchase for pleasure: cheese assortments, caviar, seafood, lightly salted fish, rolls, dry-cured sausages, etc. While in 2023–2024, the growth rate of real sales in this category exceeded the market average by 3.7 times, in January–May of this year, it was a third lower.\n\nThe expert notes that consumers are unlikely to have started eating less, but are rather taking a more rational approach to spending—they are not buying in excess, are looking for cheaper options, etc.\n\nThe Cherkizovo Group believes that sentiment during periods of crisis gradually worsens. First, people switch to more affordable channels and look for discounts, then they consider cheaper products and categories, and in the final stage, they are ready to give up certain products altogether. According to the company, consumers are currently still in the first stage of rationalization.\n\n# Chains are falling short on revenue\n\nThe slowdown in demand for food products is affecting the performance of key retailers. According to Infoline, in the first half of the year, the revenue of the ten largest FMCG chains amounted to 6.1 trillion rubles, an increase of 17.1% year-on-year. In the same period of 2024, growth was estimated at 24.7%. X5\'s revenue in the third quarter reached RUB 1.16 trillion, up 18.5% year-on-year. In the second quarter, growth was estimated at 21.6%.\n\nFor Chizhik, the fastest-growing chain within X5, July-September 2025 was the first reporting period since the beginning of 2021 when the chain\'s revenue did not increase compared to the previous quarter, Alfa Bank analysts noted in their report. Metro\'s sales in Russia increased by 4.9% year-on-year in the third quarter. In the second quarter, the growth rate was estimated at 6%. In the third quarter of 2024, the growth rate was 13%.\n\nX5 is seeing a general slowdown in food retail growth and trading down, with consumers moving from high-price segments to low-price segments. Stanislav Bogdanov, chairman of the presidium of the Association of Retail Companies, also speaks of a slowdown in retail growth, but doubts that there will be a drop in demand for essential goods. According to him, the profitability of retailers\' businesses is being squeezed by the difficult situation on the labor market, rising logistics costs, and other factors. Magnit, Lenta, Verny, Metro, and other major chains did not respond to Kommersant\'s questions.\n\nPSK-Resheniya analyst Emil Safarov expects the financial results of the largest retail players to “plateaus”: indicators will grow more slowly, but will not fall. However, Infoline does not rule out that the average net profit margin of the largest FMCG chains in 2025 may decline from last year\'s 2.3% to 1.7–1.9%. This would be a historic low. Olga Sumishevskaya, a partner at One Story, also notes a decline in the profitability of the retail business.\n\nAlexander Zaitsev, CEO of Atomic Capital, notes that price wars could have a negative impact on retailers: the battle for consumers is forcing chains to keep prices down even as costs rise.\n\nAccording to Mr. Gafarov, the slowdown in this context is only part of the problem. Due to government control of food prices, chains are unable to pass on rising costs to consumers, he explains. This distorts business models and leads to increased conflicts between chains and suppliers, who are also faced with the need to index prices.\n\nRetailers insist on compensation for lost profits from suppliers, additional discounts, etc., says Dmitry Leonov, deputy chairman of the board of the Rusprodsoyuz association (which brings together large food producers). This, he says, creates an additional burden on business. The Resource Association also reports a partial tightening of conditions on the part of retailers, linking this, among other things, to a decline in consumer activity.\n\n# The market is looking for formats\n\nImproved operational efficiency and flexible working relationships with suppliers could have a positive impact on network profitability, according to Andrey Sharov, an analyst at BCS World of Investments. He does not rule out that the situation for retailers will improve in 2026 due to slower cost growth and lower interest rates on loans.\n\nKirill Malyshev believes that retailers can optimize their model now by anticipating changes in consumer sentiment—for example, by developing private labels in categories where there is demand for cheaper goods. Emil Safarov notes that the share of revenue from such brands in chain revenues already exceeds 12% and continues to grow. Private labels allow retailers to control the cost of products and minimize marketing expenses for their promotion. The expert names ready-made meals as another segment that businesses are betting on in crisis conditions. It also allows them to control prices and is considered high-margin.\n\nHowever, according to Alexander Zaitsev, betting on profitable categories is unlikely to be a long-term solution: “The market is saturated, and competition in the ready-made food segment is growing.”\n\nThe expert considers improving operational efficiency to be a rational solution — automating warehouses, developing loyalty programs, reducing losses, etc.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Zaitsev believes it is important to look for new growth points. However, modernization and entry into new markets often involve additional costs that businesses are not prepared to bear due to the high cost of loans.\n\nRetailers are actively optimizing their store formats. According to Infoline, in January-September, the number of supermarkets and hypermarkets decreased by 1.4% year-on-year. Sixty-seven facilities with a total area of 185,200 square meters closed. The market is being reformatted in favor of discounters and neighborhood stores. Nikita Kornienko, CEO of the commercial real estate investment platform SimpleEstate, says that retailers are now mainly looking for premises of up to 700 square meters, while classic supermarkets start at 1,000 square meters. “The economics per square meter are better for small stores; they only stock the most profitable goods and require fewer staff,” he believes.\n\n# Manufacturers are revising their plans\n\nThe slowdown in demand for food products is a serious challenge for manufacturers, says Dmitry Leonov. According to him, businesses are now revising their development plans and looking for opportunities to stimulate sales by optimizing their product range or promoting new products. Freedom Finance Global notes that food production in Russia fell by 0.6% in January-September. Beverages showed a decline of 4.1%. Analysts attribute this to the high cost of loans and low prices for certain categories on the domestic market.\n\nAlla Andreeva, CEO of the Union of Juice, Water and Beverage Producers (Soyuznapitki), says that market participants are cautious about 2026. Non-alcoholic beverages are not considered essential goods, and demand for them can easily fall. According to Ms. Andreeva, businesses are now counting on a balanced policy from retail chains and support from the authorities.\n\nMeasures to maintain business profitability that are unpopular with consumers, such as reducing the standard package size while maintaining the price (shrinkflation), remain relevant. Leonid Ardalionov says that in the second quarter, the average weight of food packaging decreased by 3%. At the peak of the food market\'s growth in the third quarter of last year, shrinkflation was 1%. Artur Gafarov also notes that manufacturers are now forced to adjust the quality and quantity characteristics of their products.\n\nAlexandra Mertsalova, Alina Migacheva, Vladimir Komarov\n\n# Expert opinion\n\n“It is difficult for a significant part of the population to save money”\n\nEconomist Sergey Zaversky on the savings model of consumption\n\nSergey Zaversky, head of the analytical research department at the Institute for Comprehensive Strategic Studies, spoke to Kommersant about the reasons for the population\'s shift to a savings-based consumption model, the differences in approaches among income groups, and the emerging trend of skimpflation in the market.\n\n— We often hear that citizens have shifted to a savings model. What indicates this?\n\n— If the real disposable income of the population in the first half of 2025 grew by 7.8%, while retail trade turnover grew by only 2.1%. This trend continued in July and August. The slowdown in sales growth is even more significant for non-food products, and a number of product groups are showing a year-on-year decline in consumer spending. These include, for example, household appliances, furniture, construction and repair goods, clothing, and footwear. The amount of money citizens have in bank deposits is growing faster than interest rates on deposits, and there is still a net inflow of funds. But much depends on which income groups we are talking about. According to surveys, about 60% of Russians have no savings at all.\n\n— When do consumers usually start saving or spending more?\n\n— In recent years, major events such as currency fluctuations have often been the trigger. But this is not the only option. A striking example from recent years is the scrappage scheme, when we see a surge in demand amid expectations of an increase. Globally, there are two groups. The first is factors that favor consciously choosing savings over consumption at the moment. These include high interest rates on deposits and the attractiveness of long-term investments. The second group consists of factors that act as constraints on current consumption. For example, this could be the unavailability of credit, which is the flip side of high deposit rates. It could also be the unavailability of goods of the required quality, in particular due to import restrictions. There are also traditional factors that have a restraining effect on the willingness to save, such as high inflation expectations. These often spike in response to any major external events, as supply-side constraints are generally recognized by the public. In such situations, we see an increase in demand, sometimes sharp, for certain groups of goods.\n\n— What expenses do consumers cut back on first? Does this depend on social groups?\n\n— I would talk not about social groups, but about income groups. Low-income groups spend most of their money on basic necessities and food, while higher-income groups spend a large proportion on services, non-food items, education, and healthcare. When these groups decide to save money, their decisions differ greatly. If we take the lowest-income group, the bottom decile, more than 60% of their spending goes on food and housing services, and less than 3% on leisure and catering. The wealthiest segment of the population spends about a quarter of their income on food, about 30% on transport, and more than 11% on leisure and catering. The bottom decile has to switch to cheaper food products and postpone the replacement of basic non-food items, shoes, and clothing. The top decile has to postpone the purchase of a new car, home repairs, or adjust their vacation plans.\n\n— Food — is that the last thing consumers cut back on?\n\n— Yes, but there are some nuances. It is difficult for a significant part of the population to save on food; there is simply no margin for savings. When consumers are forced to economize, they are often willing to switch from higher-quality goods to lower-quality but cheaper ones, or they hope that prices will remain stable. Manufacturers take this into account. They often try to keep prices the same and change something in the composition. Everyone remembers the term “shrinkflation,” and now the word “skimpflation” is becoming more relevant, when more expensive ingredients are replaced with cheaper ones to keep prices the same.\n\n— In your opinion, which food categories are the most and least elastic in terms of demand?\n\n— There are two key factors. First, the availability of affordable substitute products. Second, the share of spending on goods in the budget. The more substitute products there are, the faster and easier it is for consumers to give up a particular item. One type of meat becomes more expensive, and people can switch to another. For example, from beef to pork or poultry. But there are medicines, basic clothing items, housing services, or goods that are simply difficult to replace, such as bread or gasoline.\n\n— Is consumers\' desire to save money a bad thing?\n\n\n\n— If we look at our recent economic history, we have experienced several shocks of various kinds. One of the key factors in the economic recovery after each of these shocks was consumer demand, which allowed these periods of potential crisis to be smoothed over and passed relatively painlessly. But now we are already seeing negative trends emerging — just look at the situation with production dynamics in civilian industries not related to the defense-industrial complex. And these trends will only intensify. Cooling the economy and reducing demand now in order to combat inflation could have a number of negative effects. Companies are now forced to abandon or postpone many investment projects. When demand begins to recover at some point, for example, against the backdrop of lower interest rates, supply will again be unable to respond. And this again poses high risks of inflation spiraling out of control.\n\n— What measures could help convince consumers to stop saving and start spending more?\n\n— First and foremost, it is the dynamics of household income. Although citizens may prefer to allocate additional funds to repaying previously taken loans. Expectations and consumer confidence are also important. Interest rate dynamics and increased access to credit in the event of a rate cut will also play a role. Among the potential effects is the realization of pent-up demand, which we are currently seeing. For example, in the purchase of residential real estate.\n\nInterview by Alina Migacheva\n\nSource: Kommersant [https://archive.is/3ahqm](https://archive.is/3ahqm)', 'Dizzy_Response1485', 'CollapseOfRussia', 'https://reddit.com/r/CollapseOfRussia/comments/1onbk9h/russian_citizens_have_begun_to_actively_save_on/', 57, 1, '2025-11-03 20:20:27', '2025-11-07 23:40:42'),

(102, 'reddit', '1op1dna', 'Out of all the beautiful things in Syria, it\'s hard to pick my highlights!', 'Finally! Syria. The country that I was hoping to visit for such a long time. Already was curious after the war effectively ended in 2018/2019 and tourism returned in the last years to over 2 million visitors per year.\n\nNow after the liberation it\'s much easier (&amp; more safe) to visit. So, I finally went on a short solo trip!\n\nI stayed only in hotels, but made sure to meet or talk with locals every day to better understand the country and people\'s lives.\n\nIt was already quite difficult to pick just 20 pictures to somehow capture the country and it\'s of course even more difficult to describe some highlights without making it too long.\n\nSo, let\'s stick to a five categories that stood out to me:\n\n**Old History**\n\nSyria\'s history blew me away. Damascus, the oldest capital of the world, seems to be especially stuck in time.  Simple spice shops in the souq that are over 200 years old. Hotels in incredible 500 year old buildings. Remnants of the silk road and roman times everywhere. With 2,000 year old columns baked into simple, more modern, buildings.\n\nIt all looks a bit like a fairytale with all the art, architecture and designs full of details: Small alleyways with old houses; antiques are sold everywhere; a shop with old telephones; one shop that even today just sells cassettes.\n\nAnd where else can you walk a street that is mentioned in the bible, visit a church built my the Apostel Paul and go to a Christian village where people still speak the language of Jesus?\n\n**Modern History**\n\nAs someone that spent months or years on end on the appropriate subreddit following the war, it was fascinating to see the places that I read about in a much darker context, fill again with life and laughter.\n\nIt\'s of course also very sad to see how beautiful Syria is today, while also realising how much more incredible it must have been in the past. That was especially apparent in Aleppo, where even most of the old town was destroyed by the war and the Turkey-Syria earthquake in 2023. Now things are being rebuilt, and beautiful restaurants and cafés open up again right next to rubble and bombed out houses.\n\nI was shown pictures and videos and heard stories about how people experienced the \"liberation\". I\'ve also visited the heart of the Syrian revolution: Idlib. Idlib is off the usual/popular tourist route and I initially hesitated to go, because what I read on blogs (written this year) made it all seem a little too complicated and even a bit scary: *\"They only accept Turkish Liria\", \"your Syrian SIM card won\'t work\", \"lot\'s of people with guns\"*. The city is also heavily dramatised in videos of travel youtubers that I guess love to increase their clicks.\n\nNone of it was true. It was clean. People were very friendly. Syrian pounds were accepted everywhere. My internet worked. Not more guns than elsewhere.\n\nYes, as this city was ruled by Islamists and cut off from the rest of Syria, it was of course the most conservative place. Even some problematic Sunni Islamist murals were still painted on walls. Uyghurs and Uzbeks visible everywhere that presumably came as fighters and now had restaurants and shops.\n\nYet, all now a normal city that is again a regular part of Syria. Even my critical female friend from Aleppo that I just me the first time the day before and brought along for a day-trip and who previously thought she will never visit this city in her life was very surprised and happy that she went, because she realised that things weren\'t as she previously believed.\n\nBeing from Germany I was amused to see a \"House of Döner\" that advertised their their signature dish with a print on the window that read: \"One bite, and you\'re in Berlin!\".\n\n**Food**\n\nGenerally my favourite food in the world is food in that area area (Turkey, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Syria, Lebanon). So no surprise that I absolutely loved the food in Syria and especially Aleppo.\n\nNo matter what I ate, it not only most of the time looked great, but tasted so good. My absolute favourite (&amp; now generally top 5 dish) was Kebab B’il Karaz - a dish with lamb meatballs, bread and a sauce made with cherries.\n\n**Life**\n\nLife for locals is still tough in Syria, with basic things like ATM withdrawls, electricity and water severely limited - and the economy extremely weak. Yet, Syrians are a happy and easygoing (even too easy going sometimes: they seem to ignore traffic and just walk and stand on the street).\n\nCelebrations that have the scale of a big street party (with costumes, dancers, DJs and professional lights) are organised for small events like the opening of a lawyer\'s office or a falafel shop. Of course much to the dissatisfaction of some neighbours that live in areas where they happen many times a year.\n\nIt was great to see that no matter who I talked with (Artist, Atheists, Christians, Muslims): people were happy about Assad being gone and even generally speak positively about the situation today. I was a bit surprised that this is the case. Some explained, that people scare each other through misleading information being spread in social media.\n\nAnd it\'s easy to be mislead there because in the years of war, people rarely left the path between home and school/university/work. Never visited other cities. Many still can\'t afford it. All info from social media, in war time where social media is a problematic as it can get.\n\nDespite the president having what Trump calls a “very strong past\" and many being worried about various social restriction being put in place, things didn\'t change much so far.\n\nLingerie and even spicy S&amp;M outfits are still displayed in shopping windows. Alcohol is being openly sold in shops and bars. The nightlife seems not much different to what I\'m used to at home. There are no new rules for what people can wear. Women wear skirts and crop tops. Churches and various holy places of other religions are busy.\n\nWhile I am not euphoric about the new leadership and fear a lot of the hope is misplaced, it\'s nice to see how people generally are hopeful.\n\n**People**\n\nOf course tourism is still recovering, so scams or aggressive sellers that are common in all the popular tourist countries luckily don\'t yet exist here.\n\nSyrian people are for sure some of the most welcoming, generous and nice people that I have so far come across. I had great conversations, people went out of their way to offer help, I was showered in gifts, got free food, extras and invitations for tea or to stay at people homes.\n\nSimilar to other southern countries like Italy: A lot of communication happens through hand movements and facial expressions. Foreign to me, but interesting to observe.\n\nIt\'s impressive how people laugh about and manage problems that affect daily life, that seems hard for many (including me) to even comprehend.\n\n ', 'SH_DY', 'travel', 'https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1op1dna/out_of_all_the_beautiful_things_in_syria_its_hard/', 16950, 478, '2025-11-05 19:22:31', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

Some of you might remember a post I made here months ago showing a fossil I found in a Texas creek — it was shared around quite a bit. I wanted to finally give an update and share what’s been going on with it.\n\nAfter thinking through all my options, I decided to donate the fossil to the paleontology department at SMU so it could be properly studied and preserved. They sent out a team to excavate everything they could. Turns out it was indeed a pliosaur and they are thinking the genus is Brachauchenius. The shale matrix it was in was pretty soft, so it wasn’t too hard to uncover, but it still took about two full days of careful work between several people.\n\nIt was incredible getting to watch and even help a little — seeing the process up close, from digging around the fossil to making plaster jackets and lifting the blocks out of the ground. They used everything from hammers and chisels to tiny porcupine quills for detail work. The specimen’s now in their lab, slowly being prepped and I will be posting updates as I get them. \n\nI still think about how crazy the odds had to be for the universe to align so perfectly for that fossil to have eroded out right in my lifetime after millions of years underground. The odds of me walking that exact stretch of creek at the exact right moment still blow my mind.\n\nThat day definitely sparked a passion in me — I’ve been hooked ever since, spending my free time exploring creeks, rivers, and outcrops around Texas looking for more fossils and artifacts.\n\nIf you’re into this kind of stuff, I’ll be posting more of my finds and adventures here under this account (u/NovelEarth) and on other platforms under the same name.

(105, 'reddit', '1ogie6e', 'Taiwan - dense beauty', 'The best way to experience Taiwan is to do a loop around the island. It can be by car, by train, or even on a bicycle. I did the train loop. I highly recommend the Tze-Chiang 3000 Limited Express, which has swanky new Hitachi trainsets. Business class is a great deal, comes with the most comfortable seats I\'ve experienced on a train, with some delicious meals - which alone justifies the modest premium. On the western side, you have the HSR (high-speed rail) which uses the same infrastructure as the Japanese shinkansen. However, I\'d still recommend going with the slower speed Tze-Chiang. The country is small enough that each journey will be an hour or two at most, and some of the high-speed rail stations are a bit further away, like Chiayi. \n\nThere\'s a ton to see in North Taiwan, some of the highlights are exploring Taipei\'s night markets, Jiufen &amp; Shifen, Yehliu Geopark, Tamsui, and… so much more! Oh, and there\'s a national park within Taipei\'s city limits. One could easily spend a week on the 8 mile Pingxi train line alone, where each stop has something special to offer.\n\nTaking a clockwise route, the next stop would be Yilan county, with Taipingshan being the standout highlight. Taroko Gorge is quite possibly the most beautiful place I\'ve visited, with Hualien being the best base. It\'s a quaint city with unique indigenous food.\n\nMoving further south, Chishang and Taitung. Chishang is a great place to cycle or walk around, with its network of vehicle free streets that cut through the rice fields and mountains. At the bottom of Taiwan is Kenting, for the beach and party life.\n\nRounding back up, Kaohsiung is a great modern city, with tons of entertainment options. It also has a vibrant scene of modern architecture, some bizarre! Standouts near Kaohsiung were the massive Fo Guang Shan Monastery, and beautiful migratory butterflies in Maolin. Tainan is the city of temples, with every other alley offering its own unique temple. Its outskirts also has interesting features, like Anping, and the majestic Chimei Museum.\n\nMoving back north, Alishan is essential. High in the mountains, its lined with Formosan cedar trees, and is the best place to experience cherry blossoms in spring. The Alishan Forest Railway is particularly scenic, one of the best train rides in the world. Taichung is Taiwan\'s second largest city and an industrial hub. I loved the science museum. Nearby, the mountains beckon, with Sun Moon Lake, Hehuanshan and Qingjing Farm. Some people find these place too \"touristy\", but they are so for good reason.\n\nFrom Taichung, you can close back the loop, back to the North Taiwan metropolis.\n\nThat was how I travelled across Taiwan, but here\'s some addition information I wrote up about Taiwan, for those interested:  \n  \nTaiwan is a small island in the South China Sea, similar in size to a small US state or EU country. Yet, it is densely packed with diverse beauty. Other regions with a similar density are Otago, New Zealand, Switzerland and Kansai, Japan; but Taiwan is altogether unique in bringing the best of all those.\n\n70% of Taiwan\'s land is mountains, with some of the tallest peaks in East Asia. Indeed, its highest point, Yushan, exceeds that of Japan or New Zealand\'s, and not far away from Switzerland\'s. Yet, as a tropical country, it\'s filled with dense rainforests. There are beautiful gorges, volcanic activity, wildlife, beaches - the whole lot.\n\nTaiwan\'s history is also fascinating, from the indigenous Austronesian peoples, to early Southern Chinese settlers to Qing Dynasty colonisation to Japanese colonisation to the Civil War, and in modern times, the most progressive society in Asia. This is reflected in its incredible architecture and temples.\n\nThen there\'s the modern side - Taiwan has immaculate tourist infrastructure and public transport, some of the very finest in the world. There\'s tons of quirky entertainment things, and of course, the food! It brings the very best of South East Asia\'s night market culture with the best of East Asian cuisine.\n\nPlease free to ask me anything. I\'ve captioned all the images.

(106, 'reddit', '1oenjm1', 'Don’t recognize my work? Have fun having no cake decorator during graduation season', 'Alright; so my little brother told me to post this here\n\nI’ve been an assistant deli/bakery manager for +6 years. In those years we had “Jill” take over the previous managers position through backstabbery and lies, a position that was supposed to go to me, but she had a friend in upper management get her transferred over. Jill never did any of the work, left things for me to do last minute, took four day weekends, intentionally ‘missed’ orders to try and make me look bad; the whole nine yards.\n\nI put up with it for years… Every time I brought it up with the management, they gave an excuse or sorta just brushed me off. The company has a union, so getting someone with even a year of seniority over you in trouble is almost impossible. I was doing more and more of the work, making sure orders went off on time, fixing ones she would forget or mess up, covering shifts, calling people to come in if she intentionally under scheduled us, training…. A headache.\n\nDuring this time, I got married (which she tried to deny me my vacation time to do) and had a hectic schedule that my husband graciously understood. Dealt with it for another few years and just got so tired with everything… then the kicker came! I got pregnant with our first!! I decided then and there that once I left for maternity, I wasn’t going back.\n\nI did everything by the books, notified management and the union, scheduled doctors visits and worked around my schedule, made sure that there was no possible way she could mess with me. Once I heard the due date; I grinned a maniacal smile deep in my soul. April… right before the busiest time for any deli/bakery… Graduation.\n\nWhen you’re in a town with 3+ colleges and 4 high schools just in a ten mile radius, you get a LOT of orders to fill. I even had a reputation for color matching certain school colors and doing cakes last minute. On any given day for those months, they could have anywhere from 15-150 cakes going out in a weekend (Friday-Sunday) and to make matters worse for them, I was the only cake decorator.\n\nI let them know that they had to get someone in and hired for me to train MULTIPLE times or else they would be in dire straights, especially since Jill didn’t like decorating. They never listened, like always. So after four months, I stopped reminding them. I let it go. And it felt great. Then I decided to use one of my vacations during the week before delivery (good thing I did, the baby was ready anyways) and they still hadn’t found a cake decorator.\n\nThe day I delivered my baby, guess who finally got demoted??? Jill had scheduled one of her four day weekends again, missed three supply orders, didn’t cover my shift, and the icing on the cake??? Left 19 cake orders unfulfilled for a Friday and did not let management know about them. When Friday morning came around and she wasn’t there; there was a line of angry customers wondering WHERE their cakes were.\n\nUpper store  management was called in, people from two different departments who had “some” experience on cakes were pulling premade 1/4 sheets and randomly throwing sprinkled this way and that and giving out the cakes for free. Over $1000 in products having to be given to customers… for… free…\n\nApparently this also happened on a day the district manager was set to come in and do a tour to make sure things were set up for graduation. Needless to say she was demoted and moved from the department the very day she came back into the store ( she turned off her phone over the weekend so no one would disturb her)\n\nI only know this because they called me to see if I could come back for a day or two from my “vacation” to fix everything. (They hadn’t known I had the baby yet, just thought I was still heavily pregnant). I’ve now been six months as a STHM and cannot be happier without all of the stress from there.\n\nThey still ask if I want my old job back when I grocery shop there, but I just smile and tell them no thank you. (Although I do miss some of my coworkers) now I get to raise an amazing little boy and bake cakes for the fun of it now.\n\nUpdate: WOW; I was not expecting any of this really! Thank you for the validation! Here is a few things to clear some things up for everyone\n\n1) Jill got demoted: she is now a produce clerk and is not allowed anywhere near the bakery deli and took a massive pay cut\n\n2) It did not cripple the whole store, it just made a department almost a living nightmare for management for the weekend, they now have their retired cake decorator in on weekends to do cakes until they can find someone else\n\n3) I had to take that unplanned vacation two weeks before my due date do to ✨✨StReSs✨✨ from the job that contributed to gestational hypertension (baby came out alert and happy, heart rate got to 164/98 though 😬)\n\n4) do I in no way, shape, or form blame the union or upper management for any of it. When two people are constantly issuing complaints to HR, the truth gets muddied. It did not help that the store went through 6 store managers while I was there and the union did what they could especially when it came to her trying to mess with my vacations, paid holidays, and days off. (Especially my wedding)\n\n5) doormat? No; I called her out on things all the time, which is why she was out to get me at any chance. I even had my staff stand up for me when I wasn’t there and she’s try to take credit for things I did. Paper trails were made, and I followed procedures for reporting things to the letter.\n\n6) did I intentionally leave innocent bystanders to have no cake? No; I warned management, they dragged their feet. I warned my customers, they chose to still go there. I did more than my fare share.\n\nThank you all very much 🩷\n\nUpdate 2: this is still going?!?\nThanks for all the upvotes! And here’s a little more\n\n1) I don’t plan on opening a bakery any time soon, there are five currently in my little town\n\n3) baby is amazing and healthy; he’s topping the charts in the 99th percentile all over!\n\n4) I wish this story was made up; but it’s not. I’ve left out numerous things on what she did that could have gotten her fired/demoted sooner if she didn’t have someone backing her as long as she did\n\n5) she got multiple warnings, but by the time she would do another mistake, a new manager would come in (which made it last way longer than it should have)\n\n6) my writing style? It’s all my own; so sorry if it is difficult to read. English is my first language (and only) but everyone knows that the language is five multiple different languages in a trench coat pretending to be one.\n\n6)one of the co-workers I had who is set to retire next year sent me messages about everything as it went down, realizing that the shared nightmare was finally coming to an end\n\nUpdate 3!\nSome of you are asking about cakes and cake questions: I don’t really know how to cross post or everything, but I created a new Reddit thing called cakesivemade with some photos on there for curiosity’s sake 🙃 ', 'ChaosRisingBook', 'pettyrevenge', 'https://reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1oenjm1/dont_recognize_my_work_have_fun_having_no_cake/', 9713, 231, '2025-10-24 09:37:02', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

Everyone will find out who the actual whore is', 'So I (15f) am in my sophomore year of high school and there was this girl (Also 15f) who we’ll call CF which will make sense later. CF and I used to be friends in 7th grade until she found out I had seizures and started bullying me for them. It was annoying and definitely stung but it was tolerable.\n\n\nThat was until 8th grade year. CF overheard me tell one of my friends that I had been raped by a boy in the year above me who was in high school (We had no evidence to prosecute him with so nothing could be done) CF then decided that made me a whore! So what does she do? Tell the entire school that I’m a whore, that I lost my v-card at 13, that I wanted to be raped, and cyber bully me online. In 8th grade I was shy and timid so I never spoke up about her harassment. Later in the year I changed to a different middle school for other reasons so I was free of CF for a while. \n\n\nThat didn’t last forever though as we go to the same high school. Freshman year I had my gym class with her and we stayed out of each other’s way. That was until she started talking shit again. Because apparently making school hell for me in middle school wasn’t enough, she wanted to do it in high school now too. \n\n\nLuckily, since middle school I had produced a shiny new backbone due to other crap I dealt with. So, when she started telling everyone how much of a whore I was again I did not stay silent. I didn’t necessarily traumatize her back at that time as I just said to anyone that asked that I was definitely not asking to be raped and most people understood. \n\n\nEverything came to a head though one day somewhere in May of this year. Our PE teacher had left the room for a moment and CF begins talking in front of the entire class.\n\n\nCF: “So [My name], had any other guys ‘rape’ (specifically said with finger air quotes) you recently or are you still denying how much you must have enjoyed it?”\n\n\nNow here’s the thing about CF, she openly dated her second cousin in middle school, full well knowing that they were cousins. As much as this grosses me out I had never said anything about it as it’s her life. Not this time.\n\n\nSo I look at her and respond with. “Like how you enjoyed screwing your cousin back in middle school?” She went silent and since everyone in the class was listening I figured id be polite and explain it for them. “What? You don’t remember dating your second cousin?”\n\n\nCF starts stammering. “I never did that.”\n\n\nI respond. “Oh are you sure, you cousin fucker? \nHow am I the whore here when you’re trying to make your family tree look like a ladder?”\n\n\nShe started crying. In front of everyone. Which in high school is basically an admission of guilt. Of course again with this being high school, word of this spread quickly and CF was mortified. \n\n\nNow, she avoids me like the plague and stays as far away from me as possible.

I explained I had booked the venue for a private party, she said \'that doesn\'t matter, my children want some food\'. I replied no because the food was for the party.\n\nShe walked away telling her children to just wait until I had left the food area. Realising she wasn\'t taking my answer, I asked staff to speak to her. \n\nThey did, explaining it was a private event and they needed to leave. She shouted that her and her children were not leaving and that I should be told to allow the children to have the food.\n\nI went back over, said again it was a private event, and she shouted \'what is a sandwich?!\' repeatedly at me, until I shouted back that she needed to leave.\n\nShe did eventually leave, \'flicking the Vs\' at me as she walked out the door.\n\nThe soft play wasn\'t at capacity, and in truth, there probably was enough for them to have some of the buffet, but the way she approached me with the assumption I\'d say yes, and then blatantly planning to disregard my answer made me stand my ground.\n\nSo AITA for kicking out the gatecrashers?\n\nEDIT:\nOK so first of all, I did not expect this to literally blow up the way it has... I thought a couple of people would say yes or no, and that would be it 😅\n\nApolgies for the long edit, but there\'s been a few \'themes\' within comments, so I\'ll try to address them;\n\n- A soft play is a massive indoor climbing frame covered in padding and safety nets, with slides and ball pits etc. I think some may call it a \'jungle gym\' but I\'m not sure that is a direct comparison\n\n- \'flicking the Vs\' is a peace sign but showing the back of your hand. About the same level of rude as giving the middle finger in the UK\n\n- The venue shares a desk with an adjoining spots hall, which wasn\'t running open sessions as it was hosting a game. Past the desk is the exit, (it\'s one door in, one door out thing) door 1 to the soft play, door 2 to the sports hall. I found out later she had come to use the sports hall and was told about the game. Staff thought she went out the exit\n\n- I\'ve spoken to the venue about her being able to get in, and they apologised and are changing how they operate the private sessions. Despite this happening, I think the place has appropriate security measures. I think she took advantage of staff being busy letting in spectators to the sports hall and tried her luck. As we have an invite for a party here in a few weeks, I\'ll know if they do and can raise it again if needed, but hopefully won\'t need to\n\n- I went back over when the staff member was talking to her because I felt bad that I put a young girl in the firing line. This woman was just shouting that she wasn\'t leaving, and I also hadn\'t spotted them come in, but I should have let her/her manager sort it\n\n- This is in the UK. This wasn\'t a food stamps have been taken and \'chance a free meal or starve tonight\' situation. When she eventually left she brought snacks out of the over priced vending machine. That obviously doesn\'t tell any of us her full story, but the venue has like 10 places with a few minutes walk where much more affordable snacks and food choices are\n\n- Some people asked about the kids ages. Top age of an invited child was 5. Her two kids were 8/9 and 9/10\n\n- I replied to a couple of comments that I would have told her the kids could have some after all the guests had eaten, if it had been a question and not a demand. I am responsible for my actions, but they were influenced by hers, and I am glad I stood my ground and wasn\'t bullied at my own event, although not proud that I did shout at the end\n\nAgain, I didn\'t expect this would get so much attention, but to those who were polite and asked questions, thank you.\n\nTo anyone who asked \'why are you even asking?\' or similar, I was asking to gauge if I was unreasonable for standing my ground because of her actions/reactions.

The station has a tiny listener base and our song requests have become so frequent that my coworkers have got a good rapport with one of the show hosts. I’ve never emailed in or interacted with the host in question.\n\nI come in today after a week off and hear myself being congratulated on the radio on my pregnancy … which was made up by my coworkers. Alison, what the hell. Everyone laughed and I wasn’t sure what to do but laugh along too. The host has apparently been doing this for a full week while I’ve been away (!?), saying both my name and the company’s. Beyond that, he sounded really earnest and genuinely happy, which is making me feel even worse.\n\nThere is the occasional prank in the office, but they’ve always been harmless. This feels like a line has been crossed and I don’t know what to do. We have monthly one-on-ones coming up and I’ll be speaking to our manager, but I’m not sure what do to in the meantime.\n\nAfter I heard it on the radio, everyone made comments about my pretend pregnancy. I don’t want to hear how caffeine is bad for the baby or planning the due date. I’m a woman in my mid-20’s in 2019 and can’t even believe I’m having to write this at all. My general response to not-funny jokes is just to not laugh or look confused, but I can’t take the thought of being publicly congratulated by a stranger. Tomorrow I’ll be asking the next person who makes a joke to be the one to write in and reveal the truth, but I know this won’t go down well.\n\nI’m the quietest person in the office and probably the most private, but it feels like such a bizarre thing to joke about that I don’t even know what the funny part is meant to be? I don’t want anyone to get formally disciplined for a one-off misjudgment, but I’m also not sure how to articulate why it’s a misjudgment without ruining my relationships with anyone.\n\n[Update 1](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/09/updates-the-fake-pregnancy-rumor-and-more.html)  **Sept 12, 2019 (3 months later)**\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for publishing my letter and for your thoughtful response. I was intensely frustrated when I wrote to you and worried I was overreacting, but your response along with the insight and stories of your commentators proved exactly why pregnancy isn’t something to joke about.\n\nThankfully, I have a positive response!\n\nA few commentators wondered if I was the only woman on the team. Staggeringly, the team is mostly women. We’re all around the same age, but I’m the only person who isn’t vocal about staying child-free. I think this is why they didn’t consider the prank to be a big deal, but every way I look at it just shows some terrible judgement.\n\nAs we’re a small company, the HR is split between our office manager (female, who was in on the prank) and our director (male, who wasn’t). The director wasn’t in the day after I heard the announcement, but I shut down any attempts to laugh about it with “stop, I don’t like this.” The following day, I pulled my director aside and told him that a) I wasn’t pregnant and b) the whole thing was problematic and needed to stop immediately. He was shocked that I hadn’t been in on the prank and was very supportive.\n\nNot long after, he pulled the office manager aside for a chat and then asked if I could help him with an errand that took us both out of the office for a while. When we came back, everyone was very sheepish and the radio was turned right down. No-one has apologized so I don’t know if they thought of me as a spoilsport, but I don’t really care!\n\nA few people wondered if the radio presenter knew the pregnancy was fake, but I think he believed it was genuine. My coworkers have played the game of “what crazy thing can we get him to say” before, and I think I was just collateral damage this time around. One of my coworkers emailed him and he stopped all mentions of the prank right away. But, in a twist, the radio station is (almost) no more! A couple of weeks after all this went down, every live show stopped and it looks like it’ll fold any day now.\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, he’s just a regular guy who did an afternoon show for fun. None of his shows have ever featured shock value or pranks, which is why the whole thing felt cruel. On the other hand, my coworkers do have a habit of taking things too far.\n\n\n[Update 2](https://www.askamanager.org/2025/10/update-my-coworkers-are-joking-that-im-pregnant-when-im-not.html)  **Oct 9, 2025 (over 6 years later)**\n\nI was reading AAM as I do every afternoon when one of the recommended posts catapulted me back into my past. I’m the reader who wrote to you about six years ago about my co-workers who wrote into a local radio station to pretending I was pregnant as a “prank.” I’ve been meaning to share an update for a while now, and this felt like a sign. In the years since, things got okay, worse and then much better.\n\nAfter the first post, I spoke to my director to put a stop to the joking around. No one apologized, acknowledged that they’d crossed a line, or even made eye contact for a while, but I was just grateful that the jokes were over.\n\nA few months later, my relationship unexpectedly fell apart, and a couple of weeks after that I found a channel on our internal messaging system that had been set up to talk about me behind my back. It had been running for months, predating the radio prank, and was absolutely a nail in the coffin. We also now had an external HR provision by this point, so I made a formal complaint against everyone involved. A coworker had been on the ropes for a while and they were let go not long after. I’m not sure how much the channel played a role in this, but it certainly didn’t help. The others apologized to my face, which I was grateful for at the time.\n\nAs some background, when I first started, the company was owned by two directors, a husband and wife. A couple of years into my tenure, one served the others with divorce papers and the business was squarely in the middle. But even before I started there were office norms that were only there to keep us in our lanes. We weren’t really allowed to talk to one another other than on IM, were made to take staggered lunches alone, had to sit with our screens facing outward so the boss could monitor what was on them, and so on. I found out later that my job only opened up because one director got drunk and threw a punch at a past employee on a work night out, prompting a few people to quit. When that director finally left, the other did try to open up communication but things just ran too deep. I’m sure I contributed to this environment too and I remember being deeply frustrated with nowhere for it all to go.\n\nI also don’t remember exactly what the messages in the channel said but I was so angry that it snapped me out of my post-breakup funk and made me realise that my workplace was crap and was not going to change. I searched for all the jobs I could find with a short list of prerequisites — they must have an active HR department, visible salary scales, and be based in an interesting part of the country. I applied for the one that was closing first, which turned into one of the best things I ever did. I said yes to an interview because I’d never been to this city and at least if I didn’t get the job I could spend a couple of hours in a museum I always wanted to visit. I interviewed in February 2020, got the job, and started my new role that April, just after the first Covid-19 lockdown hit in the UK. I moved to my new city about five years ago as restrictions were starting to lift, so as people were getting used to socializing again there was me starting life again in my late 20s.\n\nI’ve since changed roles a few times but have been in the same organization, and I can honestly say things are a million times better. My job is infinitely more fulfilling, has scope to grow, and I’m strengthening skills that are niche enough to be interesting and broad enough that I’m not stuck in a corner. I’m also actively involved in our workplace union so there’s a perfect outlet to channel any injustices in a positive way.\n\nI’m not in touch with anyone in my old job. I wish them the best and hope everyone is successful and fulfilled in their own ways, but it took me far too long to realize it wasn’t the place for me. The fact I didn’t realize this after someone *wrote to a radio station to pretend I was pregnant* is beyond what I’d ever put up with now. I’m still embarrassed by the whole ordeal but grateful I can look back on it as a bizarre story rather than a situation I’m still stuck in.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oaskd5/my_coworkers_are_joking_im_pregnant_when_im_not_6/', 9141, 298, '2025-10-19 21:31:01', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

I’ll try my best to avoid a wall of text!\n\nSo, my boyfriend (31m) and I (24f) have been dating for 3 years now. We live in an apartment together and we’re having the wonderful luck (that’s sarcasm btw) of having my boyfriend’s two best friends (32m and 35m) as our neighbors. They live right across from us, which is a huge issue because they come over literally everyday and it almost feels like I’m living in my apartment with three guys instead of just one. Sometimes they come over when my boyfriend isn’t even home and start engaging me in the most random and weirdest conversations. And sometimes these conversations are really disgusting, here’s an example.\n\nA few days ago I was at home and my boyfriend was at work. As always, 32m and 35m decided to come over without bothering to tell me beforehand that they were coming over. The conversation was really unsettling this time. They started talking about “how easy it could be to rape me” because, according to them, they could just walk in pretending to be my boyfriend and I wouldn’t know it was them. This freaked me out a little bit because this is my exact issue: Whenever the door to my apartment opens I always assume it’s my boyfriend but sometimes it’s them instead. However, as soon as they open their stupid mouth, I know for sure that it’s them and not my boyfriend.\n\nAs if this whole “I could rape you and you wouldn’t know it was me” thing wasn’t enough, they said that if I got pregnant by one of them, I wouldn’t know because I wouldn’t be able to see that my child would look like one of them instead of my boyfriend. I just sat there and thought what the f goes on in their brains?\n\nI’m used to people not knowing how to act in front of me because of my blindness, but my boyfriend’s friends conversations aren’t just uncomfortable or awkward, they’re terrifying. I don’t think they would ever touch me against my will but conversations like this are incredibly unsettling and I wish they would stop talking about me like that. I haven’t told my boyfriend about this exact situation but I told him that his friends make me uncomfortable. I’m afraid that my boyfriend won’t believe me when I tell him about this conversation because it’s just so absurd.\n\nI’m almost 100% sure that if I do tell my boyfriend about his friends’ behavior towards me, it will result in a 1 vs 2 situation. His friends will most likely deny anything I say and then it will be two statements (them) against one (me).\n\nJust for clarification: My boyfriend knows that his best friends come over even when he’s not at home but he doesn’t see it as a problem.\n\nWhat should I do? I’d be thankful for any advice.\n\nTL;DR: I am blind. My boyfriend’s best friends talk inappropriately about me and joke about raping me (because, according to them, I wouldn’t be able to tell them apart from my boyfriend due to me being blind). My boyfriend doesn’t know that they’re talking about me like this.\n\nEDIT: There are tons of people asking me how I was able to type this even though I\'m blind. I\'ve explained it several times in the comments already but people keep commenting about it and I\'m getting tired of explaining the same thing over and over again. There is a youtube video called \"How I use technology as a blind person\" by a woman called Molly Burke. Feel free to watch (or listen to) this video!\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**i_lick_icicles**\n\n&gt;Can you record that shit?\nAlso how do they go into the appartment, I think you can absolutely tell your boyfriend that you\'re not ok with them coming in when he\'s not around.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I\'ll definitely try to record it next time!\nThey have a key for the apartment (and we actually have one for their apartment as well), but it was supposed to be only used in emergency situations.\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**airaqua**\n\n&gt; \"I haven’t told my boyfriend about this exact situation but I told him that his friends make me uncomfortable.\"\n&gt;\n* Tell your bf about the conversation in detail, and tell him that his friends are no longer welcome ESPECIALLY if he\'s not around.\n&gt;\n&gt; \"I’m afraid that my boyfriend won’t believe me when I tell him about this conversation because it’s just so absurd.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; OP, most women your bf\'s age would have never put up with this sort of behaviour in the first place. Just popping in whenever? Simply nope.\n&gt;\n&gt; If your bf doesn\'t believe you, or takes his friends\' site, break it up, get out.\n&gt;\n&gt; \"but he doesn’t see it as a problem.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; They have their own home....why do they need to come over when it\'s just you? Why don\'t you deserve private time? Start looking the door, take their keys away, or replace the lock.\n\n**OffusMax**\n\n&gt;&gt; Please lock your door. If they have a key, insist on having the lock changed and do not give them a copy. Tell your boyfriend that if they come into your place again you’re moving out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is bullshit. If your boyfriend supports his friends over you, then you don’t want him for a boyfriend. That’s not how someone in a committed relationship should act. You should be the most important thing in the world to him.\n\n**~**\n\n**Moggy-Man**\n\n&gt; OP, you need to get OUT of this situation ASAP. With or without your boyfriend.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is INSANE that these guys joke about this. Believe me in absolutely no way shape or form is this normal. At all.\nThis feels like a ticking time bomb and I\'m genuinely concerned for your safety.\n\n**jimmyjrdanceparty**\n\n&gt;&gt;I honestly feel sick to my stomach imagining how incredibly unsafe OP must feel. Being blind is already a vulnerable way to walk through the world, especially as a woman, and to have two people who have unrestricted access to your home explicitly say that they could RAPE you whenever they wanted? Good lord, I want to cry for her.\n\n\n[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l3lgml/update_i_24f_am_blind_and_my_boyfriends_friends/)  **Jan 23, 2021**\n\nThis is actually a re-post of my update. I posted this only a few days after my original post but I must\'ve somehow deleted it because it doesn\'t show up on my profile anymore. I\'m very sorry about that. Using technology as a blind person doesn\'t always go smoothly... but at least I was able to find the saved copy of my update on my laptop.\n\nBefore anyone asks again: Yes, blind people are able to use computers and phones. The amount of people that think that I’m lying about being blind because I’m able to use a computer, a phone and Reddit is sickening. If you are interested to see how blind people use technology watch the video “How I use technology as a blind person” by Molly Burke on YouTube. This will hopefully answer your questions.\n\nA lot of people in the comments have pointed out the urgency of the situation and told me to immediately tell my boyfriend about his friend’s behavior. My boyfriend came home around 5 hours after I made that post and I was planning on telling him everything, but he was in an incredibly bad mood and just wanted to go to bed, so I didn’t do it. To be honest, at this point I still didn’t fully realize the urgency of the situation even though so many people pointed it out. The next day, my boyfriend went to work again and I decided to wait for him at home because I didn’t have the possibility to go anywhere else, but I contacted my parents and told them about my situation. That way, at least SOMEONE would know about me if something bad happened.\n\nThis time, when m32 and m35 came into my apartment (the door was locked, they have a key), I wasn’t just uncomfortable with them being there, I was in fact on the verge of having a panic attack. They must’ve noticed that because they did some disgusting things to me while behaving as if this whole thing was funny. They did NOT rape me but what they did wasn’t okay. I started screaming, which kind of scared off m35 and m32 and luckily an elderly lady from the floor above heard me screaming. I swear, this lady was my guardian angel. She didn’t force me to explain anything and just took me to her apartment. She was comforting me for nearly two hours during which I couldn’t stop bawling my eyes out.\n\nPerhaps this is life’s way of telling me to stop being so naive. My dad always told me “Vorsicht ist besser als Nachsicht” = “Better safe than sorry”. From now on I will definitely follow this advice. I will never wait for things to escalate like this again.\n\nWhen my boyfriend came home I was finally able to tell him about everything. I’ve never witnessed him being so angry. He genuinely thought that his friends were helping me out when he was at work and he apologized for not taking me seriously when I told him that his friends make me uncomfortable.\n\nOf course, things couldn’t just end here. My boyfriend was so angry that he decided to go over to his friends’ apartment. There was lots of yelling and it resulted in a physical fight. My boyfriend seems to have no injuries though. Shortly after, my boyfriend took some time off work, packed our bags and drove us to my parents’ house. We are currently trying to find a new apartment, but it will take some time to find one that is suitable for a blind person.\n\nThank you so much for all of the comments on my original post and all of the private messages! I couldn’t answer all of them but please know that I appreciate every single comment and message.\n\nTL;DR: I was able to tell my boyfriend everything and am now at my parents\' house to avoid any contact with m32 and m35.\n\n**FINAL COMMENTS**\n\n**Elainya**\n\n&gt; Never underestimate the power of old German ladies coming to the rescue.

(113, 'reddit', '1oee8h4', 'I think my boyfriend is lying about being in medical school', '**I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throwaway839427**\n\n**I think my boyfriend is lying about being in medical school**\n\n**Originally posted to r/relationship_advice**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/OL3YqZSqSd)  **Sept 7, 2021**\n\nI (26F) have been dating Sam (31M) for about four months now. We met online and he told me he was going to be a doctor. The first two months were fine but the last two months I have started to feel like he hasn\'t been honest about several aspects of his life, the biggest being him in medical school. He used to live overseas and was in medical school there for a short time (I\'m pretty sure this is true because I\'ve seen pictures). That was about five years ago.\n\nThe school that he says he goes to is fairly prestigious, and I have another friend (Jason) who graduated with a medical degree from the same school. Jason has told me how difficult the program was and how he never had time for anything besides studying. Jason also said that nobody in his program worked. Sam works 40hrs a week in an office, and I\'ve never once seen him study. He always seems to have a completely open schedule to hang out all the time, which I thought was odd. I asked him why he never is studying and he said he doesn\'t need to. I was always a good test-taker and never studied a lot in college, but I still feel like medical school is a whole different ball game.\n\nI\'ve spent a lot of time at Sam\'s house and have never seen a single document suggesting he was in school, textbooks, assignments, nothing. He also has let me use both of his computers and I\'ve never seen anything on his history or anything suggesting anything to do with school. I don\'t know about you guys, but when I was in school I had papers all over my house and my computer always had school stuff on it.\n\nA few weeks ago we were at dinner and (I can\'t remember how this was brought up) but he mentioned that the human ear has 30-something bones in it. I know from high school biology that it has 3 bones, and I said he was wrong. He said something to the effect of \"I\'m a medical student, how are you going to tell me I\'m wrong?\" So I googled it right in front of him and showed him that I was correct, and he seemed mad. I then asked him how many bones were in the human body and he was wrong again. I feel like this is pretty basic stuff a medical student would know, right? Even I know that.\n\nSo this week I\'ve been feeling suspicious so I decided to prod. I asked him if I could come sit in on one of his classes, and he said his school \"doesn\'t do that\". Fine. I asked if we could meet up on campus for lunch, and he said I couldn\'t come because you need a student ID to get on campus due to COVID. Fine. I asked to see his student ID, and he said he lost it. Then I asked him if he could send me a selfie of him in his hospital uniform and he said he doesn\'t like the way he looks in a white coat (he sends me other selfies all the time).\n\nI feel like at this point he\'s lying, but some of my friends say I\'m being paranoid. If he is lying, how should I prove it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: He\'s not actually my boyfriend, he\'s just someone I\'ve been seeing frequently. I just wrote that for the ease of the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Felt it was worth noting that these past six weeks have been summer vacation, so he hasnt needed to be in class. He said he would get a new student ID when classes start.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt;Honey, you need to walk away.  The red flags are waving in the breeze.  Loudly.  If he will lie about this, there is no limit to what we will lie about.  Does he even work where he says he does?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I\'ve been to his office job and met his coworkers. So yes, I know he works 40 hours in an office.\n\n**knightridergirl80**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me tell you this from the perspective of someone who caught a liar.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Once you catch them in a lie this big, the trust is just gone. You’re always going to have it in the back of your mind that he’s lying, even when he’s telling the truth. Lying about being in medical school is a big lie.\n\n**~**\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt;Of course he\'s lying.  Of course he is.  Wow, that is all kinds of manipulation and crazy shit.  You already know this.  Don\'t you?  I\'m trying to be kind, but why haven\'t you called him out really?  Why on Earth would you buy into this deceit?  I\'m guessing you are afraid that you\'d find out the truth and then be confronted with whether or not you need to end the relationship and you don\'t want to end the relationship.  I get it but this is so ridiculous that I\'m worried for you.  He has to have a student ID.  Does he have a parking sticker?  I\'m guessing not and he\'s going to give you some stupid excuse as to why not.  Your friends say you\'re being paranoid?  Lol, are they really friends?  Nope, nope and absolutely not.  If this guy is in medical school, then I\'m not an ER nurse. (Granted, retired). A 10 year old knows how many bones are in the human ear.  Don\'t minimize your suspicions.  You are right.  You are smart.  He is lying.  I\'m not even buying the overseas medical school story based on his knowledge of the human body.  He sounds manipulative.  Please be careful.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;The first month we dated I only saw him two or three times. And the last month has been summer vacation, so no classes. I didn\'t really think about it. I only started REALLY getting suspicious when we had the conversation about ear bones, which was three weeks ago. Now I\'ve looked back and realised how suspicious it all sounds.\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;It isn\'t even that suspicious, it\'s just lying.  And he gets angry when you proved him wrong?  Girl, you\'ve only been dating this lunatic for a short time.  Trust me, he\'s not in any prestigious medical school.  He\'s not in ANY medical school. I doubt he\'s even IN college given the lack of any supportive evidence.  If he\'s lying about this (I know he is) what else is he lying about?  You have to have a completed Bachelors degree, usually in the sciences at an accredited university and then pass the MCAT to be considered for Med school, and that\'s not even a guarantee.  I have a couple of MD friends, sent one a screen shot and she laughed so hard (sorry) said if he\'s telling the truth, she doesn\'t want him working on her patients.  He\'s lying.  I\'m sorry your going through this but better to find out the truth.  There\'s a couple ways.  Ask him what he got on his MCAT (medical college admissions test). It is REQUIRED for enrollment into any accredited medical school.  It does include a lot of science questions on it, so that is why most Drs have a bachelors in the science arena.  Ask him what classes he\'s taking.  It should be a lot of anatomy, biology, chemistry, histology.  Most first years study on average 4 to 8 hours a DAY.  My friend is a biology and chemistry genius and she studied 3 to 4 hours daily her first year.  It got worse the second year.     Medicine is one of the hardest degrees on the world.  If it was that easy, we\'d all be MDs.  I\'m so sorry you\'re going through this but better to know the truth.  Listen to your gut.  Not for nothing but my MD friend also mentioned that someone who goes to these extremes doesn\'t just have low self esteem.  Usually when they\'re caught, they play the \"I have low self esteem\" or I just wanted you to like me or I WAS in medical school and I WAS planning on returning. It\'s a little scarier than that.  So be careful.  Sometimes these people really suffer from significant mental illness.  You\'ve only dated him for 4 months and they are quite good at hiding it.  Please be careful.  Good luck.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/fUCIgqjbpv)  **Sept 12, 2021 (5 days later)**\n\nSo, the response what overwhelming and I\'m glad I got confirmation on my suspicions because I felt like I was going crazy. I broke up with him over FaceTime and didn\'t tell him the real reason, just gave a vague explanation about not being ready to date anybody. There are other things (in addition to my post) that I\'m pretty sure he was also lying about. I didn\'t bring any of his lies up because honestly I feel slightly scared of a person who would lie about things like that. \n\nHe didn\'t take it very well, and sent me a barrage of texts trying to guilt-trip me and also was borderline harassing me into meeting up with him (apparently he bought me a present and was trying to force me to take it). Overall just really gaslight-y and manipulative. I eventually just stopped responding and I haven\'t heard anything in a few days. Hopefully never have to see or speak to him again. Thanks to you all for your responses. Going forward, I\'ll be a lot more cautious about who I believe.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**AUrugby**\n\n&gt; I didn’t see your original post, but I’m an actual medical student, and that guy is 100% lying about being in medical school. You have next to no free time outside of class and studying. There is no way the dude is working 40 hours and is a “good test taker” to get through school, it’s just not possible. The level of detail and volume of work is so massive that it requires daily practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds like the guy was in school, flunked out, and hasn’t accepted it yet\n\n**thesippycup**\n\n&gt;&gt;Lmao same.

As a sidenote I know very little about computers other than basic googling skills.\n\nMy brother is a very type-A person. Very perfectionist and hardworking, often to the detriment of himself and others. He is a nice and positive person and is successful in the traditional sense, but he is very controlling and has a bit of an overblown ego. I\'m a much more relaxed person and the two of us share very little in the way of interests or guiding philosophies. I\'m a visual arts major who likes to draw and he\'s the type of person who watched Fight Club and thought that Tyler Durden was onto something. We get along but have hostilities.\n\nMy brother resents the fact that I am not like him and that I don\'t look up to him as a role-model. He is very fond of mocking my interests/hobbies/career plans and he often talks literally about a \"plan\" for me in which I change my major to engineering and start taking his advice. When he brings this up now over the phone I stop talking to him for whatever amount of days/weeks until he apologizes and we do it all over again.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my brother made a joke referencing a piece of digital art I drew on my laptop. I didn\'t think anything of it until I realized after the call ended that I never posted that piece of art anywhere, not even onto any cloud service-- it had only been available on my physical laptop.\n\nI was nervous and downloaded Malwarebytes but it didn\'t find anything. Thinking back I also recalled my brother making a joke about something I said to a friend privately on my Discord, which also was not publicly available. Checking Gmail and a few other websites I\'m on that showed options I discovered someone had been logging into my accounts from an unfamiliar computer and had then been doing so for about a week.\n\nI called my brother about this and he laughed and told me that he had remote access to my computer and that he\'d be \"checking\" up on everything I was doing from this point on. I told him that that was ridiculous and he basically laughed and said that people today have no reasonable expectation of privacy anyway.\n\nWithout going into detail I\'ve basically discovered that my brother literally has access to everything in my life. My bank account, school account, my art/chat accounts, all the files on my computer. He has even referenced information that leads me to think there is a very good chance of him having a camera/microphone in my room (he has been in my apartment in the last month and the only reason I think he might not is because I haven\'t been able to find it.)\n\nThere is nothing on my computer or Cloud files or anything I\'m even remotely embarrassed about. But the idea that my brother has all my information is terrible and I want him to stop. I don\'t feel comfortable in my apartment or using my computer/personal accounts anymore. I\'m writing this from my school\'s library.\n\nIs there a way to clearly show him that this is wrong with an amount of force and guarantee my privacy in the future WITHOUT getting him in serious trouble? My brother is an idiot and I\'m pissed at him for this (especially in the way where he acts like it\'s a joke or that he\'s doing it to \"mentor\" me, which he keeps saying, like he has called me knowing my class schedule which I never told him and reminded me to go to classes/etc) but I don\'t want his life should be ruined over this even if he is an asshole. He has also \"joked\" about dropping my classes which I got really pissed at and he assured me it was a joke but I still feel uncomfortable that he\'d even hint at that.\n\nThanks.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9bveru/update_my_brother_hacked_into_everything_and_is/) - August 31st, 2018\n\nWithout going into a lot of detail, based on some of the stuff I read on here and a conversation with a friend, I realized that the way I viewed the relationship with my brother was incredibly messed up and I decided to act more seriously about this. I was thinking about how to proceed last night while cleaning, and then I actually found a camera. I know I said I thought there was one before but I don\'t think I really consciously did. It was in my bathroom.\n\nI have gone to the police station and for now have an injunction against my brother. I also reported the computer hacking along with texts and a phone message he sent where he both alludes to and directly confirms it, so.\n\nI don\'t know what\'ll happen but I feel a lot better having taken this right. I appreciate the comments people sent it helped a lot.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9e6in5/update_update_my_brother_hacked_into_everything/) - September 8th, 2018\n\nWithout exaggeration, this was probably the worst day of my life.\n\nAfter getting served the injunction/temporary restraining order thing, my brother 1. told my parents and 2. chose to immediately violate it. He left me several messages that essentially was low key threatening to ruin my life and I was scared so I reported it. He was taken to jail and to my current understanding is going to get a type of misdemeanor charge for it if he already hasn\'t. I don\'t know if he\'s in jail right now.\n\nI knew my parents were going to take his side but they have effectively disowned me for this. My parents are very religious conservative catholics (i\'m not religious anymore but they don\'t know that) and they were very upset by me reporting it. That\'s an understatement. I have enough scholarships where I will be able to continue paying for my living expenses/school with my part time job but they way they treated me was horrible. They\'re very upset because this\'ll probably screw up his college according to the talks we\'ve had. They said I\'m disgusting/not welcome home etc. My dad sent me a video of him and my mom burning most of the belongings i left at his house (not much important to me but still). they don\'t believe me about the camera and my dad said he specifically didnt care even if it was there. just screaming the entire time, i stopped answering my phone and checking my email because it terrifies me. I bought a new cheap computer because even though someone helped me wipe it clean, I\'m honestly too scared of using the old one at this point.\n\nI haven\'t left my room in a week. the worst of it is over i think but i feel like i felt in a pit. I can\'t stop crying.\n\n[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9ncv9e/update_update_3_my_brother_hacked_into_everything/) - October 11th, 2018\n\nHi. Still in California. I\'m having some new problems since my last update and i\'m unsure how to handle them. i\'d like to say things have been good but they haven\'t. I had to stop school this semester because I\'ve became extremely depressed and couldn\'t handle the workload of both school/work and some personal things I\'m focused on related to my sexual orientation. Planning on going back next semester. Really can\'t focus on anything past work and my life feels very empty rn. Need to leave the house more haha and talk to someone who isn\'t a customer.\n\nMy brother is still in police custody and still in the process of getting convicted, which apparently takes much longer than i\'d thought. My parents and a few random people their age who I think they have recruited for this have been continually harassing me through various electronic means/random phone numbers (they do *67 or something) and spreading false rumors about me and I was too depressed to deal with it properly with another restraining order /other thing so it\'s just been easier to ignore.\n\nMy main problem at the moment is that I\'m trying to get a new job but I can\'t because I need my SSN. When I broke off with my parents and this happened i had some of my important documents with me but not the ones that college students won\'t use on a daily basis (passport, ssn, birth certificate). I\'m embarrassed but I don\'t have it memorized, the last time I needed it my parents sent me a picture (before all this happened) but i no longer have that in my texts.\n\nI called my parents to send them to me and tried to make it sound like I\'d call the police if they didn\'t and my father implied that he either burned them or would never give them to me. He didn\'t (visibly) burn them in the video he sent but I don\'t know if that was everything. I have trouble talking to him right now and I couldn\'t maintain it. I tried calling his parish leader who I know and he told me he\'d talk to my parents about not giving me the info/harassing me but it hasn\'t done anything if he did surprise surprise.\n\nThe only documents i have to prove id are my permit and my school id (which is useless in this scenario). I need more documents if I want to get a new SSN card. I\'m also scared of my parents having this information because I think they might try to mess with my life. I\'m afraid that if I call the police my dad will just claim that he never had it and burn it/hide it forever and then I\'m screwed without any way to fully prove my current identity to get new documents.\n\nAlso I want to change my name and I\'d appreciate if anyone knows the best way to go about doing that or if it\'d be too much of a pain right now. Not that big of a deal and honestly still lazy but would make me feel better if it\'s not a big thing.\n\nThank you very much the people here have been very helpful to me at a point in my life when I don\'t really have anyone to talk to or give me advice in regards to these types of legal issues.\n\n[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ac4exo/3679_update_update_4_my_brother_hacked_into/) - January 3rd, 2019\n\nI just want to make this post because i think it\'s good to make a point about how the world actually works and i don\'t like leaving things under the false impression that everything ended up being okay.\n\nThe last five months of 2018 were the worst months of my life because of everything that happened with my brother and me being disowned by my family, my family\'s friends, and many other people who I thought I knew/respected.\n\nI ended up getting my documents back without too much trouble but after that everything has been a loss. My brother was not really punished in any substantive way. My parents have endeavored to protect him and he basically got something on the level of probation no jail time. He was fired but has been hired again with a much better job with a small private company because (I\'m told) of a connection with a colleague. He (or my parents but I think him for various reasons) had various people call me up from unlisted numbers with vaguely threatening messages calling me a whore or just breathing on the phone until I had to get a new number. Rumors have been spread about me to the point where I don\'t feel comfortable even talking to nice people I knew because I\'m afraid they\'ll judge me based off things they\'ve seen that aren\'t true. I still am not going to be able to go back to college this semester because of personal and financial reasons and I basically have lost all my friends due to either personal insecurity, severe depression, or the rumors. I don\'t leave my house outside of work and I\'m not taking care of myself in the way I should. Very grossly thin and pale (working on getting better though) and i\'ve been having very terrible dreams about going to hell and burning alive forever which are driving me crazy. I\'m not going to do anything dramatic but mentally I\'m not where I need to be.\n\nI\'m not trying to make this a pity party, and I acknowledge that I\'m a big part of the reason this happened (in the sense that I\'m not handling it in the most productive way), and I\'m not asking for help (I have a shitty job that allows me to stay alive fine, just having trouble getting to school, which I think I\'ll be able to start again this summer) but I want to emphasize how fucked up the whole system is. This is the second time in my life I\'ve been put in this position and my first time as an adult and someone trying to report it and either way I have been screwed, lied to, and watched the person who ruined my life get away and live happier ever after.\n\nNobody cares about people who get violated and I understand why they don\'t come out and report. It\'s all rigged.\n\nMy brother, his girlfriend and my parents are almost two week long Hawaiian cruise right now smiling and laughing and i\'m in my apartment still unable to sleep right because of all this. Happy new year enjoy your cruise hahaha what a cool picture of water slide XD!\n\nAgain, thanks to this community at the least. It was a big help in the early stages when I needed to get my thoughts together, and I really appreciated it. I hope everyone who was cool about it gets the type of life they deserve. Really thank you.\n\n[Update 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bqmdiv/update_update_5_my_brother_hacked_into_everything/) - May 19th, 2019\n\nI moved to another state now. For the purposes of the final update it doesn\'t matter.\n\nThings have settled for me as of four weeks ago and I remembered a lot of people sending me messages and PMs so I thought I would give a final update.\n\nLife isn\'t good in the sense that everything is perfect, i 100% absolutely DO NOT believe in \"karma\" or that good things happen to people who do good and versa with evil people but things ended up working that way in this scenario after all the shit.\n\nLong story short is three months ago my brother was diagnosed with a terminal illness and he died about two months later this april. We don\'t have a family history with this and i found out about it more than a month after his diagnosis. Did not see him after his death and whatever campaign he had to bug me with his buddies just stopped all of a sudden when he found out about it, so I guess he lost interest once he found out he didn\'t have much time. i don\'t know many details because i\'m not involved and I obviously didn\'t try to be but he\'s dead.\n\nI\'m glad. Felt bad about it for a day or two and then just thought, no, really done with it. the universe threw me one fucking freebie and i\'m going to appreciate it. I honestly feel freer and happy and I hope he died in as much pain as could be expected.\n\nMy life is \'good\' right now. The past nine months have been some of the worst times of my life but things have settled into almost niceness. Uni is postponed at the moment and maybe forever but i\'ve found a good job i like in a much cheaper state that i like more and don\'t have to work at a lot. i have plenty of free time now and i\'m having fun with it instead of sitting in misery. Started drawing again and reading incredibly depressing online superhero novels. Also pushing myself to make new friends and going to look into therapy soon, feeling alive again. Taking care of my health again and am not undereating anymore.\n\nParents have reached out twice and i ignored them. Planning to do again and forever. I hope they rot and i don\'t feel bad about it anymore, sick of feeling guilty, sick of feeling sick. They\'re the fucked up people, not me. All i want to do now is hear about whenever they go and join my brother.\n\nI don\'t want to say \'my brother suddenly got cancer and died and that fixed everything and i\'m happy now\' because that isn\'t true but he died and i\'m glad about it and yes it did make me feel happy and i\'m finding it much easier to be happy now. i wish i could say I didn\'t need luck to fix my problems but whatever.\n\nThanks for everyone who sent me messages and offered me types of help even if i didn\'t take it. I had four onetime conversations with four people and that meant a lot to me.\n\nHope only nice things happen to you guys. Thanks again.\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs**\n\n# I AM NOT OOP', 'Informal_Rule_8604', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ok4j82/my_brother_hacked_into_everything_and_is_trying/', 8052, 824, '2025-10-30 22:33:41', '2025-11-07 23:43:29');

She has two boys her and her husband are separated but still married legally and living together. Recently we went to a Fair where she expected me to pay for everything. Every-time we’ve ever went anywhere I’d pay. \n\nThe last time we went out I suggested apple bees because it’s cheaper and I don’t mind paying usually and she said she was expecting something more fancy… as if it was a date. Mind you I am also married happily. I just laughed it off we went to Apple bees anyways. \n\nWell recently we go to the fair with our kids for a play date where never once did I say I was paying because I am not a millionaire and I can’t afford to take a family of 3 plus me and my son so really a family of 5 to the fair. We get there and I’m buying the pass for my son and myself and she said she left her wallet in her car no big deal I’ll pay and then she can just Venmo me. I pay for all the passes, we go on rides we are having fun and it’s time to eat. \n\nWe get food at the fair which was extremely expensive and her kids are just yelling out what they want this and she has absolutely no control of them so I hurry to order everything and this girl has to nerve to add hella more food to the order which comes out to $110. \n\nAfter we eat it’s getting really hot our kids are tired so I ask her like hey before we leave can you Venmo me she looks me dead in the eyes and said she has no money and that she’s broke her husband cut her off basically and I told her IF you knew that why tf did you suggest the fair and why did you say you would Venmo me????? \n\nShe said because I don’t understand since me and my husband both have good paying jobs and she’s a SAHM so it’s harder.  I didn’t know what to say and I just said okay, put my son in his stroller and got up to leave and she’s follows with her kids. \n\nAs we are leaving she has the nerve to say she wishes they could go into this escape room NOT included in the passes I bought everyone and keeps looking at me like with these begging face. Honestly it made me like feel disgust so I said no, we need to go back it’s getting late and my kid needs to nap. We both say bye, same day she’s calling and texting asking for the next hang out and inviting herself to my house saying she can come right now with her boys I say I’ll get back to her. \n\nNow it’s been 4 days and she calls and texts me everyday which I don’t respond to. After I told my husband about everything and he told me to absolutely cut her off and that it’s Triffling and she’s completely taking advantage of me. Has anyone else ever experienced something like this? \n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI texted her and said exactly how I feel and that she needs to pay me back, she got mad I ended up blocking her and not responding to her last text. It won’t let me upload the screenshots so I’m going to just copy paste the messages. \n\nMe:  Hey ik you\'ve been texting and calling to hang out and schedule but honestly I\'m not really interested unless you can pay me back for the other day. I spent a lot of money and you lied to me and told me you Venmo. I feel like you took advantage of me because we were in front of the kids when I asked you to pay me back. I would never do ts to you. You\'re just assuming that we are well off because we both work when in reality it\'s because we budget. If you had been straight forward that you didn\'t have money I would have brought snacks and we could have gone to the free splash pad or the park or literally anything free.\n\nHer response: What do you expect from me l\'m depressed and going through a divorce and have no money. I tell you the truth and then you use it against me???? You\'re just holding everything you paid for over my head when I never asked you to do that. SMH\n\nMe: You literally DID ask me to do that wtf you said you were going to Vemmo me and literally lied to my face. And made sure to wait until AFTER I paid for everything. I get you\'re depressed and I\'m sorry for what you\'re going through but that has no correlation to you lying and waiting until after I paid to guilt trip me.\n\nHer response: I have enough going on right now I really don\'t need to be dealing with this honestly\n\nMe: So are you going to pay me back or not???\n\nHer response: Not you don\'t need me to pay you back you\'re doing just fine you\'re just a greedy person. You literally have your husband paying for everything you have no idea what it\'s like to struggle and I am struggling so bad rn. We are staying together for the kids but he doesn\'t help me with anything and I never have money\n\nMe: You literally showed up with Starbucks tho???\n\nHer response:  You\'re going to be like that and watch all my expenses? Why are you even texting me l don\'t want to be friends with someone that\'s going to hold everything over my head. You\'re just a greedy person you think you\'re better than me and you\'re not. You always look down on people I never should have told you shit about my marriage because you clearly don\'t even care.\n\n\nI never responded to her last text and just blocked her.

The company that issued MMTLP successfully filed subpoenas to Citadel, Virtue, DTCC, and others for trading and share data. Multiple credible sources further confirm (1) the MMTLP stock price\'s exponential explosion before the rare U3 halt and reversal and (2) that a resolution is virtually guaranteed at this point. Upon resolution of MMTLP, the gates open for the resolution of naked shorting with GME as well as other heavily naked shorted basket stocks.**\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nRecommended Prerequisite DD:\n\n1. [The Golden Treasure Part I \\[100% Proof Apes Get Paid\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ahuip4/the_golden_treasure_100_proof_apes_get_paid/)\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n[The Golden Treasure Part II \\[100% Proof Apes Get Paid\\]](https://imgur.com/a/iBtj97o)\n\n§1: MMTLP History to Now / Further Confirmation of Naked Shorting\n\n§2: New Presidential Administration Wants Resolution\n\n§3: Post-Resolution Opens Gates for GME Resolution\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n**§1: MMTLP History to Now / Further Confirmation of Naked Shorting**\n\nI want to start with a quick disclaimer for those that haven\'t read Part I of my DD, or those that need a refresher. **This stock is non-tradeable.** It has been that way for years at this point. You can neither buy nor sell it. So, this DD, is in no way, shape, or form, some advertisement to get investors to purchase this stock.\n\nThat being said, the situation surrounding MMTLP/Next Bridge Hydrocarbons is highly relevant to GME. I\'ll get into a general history of the foundation of MMTLP and events leading to the current circumstances, and I\'ll try to condense the history here, but bare with me, because it can get complicated.\n\nFrom what I\'ve gathered, MMTLP started as a preferred share stock dividend that was given out to holders of TRCH in June, 2021 as part of a reverse merger with MMAT. Essentially, MMTLP was a spinoff from MMAT that later resulted into the creation of Next Bridge Hydrocarbons (an oil and gas company) in December 2022. The interesting thing is that this dividend (MMTLP) was never supposed to trade, but it began trading in October, 2021. The CEO of TRCH at the time, John Brda, stated that not only was it never supposed to trade (See page 2 of [Report from Congressional Research Service on MMTLP \\[2023\\]](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IN/PDF/IN12228/IN12228.2.pdf)), but he wasn\'t able to find out who made it trade. FINRA, a regulatory agency overseeing the trading of stocks, approved it to trade, but declined to tell the executives at TRCH who \"pushed the button\" and made it trade unauthorized.\n\nIt is theorized that SHFs (short hedge funds) \"forced\" MMTLP to trade, so that they could heavily naked short the stock; thereby, making profits as usual. The company was aware of this and proactively tried to protect investors from having their stock manipulated.\n\nFast forward to December 2022, MMTLP, the spinoff, was going to go private. Trading was supposed to last until December 12, 2022, then become Next Bridge Hydrocarbons (the Vice President of OTC Markets even confirmed it was supposed to trade up until the 12th). By going private, **all short positions were supposed to close**. This could, depending on how heavily naked shorted MMTLP was, beget a short squeeze, leading to the 12th of December, 2022. That was the theory, and it turned out to be correct, because on December 9, 2022, multiple investors reported their limit stop orders were getting executed on December 9th (See \"The Golden Treasure Part I\"). Further evidence, in addition to the evidence presented in Part I of my DD, solidifies the fact that prices were indeed going for 100x-10,000x right before FINRA stepped in an U3 Halted the stock and reversed trades on December 9, 2022.\n\n[Trading data from E-Trade](https://x.com/anna_trades/status/1812508669742813649) shows right before trading was halted, that there was a short squeeze:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmlxf9trfoxf1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=354661eb5115a3757246d3f44cf3cedba7f25fdd\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-i1vog29c1mxf1.jpg?width=426&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35b8f71330404a145727c0610256f093759620fb)\n\nMoreover, a highly credible source in the community (Drew Diligence; who has acted as a liaison between Congress and obtaining a resolution for MMTLP shareholders, garnering letters of support from over a dozen members of Congress) stated that he is aware of at least 1 person that got a 10-99 tax form from the IRS confirming that his shares were executed at prices ranging from $250-$500 (around a 120x of its $3 price pre-squeeze).\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ohiz4y/video/w7i641kmioxf1/player\n\nSo, yes, there was unequivocally a short squeeze right before FINRA U3 Halted the stock and reversed trades. This would also explain exactly why FINRA U3 Halted the stock, since a \"U3\" halt is a trading code that stands for \"Extraordinary Events Halt\" (the extraordinary event here, would be that SHFs were indisputably about to get liquidated). Moreover, MMTLP was the last stock to be U3 halted by FINRA, [according to data from FINRA itself](https://otce.finra.org/otce/tradingHalts).\n\nBy indefinitely U3 halting the stock, FINRA (1) froze the stock, (2) protected SHFs from needing to close their short positions, and (3) locked all 64,000+ MMTLP investors in this crime scene.\n\nAfter FINRA U3 Halted the stock and reversed trades, tens of thousands of investors began working to get transparency and a resolution towards trading, reaching out to state and federal representatives, filing lawsuits against FINRA, protesting outside the SEC HQ in D.C, etc.\n\nThe company (MMTLP/Next Bridge Hydrocarbons) has also been fighting back as well. FINRA published an FAQ in March 2023, stating that there were only 2.65 million unclosed short positions. Next Bridge Hydrocarbons published a press release directly contradicting FINRA, stating financial institutions have called them looking to buy shares to balance their books, and that **1 single financial institution admitted their shareholder imbalance was multiples more than the number FINRA stated on their FAQ**:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6lim6tvfoxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8495b79086ee0d453f91c742d7649a050e3d0bd\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-6dzaelwj1mxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83130f6ef9ae58cf5d6f1e217f9792ab7d961ad7)\n\nNBH (Next Bridge Hydrocarbons) has also been proactive in trying to get a resolution for shareholders, demanding in a press release that shareholders be given the \"total aggregate outstanding uncovered short positions held by foreign and domestic institutions that exceed the issued and outstanding shares of the company\":\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy37lvqwfoxf1.jpg?width=1177&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fffba4b8f0bd9c183dfb02e7186c9a76fc0c9b7\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-wg185hxk1mxf1.jpg?width=1177&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3add8544a7c8f69fd86965db29220020c16a20d)\n\nIn the meantime, while shareholders and the company were pushing for a resolution, SHFs, etc., were attempting, behind the scenes, to get the company into bankruptcy (that way, they wouldn\'t have to worry about closing their short positions). In addition, many shareholders that were publicly trying to get a resolution in Congress were threatened, smeared, their families were threatened. The CEO of NBH himself, Greg McCabe, [stated in an email that his daughter, his family were receiving threats.](https://x.com/RedHeelzz/status/1874144952604631311)\n\nHe said, verbatim: \"“These attacks started with a vicious social media smear campaign and frivolous lawsuits, but have now escalated to multiple anonymous threats via texts and emails. **They crossed an unforgivable line when they sent a threatening email about me to my daughter-in-law at the private school where she teaches, and they had the audacity to copy every member of the faculty.** My wife taught at this school for 20 years, all four of our children graduated from there, and now two of my grandchildren attend.”\n\nOne MMTLP investor, in particular, Richard Fizzuoglio, someone who walked the halls of Congress to obtain Congressional support towards a resolution, was receiving threats to himself as well as his family to the point that I believe it broke him mentally. He unfortunately ended up....[passing away](https://x.com/KarmaCollects/status/1965113460586684650). Look, this is also a dark story, and as a DD writer who has personally received threats to my family and I (and is aware of other DD writers who have received threats) I very much empathize with this.\n\nIn addition, NBH tried to raise money, but was roadblocked by the previous SEC administration, constantly preventing the company from filing an S-1 by requesting an unreasonable amount of paperwork/revisions to their filings \\[i[t should be noted that this issue has recently been resolved as of October 2025 between NBH and the new SEC](https://x.com/nbhydrocarbons/status/1973496489046581392)\\].\n\nNow, I\'ve personally taken a decent amount of legal classes/read law books, and I know that during the 2008 financial crisis, lawyers had a strategy called \"produce the note\", where they\'d keep requesting documents to delay a foreclosure process. They could commonly successfully delay foreclosure for several years just requesting things, which would help out their client. In this case, if the previous SEC was in bed with SHFs, and they agreed to get NBH bankrupt (especially because a resolution to the MMTLP scandal would completely undermine them and FINRA), it would make sense for them to continually use similar delay tactics to keep NBH from making money.\n\nLastly, in 2024, Next Bridge Hydrocarbons, which is an oil and gas company, \"somehow\" lost an Orogrande lease , a lease to a plot of land that was going to be their primary source of profits. The leaser, University Lands, didn\'t provide an explanation as to why, even though the CEO of NBH [offered 10x the royalties from his previous agreement with them](https://x.com/RedHeelzz/status/1888239101914022363). It\'s an illogical decision from University Lands, which is exactly why I reasonably believe that SHFs, needing NBH to go bankrupt, and knowing their primary source of profits, went out of their way to take the lease away from NBH.\n\nThe NBH CEO, Greg McCabe, [responded in an email regarding the lose of the lease](https://x.com/canwill35/status/1844508585885339655), referring to \"very dark forces at multiple fronts\":\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ukwrmydzfoxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c70538258b75ac456aecbc97dd46f73540e4a6c\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-kwadv9dm1mxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7524ad4e00fda40756ec61f87947b75534d50546)\n\nIt is my strong believe that SHFs employed bad actors to do whatever it takes to break people, harm the company, and do whatever is necessary to sabotage a resolution. Which would make sense, considering their companies are on the line, and I\'ve seen somewhat similar Machiavellian behavior from them towards the GME community since 2021.\n\nAnyways, there were several other tactics SHFs/bad actors have been using to try to get NBH bankrupt, such as vexatious litigation to waste NBH\'s assets via attorney\'s fees (comparable to [when scientology filed 50+ lawsuits against the Cult Awareness Network, which drove them bankrupt, even though most suits were dismissed](https://www.cnn.com/US/9612/19/scientology/index.html?eref=sitesearch#:~:text=Since%201991%2C%2050%20lawsuits%20were,of%20the%20Cult%20Awareness%20Network)), attempting to hijack the community and make shareholders target the CEO instead of SHFs (similar with bad actors trying to get GME shareholders to attack Ryan Cohen), etc. I\'m not going to get in all that other stuff, because it would take forever, and the primary purpose of this DD would be missed.\n\nThat being said, this particular company and its community have been through an extreme amount of hardship, but they are immensely fierce. The amount of effort they put into reaching out to Congressional representatives, filing FOIAs, outreach, filing reports to the OIG/DOJ, and so much more, it has been extraordinary to see this magnitude of resilience. And luckily, the stars have aligned for a resolution, because with the new Presidential Administration, the MMTLP community now has the support from the Executive Branch of the U.S Government.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n**§2: New Presidential Administration Wants Resolution**\n\nThe new Presidential Administration (the Trump Admin) is full of officials and parties that are not only fully aware of the MMTLP situation, but they support a resolution.\n\nI\'ll name a decent number of the ones I\'m aware of:\n\n1. Vice President V.D Vance\n\nHe was among the 100+ members of Congress during 2023-2024 [demanding transparency on MMTLP to the SEC](https://www.crapo.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/mmtlpsecletter09262023.pdf).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjo0ogh2goxf1.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24f367e51e516e946ac9bf733d03f7b1c3bbdcda\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-4vvd9rnn1mxf1.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2659be5c72cdfb606ae553e450af38aaf1722c)\n\n2. Bill Pulte \\[Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Chairman of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\\]\n\nBill Pulte has been publicly vocal of his support towards a resolution towards MMTLP in the past, having spoken about MMTLP [in a space call with Andrew Tate](https://x.com/xMarketNews/status/1799224318238527703) on the matter:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ohiz4y/video/smxt9ouajoxf1/player\n\n3. Andrew Bailey \\[Co-Deputy Director of the FBI\\]\n\nAndrew Bailey has publicly voiced his [support for a resolution to MMTLP](https://x.com/MetaMan1111/status/1957577774501093881). In an interview with the Robb Carter Show, regarding MMTLP, Bailey expressed his disdain to the SEC for not taking initiative towards getting a resolution for shareholders.\n\n4. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \\[U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services\\]\n\nHe [reposted a post on \"X\" regarding MMTLP](https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1838374959741063375), demanding answers from FINRA, while calling FINRA, Gensler, the DTCC, etc., thieves. This was a repost from his official \"X\" account (with millions of followers), which I did consider significant that he would align himself with that position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01823ep4goxf1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06175f31b093198e6bcdd2c6f0ae3e06b61ffe02\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-tatnyqsq1mxf1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84c28ebaf364a05222fd80f561d86bc81420db0)\n\n5. Devin Nunes \\[Chair of the President\'s Intelligence Advisory Board\\]\n\nNunes, when he was working on combatting the naked shorting of President Trump\'s stock (DJT) in 2024, [used MMTLP as an example of another heavily manipulated naked shorted stock](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124021595/ny20026576x11_ex99-1.htm#:~:text=pre%2Dborrow%20logs.-,Such%20an%20inquiry%20is%20needed%20to%20protect%20shareholders%2C%20including%20TMTG\'s,Buchanan%20The%20Honorable%20Greg%20Steube) in a letter to the U.S House on Financial Services Committee:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/44fbqr46goxf1.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53d31ed892ae8defca8519cf9f3555c0e7fb2b0b\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-gertan1s1mxf1.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=483a5568ef81f0233b8fa9ef97f43cd5247cc657)\n\nNunes, in particular, has beef with Citadel, who has naked shorted GME, MMTLP, and DJT. A spokesperson for Citadel Securities [even stated publicly](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/19/citadel-securities-blasts-trump-media-ceo-over-djt-short-sale-letter.html) that, “Devin Nunes is the proverbial loser who tries to blame ‘naked short selling’ for his falling stock price”.\n\nThe company Nunes was previously CEO of, the current President\'s company (Trump Media) also fired back at Citadel Securities, stating: \"**Citadel Securities, a corporate behemoth that has been fined and censured for an incredibly wide range of offenses including issues related to naked short selling, and is world famous for screwing over everyday retail investors at the behest of other corporations, is the last company on earth that should lecture anyone on ‘integrity.’**”\n\nThat, by the way, already shows beef between the current Presidential Administration and Citadel, which is helpful for us, considering that we have a common enemy.\n\n6. U.S President Trump\n\nMultiple sources have confirmed that President Trump is aware of MMTLP (which also makes sense considering Vice President Vance himself signed the MMTLP open letter to the SEC). Although Trump has not made any public announcements regarding MMTLP, because of the naked shorting of his own stock, in addition to the objectives of his backers (which I\'ll explain shortly), he would most certainly be incentivized to use MMTLP as an example to end the naked shorting of his company. Also, based on a credible source, which I\'ll also discuss, it seems that the President is indeed interested in a resolution.\n\nJohn Stubbins, Host of the radio show \"Indivisible\", while discussing subpoenas MMAT sent to Citadel et al., [did further confirm](https://x.com/busybrands/status/1980334129372893533) the President Trump is aware of MMTLP:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ohiz4y/video/8cng7xm7joxf1/player\n\nJohn Stubbins does have strong connections in the political field. He interviewed Former U.S National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn last year. So, he is a credible source when he further confirms that the U.S President is aware of MMTLP.\n\nAlso, in the video he discusses subpoenas sent out to Citadel, Virtu, the DTCC, and others by MMAT. That\'s because MMAT (the company MMTLP was a spinoff from) is also fighting back SHFs with subpoenas for trading data and short shares. Not everyone accepted the subpoenas. Citadel and friends are fighting them in court currently, so it would be pre-mature to say we\'ve successfully uncovered smoking guns there, but these are subpoenas that have successfully been issued to multiple entities, and some of the entities are caving in while others are currently fighting to quash it. Either way, [MMAT is definitely on the offensive](https://x.com/palikaras/status/1897832722728390947):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8v93zp8goxf1.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=769b086e99aba1052e4370c5ac55ec07cbcd1266\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-qdvs8q0u1mxf1.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9166f53d232afbfb4c45bde3bd2bbf69272fbf7c)\n\nI did notice in particular that a prominent shill that had consistently been bashing MMTLP and demeaning the community, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino, [deleted every single post related to MMTLP](https://x.com/KarmaCollects/status/1915958851905720649) (which were negative posts towards MMTLP) on his social media a couple months after President Trump\'s inauguration. It\'s not entirely conclusive why he did it, but reasonable inferences can be made:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gvhl2x9goxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a9e621d9ab60af424b687bb92358839ab403c96\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-9d5unj3w1mxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2983f0a28d57794eeaf47038c91405b62f31dd65)\n\nNow, regarding the support at the Executive Branch of the federal government, note that this is on the federal level. There\'s many other public officials at the federal, state, and local level that have also voiced support for a resolution.\n\nFurthermore, the Heritage Foundation, a strong backer/influencer of the current President and his policies (also known for its \"Project 2025\" initiative), [called for FINRA to be abolished](https://www.fa-mag.com/news/conservative-manifesto-project-25-says-finra-should-be-abolished-78740.html); this is one of their listed objectives.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvkb525cgoxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38968c5462d3cdf4a987fb4935c7267aa02ac708\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-cep9pdwy1mxf1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f38e4f965b47b0590b355c8c935f43d3c0dc133)\n\nMultiple shareholders, including lawyers fighting for a resolution, took FINRA to court, but failed every time because FINRA has \"absolute immunity\", which is a shield they\'ve consistently used in court.\n\nFINRA even stated in a response to a shareholder\'s suit that even if what they did was illegal, they were protected by absolute immunity:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n98rncnegoxf1.jpg?width=812&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02becdda0e46e76782c366d27d7a55101ce592ff\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-m0um68702mxf1.jpg?width=812&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dbc6d2ac7ff02286fcf98085516b849980c4dc8)\n\nFINRA has been arguably the largest obstacle for a resolution (at least on the judiciary/legal side). If the Heritage Foundation accomplishes their objective of abolishing FINRA, that obstacle would completely disappear (excellent for MMTLP, GME, and shareholders of all naked shorted stocks).\n\nHowever, it appears that the Heritage Foundation may use the MMTLP situation as an excuse to demonstrate FINRA\'s incompetence and a perfectly good reason for why FINRA is useless and should be abolished, so there is definitely a mutually beneficial relationship there.\n\nThe support at the Executive Branch is so strong that a highly credible source, a prominent MMTLP liaison with the Trump Administration, Kurtis, has stated that he\'s \"extremely optimistic\" about a favorable resolution. In a space call on \"X\" in October 2025, he went as far as to say that **there\'s going to be a favorable outcome to the MMTLP situation regardless of whether shareholders do anything at this point**.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ohiz4y/video/kg23hq15koxf1/player\n\nSo, yes, the support for a resolution has never been stronger (much stronger than last year, and that was when 100+ members of Congress were demanding transparency from the SEC about MMTLP). And that shift in support compared to the previous Administration is clearly visible with the recent granting of FOIA requests.\n\nRegarding FOIA requests made by MMTLP shareholders since 2022, the only one granted in the beginning was the email from Sam Draddy from FINRA (posted in \"Golden Treasure Part I\") confirming that MMTLP was on their fraud radar and being bluesheeted. Apparently, the granting of that FOIA request was an accident of their part, **because after that email got out, virtually every single other FOIA request was getting denied**.\n\nI\'ll put this into perspective. according to \"FOIAsearch.com\", out of the 1,277 FOIA requests made, only 2 were granted in full (only approx. 0.157% of all requests were granted in full):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rem8m2zggoxf1.png?width=1322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0b3397220d98836f68d93019351db7371b42a57\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-34fnq4r12mxf1.png?width=1322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53bcf208b42a1971069ea7026750d4541b6b3e29)\n\nFair to say that the MMTLP community was hitting a roadblock with the previous Administration regarding FOIA requests. But, with the advent of the new Administration, that appears to have changed, because FOIA requests related to MMTLP have started getting granted again.\n\nFOIA requests relating to electronic communications sent by [Gary Gensler](https://x.com/NicholasRaia2/status/1920134505496502358) and [Hester Pierce](https://x.com/NicholasRaia2/status/1979211147699245422) around the time MMTLP was U3 Halted by FINRA in December 2022 were recently granted, and they demonstrate that there were an \"unusual\" number of meetings and requests to chat right before the stock got halted due to extraordinary events, further confirming that there was most certainly a lot going on behind the scenes that shareholders didn\'t see.\n\nThese text messages specifically said that there was \"a lot going on\", and a few weeks before MMTLP was scheduled to go private and shorts were supposed to close (before MMTLP was U3 Halted), Gensler told Pierce that there was an \"emerging matter\" that they needed to talk about:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ohiz4y/video/pve5k1ewjoxf1/player\n\nWhat\'s also important here is that **these FOIA requests never would\'ve been approved by the previous administration**. So, you can see with your own eyes that the New Administration is significantly more supportive than the previous one (especially taking into account the SEC announced the retirement of Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, the guy that was essentially rejecting all the previous FOIA requests).\n\nAnother highly critical piece of information that can be derived from the FOIA release of Gensler\'s emails are that they [completely contradict the SEC OIT\'s](https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-oig-review-587-2025.pdf) (Office of Information Technology) January 2024 report to the Office of Inspector General that Gensler\'s text messages between October 18, 2022- September 6, 2023 were \"inadvertently deleted\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpfmib3jgoxf1.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91861187ae9da85b0c99ae05cde0c0dbf684b0be\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-bvdsfui32mxf1.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58999a4db9e7785685e3352cf573d4becdf41383)\n\nIt was also [reported by Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-loses-nearly-gary-gensler-100215746.html) in relation to MMTLP:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43qiccwjgoxf1.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59ed91def82cd3b51cba46d8e7a274fcff2db86b\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-golden-treasure-part-ii-100-proof-apes-get-paid-v0-bz3ue6wg2mxf1.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99087f506f500291c29ec8c8ada36ac256f7231e)\n\nWell, guess what, the New Presidential Administration just threw the previous SEC Chair and Admin under the bus, because the granted FOIAs indisputably prove that was a blatant lie from the SEC OIT trying to cover their tracks. This reinforces the high degrees of optimism for a resolution via the Executive Branch by the credible sources mentioned.\n\nIt does look like when the resolution for MMTLP does come, that Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler will end up being the fall guy (or at least one of the fall guys).\n\nSo where does this all leave GME? Upon a resolution to MMTLP, GME will be in the prime position for MOASS.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n**§3: Post-Resolution Opens Gates for GME Resolution**\n\nAt this point, I shouldn\'t have to explain how much of a juggernaut Gamestop\'s position is. The company is insanely undervalued [based on the cash on hand alone](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638025000075/gme-20250802.htm). Even if you disregard the cash raised from the convertible notes, GameStop has several billions in net cash. And the warrants were a win-win for shareholders as well as GameStop, because next time this stock has a run up, every warrant that gets executed is extra profits for GameStop. GameStop could theoretically make nearly $2 billion extra in profits from the warrants alone.\n\nThis company can\'t go bankrupt; hence, SHFs are trapped. They\'re not shorting GME to make money like in 2020. They\'re shorting because they need to survive. If they don\'t short GME, they\'ll end up bankrupt, so it\'s a losing game for them. It\'s not like with other basket stocks, where the companies are struggling with debt and SHFs can bankrupt them to avoid closing their shorts. There\'s no out, and this is exactly why you see the market cap is insanely low compared to the cash on hand. **The average company on the Russell 1000 has a market cap around 10x of its cash on hand (and that\'s a conservative estimate)**.\n\nYou don\'t have to take my word for it. Go search up companies on the Russell 1000, and you\'ll see that their cash on hand is a fraction of their market cap. Whereas GameStop\'s market cap is around 1.2x cash on hand (around 2x if you want to exclude the convertible notes/liabilities). It\'s extremely undervalued, and everyone here knows why. But, when MMTLP gets resolved, it sets a precedent. We\'ll have a a blueprint for a resolution (which we may not even need).\n\nI created a general diagram to explain how MMTLP will ultimately affect GME post-resolution ([feel free to go through it if you\'d like](https://imgur.com/Lv1vKGz)).\n\nThe current President is confirmed to (1) have beef with Citadel, (2) have problems with his own stock being naked shorted by SHFs, and (3) have backers that want regulatory agencies held accountable, or even abolished \\[referring to FINRA\\]. This is the perfect time where the stars are aligning, and if MMTLP gets a settlement, if the MMTLP synthetics get exposed, the same can absolutely happen for GME. The gates open for us. If anything, GME may be next in line after MMTLP gets a settlement, because of the history, the massive army of shareholders, and national attention this stock has already received in the past. We are in an extremely good position. And I am confident that once this stock is resolved via a settlement, it will expose the naked shorts problem infesting the market, and at that point everyone will begin looking at GME and securing a settlement as well.\n\nSee you on the moon! 🦍🚀🌑', '-einfachman-', 'Superstonk', 'https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ohiz4y/the_golden_treasure_part_ii_100_proof_apes_get/', 7860, 377, '2025-10-27 22:23:54', '2025-11-07 23:43:29');

OOP is** u/feelguud\n\n**Originally posted to** r/relationship_advice\n\n**My husband\'s [M32] \"sabbatical\" has become pathetic and I [F30] want it to end right now.**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!emotional manipulation, drug use, possible hostile workplace, depression, verbal abuse, mental health struggles, financial struggles!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ajpisv/my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become_pathetic/): **January 25, 2019**\n\nWe\'re both early 30s, married, no kids. We own a house together (mortgage).\n\nMy husband worked for the same company for almost a decade. He earned a good salary, but the last few years were rough on him thanks to his overbearing boss. He discussed quitting every so often, and I was open to the idea as long as he had another job lined up.\n\nWell last year, he quit spur-of-the-moment over a seemingly minor dispute at work. He would later call it \"the straw that broke the camels back\". No other jobs lined up, nothing. He assured me that he had savings he could live on and that he wanted to take some time to \"re-calibrate\". He also \'had a few business ideas\' he wanted to pursue before getting back into the workforce. Trying to be a supportive partner, I said okay...\n\nFast forward to today -- he has no income and literally hasn\'t sent out a single job application. He hasn\'t even updated his resume. What has he been doing these passed 8 months, you ask? Smoking weed, a bunch of scammy \'work-from-home\' bullshit that hasn\'t made him a dime, and most recently, trying to become an \'Instagram Influencer\'. Yes, seriously.\n\nTo be fair, he has also done some handy-work around the house and fixed up some things. But for the most part, he spends his days smoking weed and dicking around on Instagram, and I\'m effectively subsidizing it -- we used to split bills 50/50, now it\'s more like 80/20.\n\nThe last time I tried to have a serious talk about his future plans, he \"jokingly\" said I could divorce him and pay him alimony if I didn\'t like the current situation. Then he broke down and wept, saying that he might be depressed. I felt horrible for him and offered him my full support, but in retrospect, I\'m curious if it was just a convenient excuse to pivot the conversation and get me off his back.\n\nWhat would you do in my shoes? I have grown resentful of him and this whole situation.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** If he thinks he has depression then he needs to see a doctor and get help. It only gets harder alone, I\'d see how that goes first, because it might get him back to his feet. If he declines that and won\'t change, you can\'t change him.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Ugh that\'s a whole other issue. He read some book last year and now he \"doesn\'t believe\" in anti-depressants (or thinks that they\'re way over-prescribed).\n&gt; \n&gt; When he told me he was depressed and I suggested seeing a doctor, he said no -- he\'ll figure it out himself and to just help be there for him.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Honestly he sounds more like a punk then a grown man lol. It\'s one thing to not work if your a stay at home parent, etc... A completely other thing if your just a lazy bum.\n\nDudes taking advantage of the situation and quite frankly you.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** He wasn\'t always like this. He was responsible and hardworking before he quit. But I agree, I feel like I\'m being taken advantage of now.\n\n**Commenter 3:** In your shoes I would:\n\n\\* get him to undertake a specific plan for job applications;\n\n\\*apply for at least 5 jobs a day, and prove to you that he does so;\n\n\\*alternatively, immediately enroll into relevant further education; or\n\n\\*leave\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I thought of this too, giving him tasks and \'checking in\' on his progress. But it\'s not the way our relationship has ever worked. Frankly, it sounds like something a parent would do with their child, not one spouse to another.\n\n**Commenter 4:** \n\n&gt; Trying to become an ‘Instagram Influencer’\n\nNope dump him\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Honestly this part is very annoying and what\'s caused me to actually seek help with my relationship. His ego and mood are wrapped up in his Instagram thing, it\'s all he\'s talked about for weeks now. He\'ll \"lose followers\" after a post and get moody about it. It\'s pathetic and I\'ve just had enough.\n\n**Is OOP working?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I work full-time. I make a decent income but if my husband can\'t contribute anything toward our monthly expenses, I don\'t make enough to cover them totally myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/alro8i/update_my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become/): **January 31, 2019 (six days later)** \n\nFirst, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. A lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.\n\nOn the day I made my last post, my husband and I had a talk that night when I got home from work. I basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. He repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.\n\nThen I moved onto finances. I asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was \"enough\". I pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn\'t answer. I asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. When I asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.\n\nI told him that the current arrangement wasn\'t working, and that he\'d have to start paying 50% of the bills on March 1st. At this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. He wouldn\'t even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as I talked. I doubt he even heard a word I said, but I clearly stated all the other issues I had -- the Instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc.\n\nAfter this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. For almost a week now he\'s slept in the basement. He basically doesn\'t leave the basement when I\'m home unless it\'s to get food. Honestly, it\'s pathetic.\n\nI am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. I also have a coffee date planned for Sunday with my best friend -- I am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. Because honestly, this isn\'t the life I want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. I am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.\n\nThanks again for reading and giving your input.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** He sounds extremely depressed, ashamed and embarrassed of himself\n\n**Commenter 2:** your husband is clinically depressed and needs to see a doctor. this is a mental health issue that only gets worse, and the marijuana is a part of the feedback loop. he needs professional treatment as soon as possible.\n\n**Commenter 3:** How long has this marriage been going on?? It seems like you’re used to everything being 50/50. But it’s not how it always is in reality I’m not saying put up with this shit. But your husband is clearly in a bad place and needs help. The way you explained confronting him about all of this sounds, to him, like an attack. We know it isn’t, but it’s probably how he felt. And 9 times out of 10 he KNOWS you’re 100% right. It sucks to hear the truth! And it also sucks to feel like a complete failure then be told every way how you’re completely failing. Both my fiancé and I felt this way when we had to essentially switch off on taking care of the responsibilities. it was embarrassing having to depend on him and it was unbelievably embarrassing for him as the man in the relationship. We had countless difficult and emotional talks about this.\n\nAgain, I’m not saying put up with this because you’re married. I’m only commenting because of the fact that you seem to be really focused of this “50/50” thing and I personally feel like marriage isn’t always going to be 50/50. Sometimes it’s 49/51 and sometimes it’s 8/92. Does he contribute to the household at all?? Like does he cook, clean, do laundry, finish home projects, runs house errands?? Or do you also take on those responsibilities? (If you’re also doing all of this. It’s extremely unacceptable and he is taking advantage of this situation) But again, I’m not telling you to deal with his behavior! Just trying to help find a solution. You know your limits better than anybody else! Don’t forget that!!\n\n**Commenter 4:** If he won’t seek help, he’s choosing to check out of the marriage. He’s turning into a different person and since he refuses to talk about the credit cards, who knows what he could be doing to your credit.\n\nEdit: what is OP supposed to do? This has been going on for 8 months according to her prior post. She can’t force him into treatment, you can only involuntarily admit someone if they’re currently a danger to themselves or others. If he’s hostile to her and refusing help, that’s his personal decision. He does retain some accountability here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #2 (rareddit)](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b4nxbu/update_2_my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become/): **March 23, 2019 (nearly two months later)** \n\nThanks again to all who responded to my prior thread, even if I didn\'t agree with the characterization of my relationship by many of the commenters. I did take some advice to heart though, including not sharing my husbands issues with my friends.\n\nMy husband continues to sleep in the basement. I asked him a few times to start sleeping in our bed again, he\'d say \"maybe\" but never actually do it. We have stopped having sex entirely, but I have heard him watch porn in the basement.\n\nOn the morning of March 1st, we had a horrible argument when I asked for his half of the monthly bills. He e-transfered me about 2/3 what he should have, and when I asked for the rest he exploded. He just kept saying \"fuck off\" louder and louder, over and over as I tried to say that he needed to contribute his fair share.\n\nThen he started talking about his depression again. Literally the only time he will up his \"depression\" is when I\'m criticizing his shitty life choices. He hasn\'t even seen a doctor or been diagnosed, yet he uses it like a \"get out of jail free card\" to be totally unproductive and not pay bills.\n\nSo I told him point blank: \"either see a doctor for your depression and start fixing your life, or this marriage is over\". It sounded so harsh but those are honestly the only two options at this point. He made some quip about me paying him alimony if I divorced him (not the first time he\'s said this) and that was the last we spoke of it.\n\nWe have briefly seen and talked to each other since then, but there\'s no warmth there anymore. It\'s like we\'re roommates. Last week he told me he booked a doctors appointment and I was happy for him, but as far as I can tell he never ended up going (even after I offered to take the day off and drive him to the appointment). I don\'t think he\'s left the house in over 2 months. I have stopped cooking him meals so he now subsists on instant noodles he bought off Amazon.\n\nI met with a divorce lawyer for the first time earlier this week. He was excellent and gave me a comprehensive rundown of all my options. When I told him about my husband\'s alimony comments, he laughed and said \"not a chance\". He voluntarily quit his job against my wishes, he has no official diagnosis from a doctor that would preclude him from working... I don\'t know where he got it in his head that he\'d be entitled to alimony from me.\n\nI am holding on to a shred of hope that my husband will put forth some kind of effort to get better and repair our relationship. I pray every night that he\'ll do a complete 180 and start being his normal self again. But if nothing changes, I plan to meet with my lawyer again sometime in early April and officially file for divorce.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Your ultimatum was appropriate.\n\nBut since he\'s not changing, now you have to carry it through.\n\n**Commenter 2:** You did all that you could. In fact, this might be the best thing for your husband as well.\n\nGetting out of the cycle of depression is incredibly difficult without therapy or a drastic change. Losing his wife and having to live alone without an income might just be enough to make him seek help.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I’m sorry about all this.\n\nDon’t hold out too much hope. Good on you for taking charge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #3 (rareddit)](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccaods/update_3_my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become/): **July 12, 2019 (nearly four months later)** \n\nFirst, thanks to those who left comments in my prior posts. Hearing advice from all angles really helped me make practical, informed decisions during this extremely volatile time in my life.\n\nThe TL;DR version is that we are separated, with plans to divorce in 1 year.\n\nI finally got him to see a doctor. I wasn\'t in the room for the diagnosis, but the doctor suggested my husband look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and SSRIs. Of course, my husband was opposed to both -- he could \"read about CBT online\" and I\'ve known for a while that he\'s outright hostile to the idea of taking anti-depressants. (he describes them as \"brain warping\")\n\nWe had a week or so in April where things almost felt normal. We talked more, ate dinner together, slept in the same bed together, even had a date/movie night. I felt so hopeful, things truly seemed to be getting better. It didn\'t last though, we had a fight about something completely innocuous and things quickly fell apart again.\n\nOne day after work, I sat in my car and was completely overcome with dread. The thought of going home to my broken relationship... it was too much. I drove around aimlessly for hours, wondering how in God\'s name my life had turned out like this. Half the time I was sobbing, I must have looked crazy. This was my breaking point. I was done with the relationship and the marriage for good.\n\nWhen I told him my decision, he wept openly (as did I). He said he was sorry but that he understood. He didn\'t ask me to reconsider or make any effort to save the relationship, which tells me it was right decision for both of us. He moved into his parents basement a few weeks ago.\n\nI am still in a rough place emotionally. I pray that time will heal me and that I\'ll be able to find love again\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** It’s one thing to have depression, but it’s another one entirely to get a diagnosis and then refuse treatment.\n\nI’m actually glad he moved back in with his parents, as they can keep an eye on him and make sure he’s okay — or as okay as possible. If you’re on good terms with them, you may want to tell them some of your concerns about him.\n\n**Commenter 2:** You are both relatively young and have no children. The fact that when you verbalised your decision to divorce, there was no confrontation or mention of attempting reconciliation is telling. Honestly this is probably the best outcome for both of you. Him living with his parents means that there will be someone looking out for him whilst he sorts out his issues and you will have the space and freedom to move on with your life. Good luck to you.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Sad that its come to this. But it seems like the natural conclusion for so many relationships. Even in cases where one party does try to become better, the other party ends up checking out at some point and the relationship ends anyway.\n\nYour husband is an adult and has made some choices, for better or for worse and he has to face those consequences. I\'m truly sorry your marriage has ended, but I think we can both agree that your future lies down a different path.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Editor\'s note: marking this inconclusive as OOP hasn\'t updated in six years now**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o65k70/my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become_pathetic/', 7656, 796, '2025-10-14 10:04:08', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

OOP is u/Zealousideal_Ear7529**\n\n**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**\n\n**AITA For filing a police report on a good friend who was caught on video stealing my boyfriend\'s camera at a dinner? She has refused to help me either replace it in full or contribute to the cost of replacing it.**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!gaslighting!&lt;\n\n**Mood Spoilers:** &gt;!infuriating!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/LYWQi0Lgff): **September 17, 2025**\n\nMore context: \n\nWe were out to dinner one night at an expensive hotel. My boyfriend let me borrow his Canon G7X (1800) camera to bring to take pictures with my friends. At the conclusion of the dinner, I went up to the room and realized the camera was gone. I went back right down to the table and no one had seen it. \n\nI immediately got with hotel security and she is on video, clear as day, swiping the camera when my back was turned and shoving it in her purse. I covered for her initially with my friend, and contacted her to find a resolution. She had taken the camera with her and my other friends to a club after dinner, which I did not attend, and lost it there. \n\nFor background, this is my good college friend who I know well (the camera thief). She has been taken on free trips to Coachella and St Barths on my dime (not kidding), as well as many other things. We have done a lot together and are good friends, so I expected her to feel sorry. \n\nInitially she lied, saying she did not have it. When I told her we had video, she confessed and then said yes she took it but lost it at the next bar she went to with my other friends. It is now gone. I asked her to help me replace it by going in on me with the cost. She has refused all measured or resolutions, and now I feel I have nothing left to do but file a police report and let them handle it. It is impacting my relationship, and I am furious my friend is not helping at all. \n\nWhy should I be on the hook for something she stole? I have given her three weeks to help me resolve this, but she insists she is going to do nothing. I am being pressed by my boyfriend to either replace the camera or help him file a report with her info and the footage. I even asked her to just throw in half or less than half the cost to help, but she still refuses. I do not want her to get in trouble, but I am at the point where I feel she really does not care.\n\n**Verdict: Asshole** *(Editor\'s Note: the POO mode was amended for this post)*\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** YTA - Is there a reason you are choosing your thieving friend over your boyfriend? She’s made it clear she’s not your friend, and that she’s not going to make this right.\n\nThe police report should have been filed the moment she said she wasn’t going to pay for it.\n\nIf I were your boyfriend I would be reconsidering the relationship with you over this. You’re really dragging your feet to make this right. Get the report made and replace his camera.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** This is how I am starting to feel. You are right and thank you for the honest words.\n\n+\n\n&gt; I just hate to get anyone in trouble, I think I may be the asshole because if I wanted to I could have paid out of pocket and resolved it for everyone\n\n**Commenter 2:** YTA - not even sure why you are asking, I have rarely seen a post with more assholish behavior on here. You are an asshole to your BF, kind guy trusted you with something valuable and you are not even giving him all information you have after it got swiped. You brought your asshole friend to this dinner, you are an asshole for not filing a report, you are an asshole to yourself for not holding this fucking \"friend\" accountable... what the hell do you mean : \"throwing in half\" ? Get your head out off your ass and go file a report. Make sure your BF is made whole, be utterly embarrassed with your own behavior here, and do better next time.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I know. I just didn\'t want to get her in trouble, I feel I could have paid for it myself and resolved for everyone. She is also in our friend group we have had forever and it will cause ripples\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 3:** I’d break up with you this tbh. Not wanting to cause ripples. You’re causing them in your relationship. Hopefully he leaves you after you keep showing you aren’t on his side.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** I am a good boyfriend to him. We love each other. It is just a weakness in my character that I give people the benefit of the doubt. Clearly something I need to work on. I just really try to give people the beenfit of the doubt especially those I am close with\n\n**OOP clarifies on the location of the security cameras after realizing his BF\'s camera was missing once OOP went up to his room**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Wrong. I went up to my room where my BF was. He asked where his camera was. I went right down to the salon where we were eating and it was gone and no staff had seen it after clearing our table.\n\n+\n\n&gt; This is what prompted me to have security check the cameras, which they had in the dining room.\n\n **Commenter 4:** Genuine question: are you a particularly insecure person? Don’t mean that as an insult. Asking because that’s the only way I could see someone trying to make amends with this “friend.” She’s not your friend. She’s using and taking advantage of you. And it sounds like she’s been doing so for a long time.\n\nThere are better people out there. You need to start respecting and treating yourself better. Otherwise your willingness to go out on a limb for the wrong people will jeopardize your relationships with the right people. I’m sure you can see how this can quickly turn into a self-destructive cycle.\n\nReport her to the police and cut her out of your life like. And if you aren’t already, I’d talk to a therapist to better understand why you feel so compelled to protect this relationship.\n\nSoft YTA to yourself and your boyfriend.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I agree with you, and this is an issue I do have. You are right here. I am a people pleaser at my own expense\n\n**Additional Information from OOP after reading comments**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I feel guilty because I gave her time to fix it and she made me look like an idiot. I also feel guilty because I know if I could swing it right now I would have replaced it myself. I just cannot at this moment buy a 2k camera.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Editor\'s note: all of the updates were made in comments, but also edited into the original post**\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1njeb4g/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/nepxor7/): **September 17, 2025 (same day, one hour later)** \n\nUPDATE: I sent her a text this AM telling her if I do not receive full cost of the camera or shipping confirmation of a new camera from an approved vendor to a provided address by end of day Friday, we will be filing a report with the police Saturday AM. I felt like an asshole typing this out to her, but I have to do it.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Why would you even borrow this camera to begin with? A G7 X is a glorified point-and-shoot camera. At the cost of $1800. Why wouldn’t you just use your cell phone? I know this isn’t the point, but you borrowed something expensive and then lost it around people you cant trust and it wasn’t something you even needed to use.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes, you are right. In my defense, I borrowed it from the hotel room we were in to meet them at the hotel restaurant. I never intended to leave property with it. Boyfriend stayed in room upstairs when I went to meet friends. Thinking was take a few pics on it and bring it back upstairs when done.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Wow, your update makes you even more of an AH! Just go to the police station and file a report! You are going to keep giving her line to hang you with.\n\nDon\'t be surprised when your bf dumps you after he is made whole for the cost of the camera.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I did that because I had a feeling it would be resolved if I made it clear action would be taken. One way or the other\n\n**Commenter 3:** My take is that the friend stole the camera because she wanted it. Not \"just to take a few extra pics\" after OP went home, as she claimed.\n\nShe didn\'t lose it, as she first claimed : IMO she still has it, even after all the drama that\'s already happened. Police is what that girl deserves, and need.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** This is starting to feel what it is. I do not know if you are familiar, but this camera even at full price is out of stock. Girls COVET it because it is known as the best \"instagram camera\". I think she took it, and hoped I would replace it\n\n**OOP should be making this up to his boyfriend**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Bought him some golden goose shoes, dinner, and some clothes :) I feel awful. I am glad this happened. I am done being used my friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1njeb4g/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/ner537y/): **September 17, 2025 (same day, three hours later from the last update)** \n\nUPDATE X2: She told me she is sick of me and that I will be receiving a tracking number by 12 eastern on friday and not to blame her if the package is never receieved. I told her if she was my real friend, she would be sorry and in no way will I allow this to be flipped on me. Should I ask if the camera is new, or the one that \"Disappeared\"?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1njeb4g/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/neu2zys/): **September 18, 2025 (next day)** \n\nUpdate X3: She sent me a tracking number via FEDEX. It says it is awaiting package. I have asked her repeatedly if she is sending me the original camera, assuming it \"Magically\" turned up, or a new one. She refuses to answer and only tells me to stop bothering her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1njeb4g/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/new667e/): **September 18, 2025 (same day, 10 hours later)** \n\nUpdate X4: I am more and more convinced my friend (camera thief) took the camera hoping that I would just replace it for my boyfriend, gifting her a free camera. For background, this friend is heavily involved on Instagram and loves taking pictures. The Canon G7 is COVETED by women because it is known as THE Instagram camera. Even if you wanted to buy one at full price, they are out of stock everywhere. Lets hope it gets returned with this tracking. FEDEX still says awaiting package even though shipping info was sent to them at 7 PM yesterday.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1njeb4g/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/nftpe42/):**September 23, 2025 (five days later)** \n\nUpdate X4: Original Camera returned via fedex the other day. Has been given back to the boyfriend. However, the camera thief blocked me on all socials after this. Appeared she was trying to keep the camera for herself, and expected me to just buy a new one for the BF.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o10gqp/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/', 7464, 407, '2025-10-08 10:00:07', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

I like one more than the other and I\'m having trouble not showing favouritism.**\n\n[Original post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4msixe/me_45f_with_my_daughters17f__16f_i_like_one_more/)  **June 6, 2016**\n\n\nI made this account a while ago to comment on a post, so I figure it\'d be good to use as a throwaway for this.\n\nSo my daughters were born pretty damn close together, their birthdays are only 10 months apart because I got pregnant pretty much immediately after having the other. Their entire lives they have always been best friends. My eldest is Sam (17) and the year below is Izzy (16). These girls have been absolutely inseparable since Izzy was born. They\'d read each other stories, play with their dolls, do each others hair, held hands EVERYWHERE they went together, and they look incredibly alike too, people have mistaken them for twins when they were younger. We\'ve always had a pretty tight knit family; me, husband and the girls, we have family film/game nights and regularly take trips together. These girls are my entire world and I\'m feeling absolutely riddled with guilt over the last two years because I\'m really starting to dislike my youngest, Izzy.\n\nObviously they weren\'t going to stay the same forever, from the age of about 13 onwards was when they both really started to diverge with their personalities. I completely expected and thought I was prepared for this, I can still remember when I first started to feel like I was becoming my own person and I know it\'s a confusing/emotional rollercoaster for teens, so I try to be as open and understanding as possible in regards to their choices.\n\nBoth girls are currently doing their A-levels in college (UK).\n\nSam is studying Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and some kind of animal welfare subject, her goal is to go into veterinary course at Uni, and she currently volunteers at our local vets helping out with the animals. She\'s always been a sweet girly girl, and only got more \"feminine\" as she entered her teenage years. I\'m also rather girly, and me and Sam regularly go get our nails/hair done together, go shopping, and enjoy baking together. At the end of each day at school she\'ll come home and make us both a cup of tea, and we\'ll chat about how our days went, boys she\'s interested in her classes, drama with her friends etc. She\'s by no means the \"popular girl\" at school but has a group of about 10 close knit friends that she hangs out with a lot, and often the girls will sleep over at my house, do each others make up, even join us on our movie nights. Sam is by no means shy, but hates making people upset so will avoid confrontation like the plague.\n\nIzzy on the other hand has begun to get very involved in political issues and current events. She lives off of the news channel, and is always passionate about some cause or another. She gets along rather well with her father in this aspect as they like to debate about the government &amp; upcoming policies. She means well in her arguments but can be a bit opinionated at times, and when someone disagrees with her instead of calling peace and agreeing to disagree she likes to keep the discussion going until she understands why someone thinks like they do. I understand that she\'s curious about how the world works and I won\'t squash that, but it does get a bit tedious hearing \"but WHY\" to everything we talk about. She\'s currently studying Politics, Psychology, Business and Economics as her A level subjects. She doesn\'t really have any friends from school, and lives on websites like tumblr chatting to people who care about her \"causes\". I try to involve her in mine and Sam\'s trips out shopping and she declines, saying she\'d rather stay at home.\n\nTo try and be more inclusive I suggested she picks some activities and we\'ll do them with her if she doesn\'t like the girlie activities, but Izzy will again decline saying she\'d rather hang out with people who have the same mindset as her. I tried to organise something with just me and her to do instead so I had alone time with her just like I do for Sam, but she responded with something along the lines of \"like you\'d be able to understand anything I\'m involved with anyway\". Her most recent thing has been the \"free the nipple\" campaign along with growing out her leg hair, and has been ranting at Sam for being a \"slave to gender sterotypes\" by liking dresses and boys and makeup. At our movie nights Izzy will try and \"psycho-analyse\" the characters in all the films, even one\'s she\'s picked, and complains about the character tropes and forced romances throughout them. It\'s completely ruined movie nights, so last week I didn\'t even schedule one so I didn\'t have to deal with it. I know Sam is upset by all of this because she\'s cried to me a few times, but each time I bring it up to Izzy she says she doesn\'t care and we should \"check our privilege\"? I\'ve tried grounding (she just sat stubbornly on the floor all night), suspending her allowance (she said money doesn\'t control her), taking her phone away from her (she says we let technology control our lives anyway) and nothing seems to work.\n\nI hate it because I want to love my daughters equally but I really don\'t like Izzy right now? She\'s being a bit self-righteous policing everything her sister Sam wears/says/does and calling her a slave. My husband seems to think it\'s just \"some silly teenage rebellious phase\" and she\'ll calm down soon so he\'s not as upset about it as I am. He also enjoys political debates with her, so he tries to \"take the heat away\" from the discussions when me or Sam are present. One time when Izzy openly called Sam \"subordinate arm candy\" when she was going out on a date he told her she\'s not allowed to talk to her sister like that and she was grounded, and Izzy snapped \"oh now you\'re playing favourites too? fuck off then\" and stormed upstairs. He\'s been trying to talk to her calmly about her attitude and how he loves her, and he understands her side of things, but can\'t just be this rude to everyone, but he recently got a new project at work and has been working long ass shifts so he\'s not around that often.\n\nI just don\'t know what to do! Is this a phase? How do you even deal with this? If anything her behaviour is making me like Sam even more for being such a good kid and so I feel like it\'s a never ending cycle. I have tried to include Izzy in so many things and she just debates any topic possible tells me all my choices are wrong. Sam will be off to Uni in September and then it\'ll just be me and Izzy at home, how the heck do I navigate this?\n\ntldr: Youngest kid Izzy (16F) is very politically charged and argumentative, and I\'m starting to dislike her personality. How do I get along with her and stop playing favourites?!\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**littlewoolie**\n\n&gt; One of the most important debate/relationships tools to teach Izzy is: \"Once you start name-calling, you\'ve lost your argument\"\n&gt;\n&gt; Debates and jokes are fun until someone else gets hurt.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;That could be a good tool. Usually because she gets so passionate about these things I end up trying to calm her down and justify her because I think she might feel like it\'s me and Sam vs her opinions. The next time she insults someone I think I\'ll definitely try just ending the discussion on the spot and doing something different.\n\n**~**\n\n**BSCD95**\n\n&gt; It\'s great Izzy is passionate but she needs to seriously learn some respect. She should not talk to anyone in your family the way she does. She should not be telling her father to fuck off or being extremely rude to her sister, not to mention how dismissive she is of you. She acts like you won\'t understand her interests, insinuating that you\'re stupid.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would take away all her privileges, no phone, no internet, grounded, etc until she can be more respectful. Also please reassure Sam that it is okay that she likes being a stereotypical girl. The whole point of feminism is that a woman can be whatever she wants to be, not that she can be whatever she wants to be with the exception of being \"traditionally feminine\". Keep up your time with her and ride out the storm with Izzy, hopefully this will pass when she matures a little.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; That\'s what I try to do but considering they\'re polar opposites right now I don\'t know if they\'re taking me seriously or if they think I\'m just saying it to make them feel better?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It\'s like I\'m turning back and forth going \"If you wanna give up bras Izzy, go ahead! Who needs them! It\'s great you feel confident enough to go out without them.\" \"Wearing bras doesn\'t make you anti-feminist Sam, a lot of people find them super comfy and easier to wear. Plus there\'s some super pretty ones out there so they make a lot of women feel sexy in them!\" \"No no, Izzy, I\'m not saying women can\'t be sexy without bras.. sorry\"\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to tear my hair out!\n\n**When suggested Izzy needs to get her temper and outbursts under control**\n\n&gt;As I\'ve said in another comment Izzy has just joined a debate team/club one of her classmates just set up at her college, so hopefully she\'ll be able to find a structured way with her peers to debate, learn it isn\'t always about being right, and get some of her frustration out before she returns home and takes it out on me and Sam.\nOthers have been really helpful in sending me lists of films/tv shows that she\'d probably be interested in but I know she\'s always loved reading so the books could be a good idea!\n\n\n[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ps6cl/update_me_45f_with_my_daughters_17f__16f_i_like/)  **June 25, 2016 (19 days later)**\n\nSo I know it\'s only been about 3 weeks since the last post. Already a lot has happened, and there\'s probably a lot more work to do but I just want to thank everyone for their advice and let you know that progress has been made! (LONG)\n\nIt was clear from all the comments that there were a few issues I had to deal with. \n1 was to actually involve myself more in Izzy\'s life and interests, and 2 was to stop letting her get away with hurting Sam so much and teach her that she can\'t talk down at people like she is. 3 is to ride it out as much as I can and hope that she mellows out over time like a lot of commenters said they did as they aged.\n\nSo the first thing I did was make a list of all the films/tv shows recommended by people here to look in to, to try and find some things I can watch with Izzy to make her feel included. It was a LONG list and I think we got some really good options that will appeal to the whole family! The first thing I tried out is Steven Universe as just about everyone on here suggested it for me. Izzy actually walked in on me watching it about 5 episodes in (so much for 1 taster episode to see if it was any good) and sort of paused in the doorway and asked \"You.. actually like steven universe?\" I said one of my coworkers had recommended it as a cute show to watch and I actually kinda love it. Oh I wish I could have taken a picture of the smile on her face. She immediately jumped onto the sofa and started quizzing me on how far along I am, who my favorites are, if I liked this show then I\'ll love X and started listing off other shows (a lot of which were on my list to try out).\n\nI told her we could try all them out, I actually already have a few, and reinstate film night - BUT under a new condition to make sure we don\'t run into any issues again. I purchased some dry-wipe boards and pens and proposed the following idea: During all films and tv shows, there is to be silence as I would like to watch something without it being talked over. However we write down questions/topics we want to talk about on the boards throughout the film. At the end of it, we designate a \"discussion time\" to talk all about it. Izzy agreed to it and said that was probably fair, so that was one win! We\'ve had two film nights since then. The first one we watched was legally blonde and she was constantly scribbling on the board. The discussion after went pretty well I feel, Izzy did most of the talking about how empowering Elle Woods is but I tried to engage her so she didn\'t feel like I was just glazed over and ignoring it. Sam has at this point finished her exams and took up her volunteer work pretty much full-time so it was just me and Izzy doing this, which I thought gave some nice quality time.\n\nI tried to find some activities for us to do together that aren\'t hair/nails and thought she might enjoy a hike as we live pretty close to a national park here, so I suggested that one day. I was turned down but that\'s fine, i\'m not expecting an immediate turnover. I\'ll just keep suggesting things every few days to let her know I do want to do things with her. We\'ve been watching orange is the new black since that came out, along with Steven universe and sense 8 now, so I still feel like we\'re making progress.\n\nSince Sam took up the extra work she\'s not really in the house much anymore so her and Izzy have clashed a lot less naturally, I still took down some of the comments you guys suggested (Like how by shaming Sam for what she\'s wearing, Iz is doing the opposite of feminism), but Sam actually beat me to it? So far only 1 has been made when Sam wore a small playsuit out one day as it\'s been getting pretty warm here. Izzy said something like \"Wow, I didn\'t think it was possible to wear any less clothing than you normally do. Who\'s this for then?\" but before I could even say anything Sam went \"Me, because I look damn good in it. Maybe you should try one, it\'s pretty empowering looking this good\" and skipped out the door. I was stood in shock for a second as Sam has never returned fire before, and Iz kinda did the same for a second before storming off upstairs. She hasn\'t made another comment since then (this was shortly after my first post) and I\'m not sure if it\'s because they just don\'t see each other often or Iz was genuinely shut up by one comment from Sam? So I\'m in limbo waiting for that one to come around.\n\nWhile taking Sam out for uni supplies one day I asked her how she feels about Izzy\'s behaviour, because I really don\'t want her to be negatively impacted by all this. She said that she gets a little upset when Iz makes the comments, but she knows that she thinks she\'s coming from a good place and doesn\'t take it to heart. She also said that Iz would probably chill out after a few years and when she goes off to uni she\'ll be away from it anyway, so she\'s \"riding out the storm\" until September.\n\nMe and Sam aside, the new debate group I mentioned in the comments Iz just joined has now become a big thing for her which I also think has been mellowing her out a bit. She\'s been going to sessions quite regularly, I asked her if they had audiences and if I could come along some time and she said \"Maybe in the future, it\'s new right now so it\'s really just class debating\". She\'s also become really close really fast with another girl in the group (we\'ll call her Anna), apparently they take the same subjects but are in opposite classes so they never met before this debate group. Either Anna is at our house or Izzy is at hers every day for the last two weeks so I\'m glad she\'s made a close friend she can talk to - she\'s barely been on her laptop since so there\'s also less of the internet/tumblr fueling her behaviour. Since Anna came along Izzy has been significantly less argumentative and rude, she\'s been skipping around the house in an almost dream-like state and it\'s making my heart melt to see her this happy. I suspect Anna might be slightly more than just a new \"friend\" but I\'m not going to push anything, Izzy can talk to me whenever she wants to.\n\nAs for her dad, his project at work is wrapping up so there\'s now less late nights and they\'re back to the political chit-chat over breakfast and seem as close as ever.\n\nSo overall, I think things are improving. I\'d like to thank everyone that took the time to comment, I read through every single one. I will continue bringing up activities and shows that you\'ve suggested over time, I have a list saved of them all on my computer to keep asking her about. Eventually maybe Izzy will let me take her on a hike or go to see a play together, I just have to keep trying. I\'ll also punish her where appropriate if she calls out me or Sam for what we wear or our hobbies, because it\'s not okay to be rude. It\'s a weird line to walk right now of curbing rude comments while also suddenly making more of an effort to take part in her interests but I think I\'m giving it a good go.\n\nTLDR: I\'m starting to find common ground with Izzy, she\'s made a close friend(?) that is mellowing her out, the debate team has taken off and Sam is standing up for herself.

We have so much in common, he\'s super sweet and always goes the extra mile for me with grand romantic gestures, even asking me out by buying me my favorite comic book and leaving a sticky note between the pages confessing his feelings. I\'ve never gotten anything but amazing vibes from him this whole time until now. However, BF has a childhood friend (27F) I\'ll call Syd. My boyfriend was very upfront when we started dating that he and Syd had romantic feelings for each other in the past but decided it would be best they only stayed friends since they didn\'t want to risk their friendship. I never actually met Syd before and have only heard about her from BF and vice versa.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, my BF texted me, super distraught, telling me that Syd called him, saying that she was too jealous of my and BF\'s relationship and that she couldn\'t stand being BF\'s friend while he was in a happy relationship with me. She basically gave BF an ultimatum of him having to break up with me or she would cut him out of her life. I was baffled by this, thinking that this 27 year old woman, who had mutually agreed with BF that they would never date, was so childish to give him a ridiculous ultimatum and I voiced that to him. He got mad at me, saying \"It\'s not that simple\" and seemed to be seriously considering breaking up with me just to stay friends with Syd.\n\nI was in disbelief that he couldn\'t see how manipulative and abusive this was, and that the obvious conclusion would be to cut her off since she was clearly toxic and controlling, but he was still on the fence and we ended up taking a break and not talking while he \"thought it over\". The next week and a half, he barely talked to me, telling me he\'s in a very hard place while I became increasingly frustrated that this would even be a hard choice. Like, we\'re in a happy relationship, and he\'s debating breaking up because his crazy friend can\'t handle her jealousy? I was fuming.\n\nHe then finally came to me after that time of not talking saying he decided to \"choose me\" and leave his friendship with Syd behind, but by that time I was so mad that it was even a choice that took two whole weeks to decide to begin with that I ended up breaking up with him anyway.\n\nNow his friends are telling me I\'m an asshole for not breaking up with him sooner because now Syd is still cutting him out for picking me over her AND I\'m still leaving him, whereas if I had broken up with him during the weeks he was \"thinking it over\", he would have at least been able to stay friends with Syd. But honestly, I didn\'t even realize how mad I was until he picked me and made it seem like he was some kind of martyr for doing so. AITA?\n\n**Update (Same Post): Date unknown, sometime in the next month**\n\nUPDATE: Apparently, Syd has completely cut EXBF off and blocked him on everything. He is begging me to take him back, even contacting my friends to attempt to convince me (luckily, all my friends are telling him to eff off). He wrote me some 2000 word essay on how I\'m the best thing that ever happened to him and that he was blinded by his happy childhood memories of Syd. I also found out they slept together in the past before we started dating, so that\'s cool! But it was just \"a one night stand\" to \"see what could have been.\"\n\nEither way, he was definitely hiding more about his relationship with Syd than I was told. I don\'t really care anymore. I\'m not taking him back. He\'s a grown-ass man who should have known better than to ghost me for two weeks to \"think it over\" as if things would be the same after he decided to \"pick me\". Doubt anything else interesting will happen but I might update if it does. I\'m honestly just hoping this will be a reality check for him, and he\'ll get the message. At least his friends have stopped bothering me.\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nr5u49/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_let_my_stalker_ex_28m_into/)**: September 26, 2025 (almost 10 months later)**\n\nI (28F) broke up with my ex (28M) ten months ago but he will not get over it. Despite me wishing to no longer interact with my ex, as well me as dating someone new (Cole, 29M), my ex has been trying to win me back by doing over-the-top things like sending me gift baskets, love letters, chocolates, etc even though I\'ve blocked his number, on all social media and always ignore his \"attempts to woo me\" with his gifts. He never actually interacts with me directly. Never waits for me outside or tries to talk to me, he just leaves me gifts at our doorstep and runs away. It\'s creepy and makes me super uncomfortable.\n\nCole, who I live with, doesn\'t actually see an issue with this and says he \"feels bad for my ex\" and \"doesn\'t want me to waste my ex\'s money/efforts\" so I reluctantly just let Cole eat the chocolates and other crap since he insists I don\'t throw them out. He even likes reading the love letters even though I tell him I don\'t want to. I don\'t understand why he\'s so chill about this because my ex and Cole aren\'t even friends and have never interacted, so it makes no sense why he\'s so okay with my ex doing these dumb gestures that he KNOWS make me uncomfortable and creeped out. If anything, Cole should be pissed off that someone is trying to steal his girlfriend, right?\n\nAnyway, all of this finally came to a head on my birthday. After work, I came home to our apartment decorated in balloons, chocolates, and flowers. I\'m immediately touched, thinking all of this was a surprise from Cole.\n\nNOPE.\n\nApparently, my ex actually CAME OVER with all this crap, buzzed our apartment doorbell, Cole LET HIM IN, and allowed my ex to DECORATE OUR APARTMENT AND LEAVE GIFTS FOR ME. Then my ex left before I could get home. Cole apparently saw NO ISSUE WITH THIS. He literally LET MY EX INTO OUR APARTMENT LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL because my ex \"came all the way with all these gifts which was such a thoughtful gesture!\".\n\nNow I feel totally unsafe. What if my ex secretly left a hidden camera or something?! I have no idea why Cole is so fine with all of this! I\'ve talked to him over and over and he won\'t understand why I would want to reject free stuff from someone who cares about me. I love Cole but the fact that he actually let my ex into our apartment was a huge breach of my trust and I have no clue how to deal with this.\n\nIs this relationship just unsalvageable or is there a way I can get it through Cole\'s head that none of this is okay? Could Cole have ulterior motives by letting my ex do all of these things? Any advice is welcome. I just have no clue how to handle this absurd situation. Thanks.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the insight, everyone! I really appreciate it. I don\'t have the money to do everything that was recommended, but I am going to do some investigating into Cole and my ex possibly being in cahoots with each other and confront Cole this weekend, likely to end this clusterfuck of a relationship. If there\'s any interest, I\'ll update if anything significant happens. Thank you again!\n\nEdit 2: Fixed an error\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Something is very wrong with Cole. What the fuck does he mean he feels bad for your ex who\'s stalking you? \\[...\\]\n\nDo you mind if I ask why you\'re already living with Cole?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Cost of living mostly. I live in a very expensive city so I was living month to month on my own. He basically offered to be my \"roommate\" so that we can go half and half on the rent/internet/utilities and it would relieve my financial stress (which it has A LOT). It might have been stupid to jump the gun at us moving in so quickly but he had only shown green flags until now. I can technically kick him out and try to look for a different roommate if things are totally done for since most of the stuff in our apartment is mine.\n\nCommenter: How did you meet Cole?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Through work. We both worked together in retail for a couple of years before I moved to a proper salary job and casually stayed in touch with him after I quit. We would text to just catch up and play video games together over Steam. A couple of months after I broke up with my ex he asked me out for coffee and things just progressed from there.\n\nCommenter: How do you know Cole and your ex don\'t know each other, they seem like buddies to me. How do you know Cole, how long have you been together?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** (downvoted) I\'ve been with Cole for almost 8 months at this point. I have no idea how the two of them could have met since they don\'t share any friends, went to different schools, work totally different jobs, and have completely different interests. Unless they secretly became friends while my ex has been stalking me and he\'s hidden that from me which would just be absolutely ridiculous because who would want to be friends with the guy who is stalking/trying to steal your girlfriend but at this point I have no idea anymore.\n\nCommenter: I think they have become secret allies. You need to get away from Cole. In the meantime all gifts and edibles get destroyed, cut up and coated with bleach so they can\'t be used, eaten or gifted. Put them in the big dumpster and send a photo to your ex each time. Tell him this is what you think of his garbage gifts.\n\nDoes Cole have friends and family? If so tell them all what he\'s doing, shame is a powerful motivator\n\n&gt;**OOP:** (downvoted) Cole has been the one eating all the edibles and interacting with the gifts. I do not even touch them, lol. My initial thought is maybe he wanted to keep my ex\'s gifts around so he could get free chocolates to eat. At this point, I wouldn\'t be surprised if he\'s actually THAT careless. His friends already know about all of this and seem to think it\'s funny that my ex is such a \"tryhard\". His family lives across the country but I could try texting them.\n\nCommenter: So then just deal with it if you wont put a stop to it. Just be with jerky cole and let him eat himself silly. girl you need a back bone. and stay single for a while, your picker is broken. sorry to sound harsh but I can\'t figure out why you have two jerks in a row and can\'t figure out when to break up or how to keep pests from your life.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** (downvoted) No you\'re right. My ex was easy to break up with because I had only been dating him 2 months before he pulled some absolutely dumb crap that pissed me off so much I felt no remorse in dumping him instantly. With Cole, it\'s a bit different since I\'ve known him years before dating and thought he was a really great guy until now. He\'s genuinely sweet in every other way except this one thing but this \"one thing\" is definitely bad enough to outweigh the good things. It just sucks. But I have to think about my safety first.\n\nCommenter: OP they know each other. Think about it, there is no way your ex is going to be chill handing out and decorating the apartment while your bf is literally watching him. And you bf isn’t going to be chill letting your ex do that. I’m really concerned they are in this together and you are in danger\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I\'m really starting to think this could be the case. My bf is WFH so there\'s a chance he caught my ex while he was dropping things off and they talked. He denies that but I\'m becoming more and more paranoid now and I am definitely going to see what I can do to end this relationship in case they are secretly in cahoots.  \n*To another commenter:*  \nI\'m 99% sure they WEREN\'T friends originally but I am starting to think they have come in contact at some point before this birthday incident and Cole has been keeping this from me\n\n*OOP\'s background:*\n\n&gt;I grew up with an abusive mom and an absent father so my relationship understandings are probably screwed up. Maybe I should probably go back to therapy for a while after this before putting myself out there again...\n\n*The \'green flags\' Cole showed:*\n\n&gt;I meant he only showed green flags before we started properly dating and we moved in together. Before this whole stalker mess, he was (or at least pretended to be) thoughtful, funny, helpful, and sweet. The type who if you told him you had a hard day he\'d offer a shoulder massage and let you vent to him. It wasn\'t until this stalker ex stuff that he showed such a disregard for my safety and comfort.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ntmjfw/update_my_28f_boyfriend_29m_let_my_stalker_ex_28m/)**: September 29, 2025 (3 days later)**\n\nHello all, my last post blew up a bit and many people were concerned about me so I\'m going to give you this update. I can\'t even put into words how insane this situation has gotten. Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/lgwJGmWYJ4).\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend Cole has been allowing my stalker ex to send me gifts like it\'s no big deal, and even let my ex into my apartment to decorate for my birthday.\n\nWhen I got back home on Friday, I tried to come up with a good plan to keep myself safe while I confronted Cole in case he were to do something scary (a lot of people put the fear of god into me in the comments of my last post). I invited my very tall and intimidating younger brother over to be there while I talked to Cole. My brother couldn\'t come over until Sunday, so I spent a day and a half awkwardly trying to pretend everything was fine, but I must have done a shit job because Cole kept asking me what was wrong and love bombing me.\n\nEventually Sunday came around, my brother showed up and I/we grilled Cole about why the hell he\'s been so fine with my ex coming around with gifts and even letting him in to decorate our apartment for my birthday. I was NOT ready.\n\nAll of you had a lot of theories, one of which came up a lot was that the two knew each other and/or were working together to do this. If anything I would have RATHER that been the case because the truth is so much more fucked up.\n\nBasically, Cole has been FIXATED on my ex. He has essentially been stalking my stalker. Cole admitted that he made fake social media accounts (Yes. Multiple.) to follow my ex, and has been stalking his Instagram and Facebook. Apparently, my ex has been making a lot of vent posts about me and how hurt he is that I\'m not returning his feelings and have moved on so fast and Cole has been egging him on on his alt accounts to get my ex to keep trying. The reason my ex is still stalking me is because Cole has been literally telling him to on his fucking alt accounts. It\'s obvious my ex is unstable if he\'s listening to random strangers telling to \"keep trying\" and Cole is taking advantage of his instability by planting thoughts into his head. If I am to believe Cole\'s words, my ex has no idea that it\'s Cole that\'s been encouraging him to keep pursuing me but I can\'t be certain about anything this guy says at this point.\n\nSo why, you ask, was Cole doing all of this? That is exactly what my brother and I asked. This was his answer; to give my ex false hope. Basically to bully(?) him. Any time my ex angst-posted on his social media about me, Cole got some sick satisfaction out of watching his misery. He wanted to string my ex along to keep trying to win my heart just to watch him fail over and over. Cole finds it hilarious that my ex is wasting so much money on gifts for me and that it\'s HIM who eats the chocolates and reads the desperate love letters my ex sends to me while I act like my ex\'s gifts are radioactive and avoid them. This has all been some sick game to see how long he can get my ex to keep pining for me. Who the hell even DOES THIS? I\'ve been living in fear for months because Cole thinks it\'s funny to manipulate my ex and watch him be \"heartbroken\"? I cannot articulate how sick all of this is. How is this funny? What is wrong with him? He said he \"makes sure not to go too far\" by discouraging my ex to make direct contact with me but I can\'t believe anything anymore. I\'ve read so many stories of people who were dating someone who seemed so sweet initially but turned out to be actually unhinged, but I naively never thought that could be me. I was so careless and dumb because I clung to someone who finally treated me with kindness but he is a twisted man who turned my ex into a monster by feeding his delusions. I think if he hadn\'t done all this, my ex probably wouldn\'t still be stalking me in the first place!! My constant fear and discomfort have just been an \"unfortunate byproduct\" of his little game of puppetry. I can\'t even comprehend how someone could do something like this. I\'m so shaken up I feel like I\'m spiraling.\n\nSuffice to say I\'m living with my brother and his gf while my ex gets the hell out. I told him he needs to move out within the week or I\'m getting the cops involved. He didn\'t make a fuss or anything, surprisingly. He just looked at the floor like a kicked puppy. He hasn\'t even tried to call or text me but I blocked him just in case. I\'m going to see if my landlord can understand my situation and let me break lease early with no extra cost, but if I can\'t, my brother is going to cover the extra cost in the meantime, and I\'ll stay with him and his gf until I can find somewhere else. My brother is seriously a godsend.\n\nI\'m DEFINITELY going to go back to therapy as soon as possible because this whole situation has me unable to sleep at night, trust anyone and I really need a better understanding of what are red flags in relationships. So many of you told me I was a pushover and you\'re all right. It shouldn\'t have taken this long for me to call this relationship with Cole off. This is so fucked up, but I\'m safe for now. I don\'t know what I\'d do without my brother and his gf. Thanks to everyone who told me to get out of this relationship because Cole was way more twisted than I ever could have thought. I don\'t even know if he told the whole truth, but I don\'t even care anymore. I\'m out. Gone. Never looking back.\n\n**Edit (11 hours later)**\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your advice and words of encouragement! I called the non-emergency police line to file a report of all this. It wasn\'t super helpful other than just making a record so I\'ll do a follow-up with them once I have safe access to my apartment and can collect evidence.\n\nI unblocked Cole for now to gather any text evidence as some of you suggested but he\'s been pretty quiet. He sent a photo of a couple of garbage bags full of his stuff and he asked if he could have a day to say goodbye to my cat (I have her with me currently at my brother\'s place, no way am I letting her near him). I haven\'t replied yet. I turned read receipts off.\n\nHaven\'t contacted ex 1 yet (still figuring out the best way to do that). Tomorrow is a stat holiday where I live so my brother and his gf will be home from work. We are working together to figure all this out. Definitely moving out of my current place as soon as I can.\n\nSorry I can\'t reply to all the comments, I\'m still pretty overwhelmed and anxious and there are so many that it\'s frying my brain but I\'m trying to read most of them. I appreciate every one of you, though!\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Holy shit! I\'m glad you updated us but WTF?!? That\'s absolutely insane and I\'m glad you\'re safe\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Yeah me too... I took the week off from work because I need to just figure all this shit out. I\'m so full of anxiety but my brother is trying to distract me by talking about competitive Pokémon (bless his heart).\n\nCommenter: Your brother, or someone, needs to tell your stalker. I have no sympathy for a stalker but if this went down as described, he’s basically been a victim of cyber bullying and there is no way of knowing what might happen next. He needs a dose of reality. For your safety.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I was so caught up in escaping that I never considered this. You\'re right. Thank you for reminding me, my head is such a mess right now. I\'ll need to brainstorm the best way to let my ex know. I hate to know how he\'ll react to that, though.\n\nCommenter: Maybe ask your brother to do it with an online message. It *definitely* should not come from you and this needs to head off any communication from your ex and his fake accounts. \\[...\\]\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Oh I am definitely not going to contact my stalker ex myself. I\'ll probably get my brother to do it since he at least met my ex a few times while I was dating. My dumb self didn\'t think to record Cole\'s confession so we don\'t have hard proof of his cyber harassment toward my ex. Just gotta hope he believes us and stops interacting with Cole\'s alt accounts (though I don\'t know the name of Cole\'s alts, just that he has them, which is also complicated)\n\n*OOP clarifies:*\n\n&gt;He was sending me gifts before I started dating Cole but it definitely ramped up AFTER I started dating Cole\n\n# NEW UPDATE\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeceasedCaterpillar/comments/1o05qdx/update_2_stalker_exbf1_and_unhinged_exbf2/) **2: October 6, 2025 (1 week later)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Title:** (Update 2) Stalker exBF1 and unhinged exBF2\n\nHello! Relationship\\_Advice only allows one update so I\'m continuing here. Sorry it has been a while, it\'s been a hectic week.\n\nOriginal post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/0ZoEwvCwSC).\n\nUpdate 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/p9JIQ4fHPl).\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\nCole has moved out. Locks have been changed! Still looking for a different place to move into. The housing market here is awful. I\'ve been staying with my brother despite Cole having moved out because I don\'t feel safe in that apartment. We have a nice arrangement at my brother\'s place with me buying half the groceries and cooking three times a week. Kitty is now comfortable here (she was hiding under the bed for like 3 days). Still not sleeping well but I\'m safe so that\'s what matters. I haven\'t talked to the police since before. I just couldn\'t find enough evidence in my apartment to make any kind of case since I threw out most of my stalker ex\'s gifts.\n\nHere\'s the pretty big update: Stalker ex has been informed of Cole\'s doings (I\'m just going to start calling Stalker ex \"James\" to make things easier). My brother contacted James on Facebook and told him what\'s been going on. We didn\'t have physical proof of what Cole did, nor the names of his alts, but we knew enough specific details that it seems James believed us (I\'ve been vetting everything my brother has been sending). James has informed that he checked and most of the accounts that were encouraging his stalking have been deactivated, so it further backed our story and it seems like Cole is covering his tracks (probably anticipated this).\n\nFrom the conversation, it seems that James has been wary of Cole ever since Cole let him into my apartment for my birthday. He said he didn\'t actually want to come into the apartment and just wanted to leave the gifts and decor with Cole, but Cole INSISTED he came in, and that made him feel super awkward and uncomfortable. He was worried that Cole was trying to coax him inside my apartment in order to hurt him, because the way he was acting was really off. He did his best to be in and out as fast as possible because apparently Cole just gave him bad vibes.\n\nAnyway, James seems pretty shaken. He didn\'t put 2 and 2 together that Cole was the one encouraging his behavior, but was starting to get frustrated by the \"encouragement\". Which James said bordered on harassment because one of Cole\'s alts would spam his dms with ideas and asking for updates and it was getting really intrusive (Why did it take this many months for him to finally feel this way???). He apologized and promised he would leave me alone, telling me that this situation has him really shaken up (smells like he wants pity but I\'m not falling for that). I don\'t know if I believe everything James said, I think he may have tried to play up his negative feelings about this in order to gain sympathy from my brother (and me by proxy) but who knows. I\'m not going to talk to him. That\'s hopefully it for the James side of things.\n\nOn Cole\'s side, he has been mostly quiet but something did freak me out. After I told James about what Cole did, Cole sent these texts (grammar and spelling edited from original texts):\n\n\"Why did you give James my number\"\n\n(Note: I didn\'t? Not sure how James got his number?)\n\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you\"\n\n\"Why did you tell him and give him my number\"\n\n(Note: Again, I only did the former, not latter)\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"This is fucking ridiculous\"\n\n\"He\'s blowing up my fucking phone piece of shit\"\n\n\"You\'re such a petty bitch for this\"\n\n\"Fucking freak\"\n\nThat was 3 days ago, haven\'t heard anything from Cole since. Haven\'t replied to anything he sent. No idea how James got Cole\'s number so that freaks me out but that is currently not my problem.\n\nWent back to work today. Things are okay but I\'m still anxious. Will update here on my profile if anything develops but things are stable for now. I don\'t know if there will be much new now that James is informed and Cole is out. Hopefully, things will stay stable and I can go back to my life.\n\nImportant edit:\n\nSomeone sent me a YouTube video of a Reddit Read of my posts that has two updates that never happened and sound like they were written by ChatGPT or other AI, so if you hear anything about a car being Airtagged and me going to court and then moving into a tiny apartment, that\'s all fake.

Feel like I\'m seeing an ugly side of him.**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!possible racism!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53foa6/my_32f_husband_33m_doesnt_want_our_nanny_to_teach/)  **Sept 19, 2016**\n\n\nMy husband Eric and I have been married for 5 years. We have one child, a four-year-old little lady named Katherine. We both work busy jobs but I\'m a writer and I usually work from home or from my office down the street. Our live-in nanny, Ella [45F], has been with us for about six months. She is INCREDIBLE at her job, and she\'s honestly become part of the family.\n\nThe other day Katherine, my husband and I were driving somewhere in the car and my daughter said, \"Want to hear me talk like Ella?\" And she started speaking Spanish! I\'m not fluent but I know enough to know that she was really speaking it, not just pretending. I was really impressed and told her great job, keep practicing, etc. My husband didn\'t really respond but I didn\'t think anything of it at the time.\n\nThen tonight (just now) Ella came to my office after Eric got home and took over watching Katherine. She was really quiet which isn\'t like her, and she apologized for teaching Katherine Spanish without asking. My response was basically, um...what? I told her (completely confused) that I had no problem with that and I actually think it\'s a fantastic idea. I wish somebody had taught me when I was little -- especially where we live in Southern California, it\'s a great skill to have. So I reassured her that I would actually appreciate it if she would keep teaching Katherine the language. Ella then told me that Eric had just asked her to please only speak English around Katherine.\n\nElla has gone back to our house for the night, but I\'m still sitting in my office fuming. I am beyond furious with Eric, and I know I need to collect myself before going home and speaking to him. First of all, I feel like he\'s damaged our relationship with Ella, who\'s been nothing but wonderful to us and our daughter. Secondly, I cannot for the life of me understand why it\'s a bad thing for our young daughter to learn a very useful second language (which she\'ll probably have to learn later in school anyway). Eric has never expressed any racism (if he had, we wouldn\'t be married; that\'s a dealbreaker for me), but I can\'t see any other explanation for this. And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That\'s not how a partnership should work.\n\nA) Where do I begin in addressing this with him?\n\nand B) How do I make it clear to Ella that she\'s free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?\n\n**tl;dr:** Our amazing nanny has been teaching our 4 year old daughter Spanish, and my husband asked her to stop without discussing it with me first.\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**drzoidburger**\n\n&gt;I\'m in medical school, and one of my good friends in class grew up with a nanny who taught him Spanish, and he is still fluent to this day. So many of our patients are Spanish-speaking-only, and they are blown away when this white dude with a Jew fro walks in and speaks to them in their native language. He doesn\'t have to wait for an interpreter like the rest of us. I am *so* jealous and wish I had paid more attention in Spanish class because it\'s a big advantage to have. \n\n**Diddleydoonumber2**\n\n&gt;&gt; Medical resident here: Can confirm... ability to speak Spanish is vital (especially if you\'re in an area where most of the people speak only Spanish). \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OP, at this early age, picking up languages should be pretty easy for your child. I would urge you to try and have your daughter pick up a second language... she\'s learning it for free and can make a positive impact on her life in the future.\n\n[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5484wp/update_my_32f_husband_33m_doesnt_want_our_nanny/)  **Sept 24, 2016 (5 days later)**\n\nHoly wow, thank you so much to the hundreds of people who commented with advice! I can’t believe how many helpful opinions I got.\n\nSo after my original post, I took some time to simmer down and then went home. Katherine and Ella had already gone to bed, so I sat down with Eric and asked if he could explain why he didn’t want Katherine learning Spanish. I know a lot of people said that I should approach it in a less straight-forward way so he wouldn’t find out that Ella had “snitched” on him, but I made it clear that I found out because she apologized and not because she was telling on him or anything.\n\nWe had a *very* long conversation, and it turns out that Eric feels like he’s missing Katherine’s childhood. He doesn’t enjoy his job anymore, and he feels “jealous” of me because I got the career I wanted and I still get to spend more time with our daughter than he does. I’m a screenwriter and he’s an exec at a media company, but he always wanted to be an actor. Apparently he feels like he gave up his dream for money and he wishes he worked in a creative job like I do. I had no idea how down he was feeling about everything.\n\nAfter talking it through we came to the conclusion that he already felt left out of K’s life and didn’t want to feel further excluded if she becomes fluent in a language he can’t understand. I told him that I understood this but thought it was really selfish of him, and he agreed that Katherine should continue learning Spanish.\n\nHe felt really bad about his conversation with Ella and apologized to her first thing the next day. We called Ella’s grown up daughter (really great girl in her early 20s) and found out about this fancy restaurant that Ella has always dreamed of going to. We took Ella and her daughter for a surprise dinner there and gave her a card and flowers to thank her for being a great tia to Katherine.\n\nSo the whole language issue has been resolved, and now Eric and I have to figure out what to do next about the existential crisis he seems to be having. We’re in a good financial position and I suggested the possibility of him leaving his job or taking acting classes on the side. He’s still unsure about what to do but I think he definitely feels better about having it out in the open.\n\nThank you all again for your help.\n\n**tl;dr:** Eric apologized to Ella and Katherine will keep learning Spanish.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oqljnr/my_32f_husband_33m_doesnt_want_our_nanny_to_teach/', 6702, 421, '2025-11-07 12:00:01', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

In my view, I have been seeing this guy for a couple of months casually. Sometimes we see each other 3 or 4 times a week, sometimes once every 2 weeks. We text but nothing in depth. We hang out, hook up, sometimes spend the night and rinse and repeat. I\'m paraphrasing what happened today.\n\nHe wanted to talk so I met him for breakfast today at his place. He was very apologetic and sad and said, \"this has been great getting to know you but I don\'t think this is working out anymore.\" I basically said, \"ok, do you still want to have breakfast?\" In my head, I was like he\'s ending the casual relationship. It\'s fine because we had this talk in the beginning about either of us ending it whenever.\n\nHe just kept looking at me while we were eating and finally he said, \" you know you don\'t have to hold it in. It\'s ok to be sad.\" I was confused so I said \"why would I be sad. I enjoyed my time with you. It\'s ended.\"\n\nHe then said, \"well we were in a relationship so it\'s not like ending a hookup\". This is where I fucked up. I said, \"yea but it was a casual relationship\". He said, \"what do you mean casual? We have been exclusive for over 3 months now\".\n\nUm, no we haven\'t. We had never had a talk about being exclusive, we literally only meant up to do fun activities and then hook up. When did we decide we were exclusive?\n\nMy face showed that this was brand new information to me. He said, \"we kept spending time together. It was implied (????) that we were exclusive\". No it wasn\'t and I told him that. He then asked, if I had been seeing other people to where I was just silent which basically answered it for him.\n\nHe started yelling and getting angrier because I wouldn\'t answer his questions but I literally felt like I was having an out of body experience. It was too much information to process at once.\n\nI left because he was now saying I cheated on him. He\'s now blowing up my phone and saying that we have to talk because he\'s been loyal(???) while I haven\'t. I just don\'t even know what to say.\n\nLike, what? We never had a talk about exclusivity.\n\nTL:DR- I was hooking up with a guy. He thought we were exclusive. I thought it was casual. He dumped me and then got mad that I cheated on him while we were exclusive. We never had a talk about being exclusive. I\'m now hiding from him because he wants to talk.\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**dreCoyy**\n\n&gt;Communication is apparently a superpower nowadays\n\n**~**\n\n**Robbie-R**\n\n&gt;This is the perfect scenario for a Seinfeld episode.\n\n**RagingFlower580**\n\n&gt;&gt;And George is definitely the man in this scenario.\n\n**~**\n\n**moonlitnights**\n\n&gt;I\'d just text him, tell him there\'s nothing to talk about and in his next relationship he should make it clear and not think because he thinks something is \'implied\' that it is. Then block him. Life is too short for drama.\n\n[TIFUpdate months later](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/s/4MHLz7easv)  **May 25, 2023**\n\nI would be very suprised if this post wasn\'t deleted but I made a post a few months ago about finding out I was in a committed relationship while being dumped. The post was deleted and I honestly forgot about making it.\n\nBasically in the original post I thought I had a fwb situation with a friend but he thought it was something more and when he was dumping me, I found out he thought we were exclusive for 3 months and that us being in a relationship was implied though we had never talked about being anything other than casual.\n\nJust to answer some questions-\nA. How were we able to see each other so much? We\'re college students. Our apartments are literally a street apart. We could go over to each other\'s all the time, whenever we wanted.\n\nB. What was the relationship like?\nWe would literally text each other memes or funny things or ask when the other person was free to hook up. There was no in depth convos, dates, or anything like that. Sometimes, we would hook up multiple times a week, sometimes once in 2 weeks. \n\nC. What were the fun activities?\nMovies, bowling, indoor golf, and just walking on a trail, etc. We\'re in college and not rich. \n\nD. Was what was expected dicussed?\n Yes, in detail. Before we started a sexual relationship, we discussed what we expected, the rules, what we wanted and what we would do if someone changed their mind? We both wrote the rules down in our phones and the biggest rule was to communicate if something changed for you. \n\nE. How many ppl were u hooking up with?\nOne other person, believe it or don\'t, but I had him and another person. If one was busy, another was usually available. \n\nF. Did he know you were hooking up with other ppl?\nI told him early on I was talking/hooking up with another person but I didn\'t explicity tell him who that person was. I used protection and I have been tested for both. \n\nAfter me leaving his apartment after the initial  post, we didn\'t talk for months. I did a semester abroad and he did an internship in another city. When we were both on the same campus again, I messaged him to discuss things.\n\nI asked him, did he really think we were in a committed relationship?\nHe said no. Though he was down for a fwb, once he saw me talking to a guy at a bar, he got jealous and didnt want me talking to anyone else.\n\nWhy did he act like we were in a committed relationship? \nBecause he wanted to see my reaction. If I was hurt that he was ending it, then he would have changed his mind and gave it another chance but exclusively this time. \n\nWas he hooking up with other ppl too?\nYes. So he was never exclusive with me and made up the relationship angle as a lie. \n\nI honestly panicked in that initial conversation and I apologized if I hurt him in any way but until that point, I thought we had both been transparent with each other. Turns out he didn\'t really like the idea of me hooking up with any one else but him and made up this committed relationship. We are now good and back to being platonic friends.\n\nTL;DR: Fwb dumped me and made me think he thought we were in a committed relationship. Turns out feelings on his end had changed and he didn\'t want me seeing other people. We talked it out and are now platonic friends.\n\n\nEdit: We barely see each other now. I haven\'t hooked up with him since before the \"breakup convo\" and don\'t ever plan to do it again since I know there were feelings on his end that I don\'t reciprocate. I can see what he did was manipulative but I don\'t really care to get an apology from him. I will just maintain my distance. I appreciate the concern though.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ogb3o6/tifu_by_not_realizing_i_was_in_a_committed/', 6646, 447, '2025-10-26 10:02:02', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

(124, 'reddit', '1ocs9u7', 'My 14.5 y/o baby passed and I’m a wreck', '\nI’ve been incredibly fortunate to not have experienced much loss via death in my life. So the passing of my soul cat, my best friend, my constant feels as if I’ve been hit by a train. The grief is insurmountable. She was a beacon of health for the 5 years I had her, but illness took her so so fast. We had her euthanized in our home with her head in my hands. \n\nBirdie, my companion, the one who was with me through my ups and downs, the one who loved unconditionally, the one who knew when I needed her the most - even right before her passing - is gone.\n\nBirdie was almost 10 years old with underlying FIV when I adopted her. I don’t know what the majority of her life before me looked like, but I’m confident she was destined to find me. I remember being ready for a cat - I actually had my heart set on a ragdoll or some other expensive, fancy-pants breed. In 2020, I followed a local Seattle rescue on IG, and Birdie’s picture stopped my scroll. She was a tiny, 4-pound, 10-year-old runt - and I knew she was meant for me.\n\nI knew when I adopted a senior cat that I wouldn’t get as much time as I would have liked, but nothing could have prepared me for this. The 5 years I spent with Birdie happened to be in the middle of the most formative years of my adult life. They were chaotic, ever-changing, and adventurous. And she was there every single step of the way. She moved with me many times, never complaining about a new city or state or apartment - just finding her new corner or windowsill and making it home. \n\nI don’t really know how to quantify 5 years of love, joy, chaos, loss, growth, etc into words - all I know is Birdie was truly my soul mate. I never could figure out why I didn’t believe that human soul mates existed - now I know it’s because I already had one in kitty form. She was my glue. She let me live my life, make mistakes, celebrate wins - always content with knowing I’d return home with love and treats. She was incredibly sassy, making me laugh when I didn’t want to. She saw me at my lowest and still saw all I was capable of. Home was wherever she was. I truly feel as if we shared a bond like I’ve never before experienced - one free of expectations and a quiet mutual understanding of each other’s needs. \n\nIf there’s one word that I could use to describe Birdie, it would be radiance. She was truly a light and always found it. Not a soft or fragile light - but a stubborn, impossible-to-ignore kind of sunlight that wakes you up in the morning while simultaneously reminding you that you’re still alive. I’ll forever miss her warmth on my pillow - always taking up as much space as she could, but I never did mind. I always joked that she was going to live forever, because even in her old age she was so spunky and full of life - and I truly could not picture my world without her in it. But forever came too soon, and I’m still grasping for answers. \n\nA few days before her passing - her tiny body, still agile but losing steam - jumped from the floor up to the top of the couch with me, something I hadn’t seen in a month or more. I was delightfully shocked, as she nuzzled against my head and perched in her favorite spot, just as she’d done hundreds of times before. I’ll always remember that as our last seemingly normal, precious moment - her saying “I’m still here, I’m still me, and I love you.” \n\nI know I’ll never be the same - some of my spark left with her. But I promise to live like Birdie. I promise to always eat what I want and take a big nap after. I promise to run around at odd times of day and night, never taking for granted my health and my fervor for life. I promise to always see the good in people, to take space for myself but know when others need a friend. I promise to roll with the punches, adapting to what life throws at me and turn it into a grand adventure. I promise to love those around me, stay in the moment, and even on my weakest days, use my energy for good. And I promise to always find and follow the light, even if it’s the smallest sliver of sunshine leaking through the blinds onto the floor.\n\nThe loss of my best friend feels extraordinarily heavy and impossibly permanent. I’ve lost a part of myself, and I’ll spend the rest of this lifetime and the next searching for it. \n\nI’ll love you forever, my sweet Birdie butt.

I work in software, so I make decent money, but it still takes forever to build up a good down payment. Meanwhile, my younger sister (25F) is in grad school with barely any credit. Our parents (both mid-50s) found a house near them and decided she needs it. They made an offer—without telling me—and now the deal only goes through if I co-sign.\n\nThe problem? I had no clue they’d do this. My parents basically dropped a bomb: “You have the best credit score—co-sign so your sister can get the house!” They also hinted I should chip in for the down payment because “you’ve got the money.”\n\nIf I co-sign, I’ll be on the hook if my sister can’t pay. She’s still in school, has debt, and zero backup plan. The bank might also reject my future mortgage application since they’ll see I’m already tied to another loan. But my parents say I’m “selfish” and “forgetting family values.” My sister’s calling me a monster for leaving her “stranded,” and my mom threatened to cut off any future financial help (like wedding money) if I don’t help right now.\n\nSome relatives think it’s insane my parents tried to rope me into this after they already made the offer. Others say I should just do it for “the family’s sake.” I feel guilty, but also mad they put me in this spot. AITA for protecting my own finances, or are they wrong for strong-arming me into co-signing a mortgage I never wanted in the first place?\n\n**EDIT:** I’m actually adopted lmao forgot to mention in my confused and angry state. My parents adopted me when I was very young because they’d been struggling to conceive. A few years later, they had my younger sister naturally, which was a huge deal to them—she was their “miracle baby.” Ever since, it’s felt like my role in the family became “the older, adopted one,” while she was the golden child who could do no wrong. Growing up, I was expected to pitch in more, be more responsible, and generally look out for my sister.\n\nI worked my butt off in school, snagged scholarships, and eventually landed a good job in software. All the while, I felt like my family mostly saw me as the “fallback option” in case anyone needed financial or emotional support. Now that I’m actually building my own life—saving for a house, focusing on my career—I’m realizing how my success just makes me look like a bigger piggy bank to my parents. The more independent I become, the clearer it is that I need to separate myself from the constant guilt trips and the unspoken expectation that I’ll always bail them (or my sister) out. I love them, but I can’t keep sacrificing my own future to maintain a dynamic where I’m never the priority.\n\nSo thank you all for the wake up call. Update to come\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Why didn’t OOP’s parents co-sign the loan?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** They have financial strains and don’t want to incure thar risk. And don’t have the best credit either\n\n**Why didn’t OOP\'s parents help her with buying a house?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We were at odds due to another family issue\n\n**Commenter 1:** So, your sister is the Golden child and you are not. Don\'t cosign the loan. Tell your parents to give your sister the wedding money and since your finances won\'t be a dumpster fire (as they would if you cosign the loan) you\'ll pay for your own wedding-- and will be sure to send them a picture since obviously they won\'t be there. Tell them how much you appreciate them freeing you from having to care for them as they age since that will fall 100% to your sister.\n\nNTA but your family is really toxic.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Probably something I should have said this but was blinded by my confusion and forgot to mention. I was adopted, not at as a baby but around the age of 6. Was always different and never bothered to reconnect with bio mom. I knew I was an outsider but as I got older and somewhat over shadowed my younger sister with my “successful “career I think it created a resentment between my parents and me. So it think it’s hitting it breaking point and really showing…\n\n**Commenter 2:** Absolutely do NOT co-sign. NTA if you refuse.  Let your Mom not pay for the wedding. If she’s threatening now, she will again.   In the end she probably won’t. But that’s not hhe main reason not to co-sign. The main reason is there is a huge chance you will be in debt for a house that is not yours. \n\n**Commenter 3:** Terrible idea.. why does she need a house rn if she has barely any credit and she’s mid grad school.. an apartment sounds like what she needs\n\n**Commenter 4:** Lock down your credit score and make sure they can\'t use your information anyway. My sister had hers trashed by the EX because he would take out loans in her name. I have seen parents do this as well, regardless of the child\'s age. Or consent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Uf7KARXCjI): **December 27, 2024 (next day)**\n\nOkay, so here’s where I’m at: I’m absolutely not signing my sister’s mortgage (and I’m definitely not pitching in for any down payment). This whole thing was the final push I needed to realize how messed up our family dynamic has been for ages. I mean, I’ve always known it was bad, but having them basically try to volunteer me—and my finances—without even asking just crossed a line I can’t ignore anymore.\n\nI’m done. I’ve decided to cut ties. I’m already in the process of dropping any financial entanglements we might have—cutting off shared accounts, making sure they can’t use my information for anything, and basically scrubbing them from my finances. My job lets me work remotely, so I’m planning to move out of state soon. That was always in the back of my mind, but now it feels urgent. I need space, distance, and a real shot at a normal life without the constant guilt trips.\n\nI’m also locking down my credit—freezing it, changing passwords, everything. I’m not taking any chances that someone might try to open a line of credit in my name. I’ve seen enough horror stories and I’m not about to become one.\n\nThankfully, I’m not alone in all this. My close friends have been incredible. They’re basically my real family at this point—helping me pack, offering me a place to stay if I need it, reminding me that I’m not crazy for wanting to protect my future. They’ve been the biggest source of support, and I’m honestly so grateful to have them in my corner.\n\nSo yeah, that’s it. I’m not signing. I’m leaving. I’m done. If my family wants to blow up at me for “abandoning them,” so be it. I’ve gotta look out for myself, my credit, and my sanity. Here’s to hoping things only get better from here.\n\nEveryone who commented their 2 cents are amazing people and I thank you all for your support while I’m dealing with this. Truly thank you. ❤️\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Be sure to freeze your credit with all 3 bureaus and freeze your Social Security number as well.\n\n**OOP clarifies the timeline on when she was adopted into the family**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Honestly, it’s not as dramatic as it sounds. We’re three years apart in age—I’m older—but my adoption was finalized around the time my sister was toddler-aged. The process itself had started earlier, and it wasn’t all done in a day. My parents had me placed with them before it was legally official, so by the time the paperwork went through when I was six, she was already three. It’s just a messy timeline that happens when adoption, fertility struggles etc. I forget all the details sometimes my apologies\n\n**Commenter 2:** I would also contact the financial institution that is issuing the mortgage and tell them you’re not involved in case they forge your signature. They have your social security number and may have already had the bank run your information.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/opMqBiec6e): **December 28, 2024 (next day)**\n\nDiscovered a Credit Card in My Name\n\nOk. I was really hoping the [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Na8NmsPlCK) post would be the last one but here I am . I didn’t expect it to turn into a bigger mess. After deciding not to co-sign the mortgage for my sister, I started taking extra precautions with my finances locking down my credit, pulling my full credit reports, like you all suggested. I wanted to be absolutely sure no one could use my information without me knowing.\n\nThat’s when I stumbled on an active credit card I didn’t open. Some of you guys warned me and I guess I wasn’t fast enough to lock down. It’s been around for a couple of years now.. It was being using but I’m assuming my parents wanted to keep it from me with the intention of using it as leverage. As of YESTERDAY, the statements show purchases that look a lot like household expenses. The billing address on file points right back to my parents’ home.\n\nI confronted them, via text, because I’m currently a couple hours away with a close friend. They claimed I “benefited” from these expenses, which doesn’t make much sense like how did because they never helped me with setting up my own apartment. Also, it explains why they assumed I’d be okay with co-signing: turns out they’ve been using my credit for a while.\n\nNeedless to say, I feel completely betrayed. This wasn’t some tiny oversight my parents have been quietly using my name to fund their expenses. Now I’m talking to a professional to figure out whether I should dispute the charges or close the account outright (without tanking my own credit in the process). It’s nerve-wracking realizing how they went behind my back even before this mortgage BS.\n\nAt this point, I’m even more determined to move out of state to get distance from all this. My job is thankfully remote-friendly, so relocating won’t wreck my career. My friends have been amazing, offering support so I don’t completely lose my mind. If it weren’t for them, I’d be a mess right now.\n\nI’m not trying to be vindictive or over-dramatic I just need to protect myself. The trust is gone, and I don’t see how I can maintain a healthy relationship with people who thought this was okay. It’s sad, and I wish it didn’t come to this, but I’ve got to prioritize my own future.\n\nI’ll let you know if anything else major happens, but for now I’m focused on fully separating my finances from my family, getting ready to move, and making sure I don’t pay the price (credit-wise) for something I never agreed to. It’s scary, but I’m hoping it’ll be worth it to finally have a life and a credit score of my own.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Well.\n\nIf They opened credit in your name, that is considered identity theft.\n\nYou should file a police report. Let the chips fall where they may.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Hang in there.

So here it is.\n\nLast year I cut my parents off and thought that was the end. They tried to force me to co-sign a mortgage for my younger sister, called me selfish when I refused, and I found a credit card opened in my name at their address. I froze my credit, shut everything down, moved out of state, and told myself, “Done. No more access.”\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis week a letter from the county recorder shows up about a newly recorded deed of trust “with my updated address.” I pull the record: my full legal name as co-borrower, a signature that’s supposed to be mine, and a hometown notary stamp.\n\n“But she’ll lose her house.” If your roof depends on a forged co-borrower, you never had a house. You had a countdown.\n\nI did not apply for this loan. I did not sign this loan. I was not even in the same state the day they claim I sat with a notary.\n\nI called the lender’s fraud department and asked for the e-sign audit trail. The IP used for “my” signature? My parents’ Wi-Fi.\n\nI emailed the notary. She replied IN WRITING that she “saw me over FaceTime” and matched my ID from a photo my mom provided. That is not legal. That’s “I didn’t do my job and now I’m part of a crime.”\n\nHere’s what I have: the deed listing me as co-borrower, the fake signature and stamp, the lender’s e-sign audit with their IP, records placing me out of state, and last year’s police report from the secret credit card.\n\nSo I acted.\n\nFiled a police report for identity theft and forgery with exhibits.\n\nFiled a state notary complaint with her written admission.\n\nFiled an FTC identity theft affidavit.\n\nSent a fraud packet to the lender demanding removal of my name and treating the acknowledgment as defective.\n\nExtended my 7-year fraud alert, re-froze all bureaus, locked my USPS address, opened a PO box.\n\nRetained a lawyer.\n\nSent my parents a written cease-and-desist: stay out of my finances. All contact is email only.\n\nI’m not giving them time to “fix it quietly.” I’m not offering a refinance window. I’m not protecting them so my sister doesn’t “have to move.” If this loan collapses, it’s because they built it on my stolen identity. That’s on them.\n\n“But she’ll lose her house.” If your roof depends on a forged co-borrower, you never had a house. You had a countdown.\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous and I feel like I’m out of my mind. I thought this was all behind me I guess not. I’ve has some amazing help over the last year trying to piece my life back together but things are so shitty right now.\n\nI don’t care if she ends up homeless fuck them im so done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oou5mj/new_update_aita_for_refusing_to_cosign_my_sisters/', 6511, 604, '2025-11-05 12:04:05', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

I don\'t care who you are or where you come from, what god you subscribe to or what side of the aisle you align with, this man and his cohort of supplicant dogs are destroying this country.\n\nJust 2 weeks ago I nearly got detained by ICE for trying to stop these animals from arresting a family off Broadacres Marketplace in Vegas. Literally smashed 3 of their windows, dragged two parents out of their car, knees on backs while their two young kids were crying in the car glass all over these kids too. These guys nearly jumped me as I was trying to get their names and information, one straight up said to me \"you come close and you\'re next\" I couldn\'t tell they were Latino, European or any other immigrant background in all honesty at all they just looked like average white people maybe half a shade more tanned it\'s Vegas we regularly have 100 degree summers tanning people naturally and I\'m pretty sure these guys didn\'t care the man they detained kept saying he was a citizen they just didn\'t care. Luckily my twin brother called Vegas PD before dragging me a safe distance away because in that moment I wanted to lay these guys out which woulda landed me in Nigeria for all we know and for once I was glad the police showed up de-escalated the situation. That family got to walk free because we called the POLICE but no doubt they are traumatised by this shit who wouldn\'t be in that situation? Is there any news coverage any 6 o\'clock news story on this no, If I was them I would leave the country after something like that no way you would feel safe sending your kids to schools where they can get shot at and pick them up only to be fucking detained by ICE. There are probably hundreds of thousands stories like this happening right now and that worries me. How long can this go on for, how long is it gonna be until they just take Americans off the street because they don\'t care if you are a migrant or not. I didn\'t need to have the IRL experience to tell you that this current environment is simply unsustainable because there are no guard rails, no due process, no accountability. Why do ICE wear these masks? they know what they are doing is fucking illegal and don\'t want to be recognised for their actions because that would mean actual consequences. How long is it gonna be until you aren\'t \"American\" enough and get detained for it?\n\nAnd the kicker is Obama deported tons of people, way more than Trump in his first term I and many others won\'t debate that fact but he didn\'t send paid masked up goons with the authority of the President and more job security than a civil servant into minority neighborhoods to literally de-humanise and assault people in front of their kids as they send them to god knows where and call that shit righteous or justice. We still don\'t know where the hundreds of missing people who got sent to \"Alligator Alcatraz\" went and nobody gives a shit.\n\nI\'ve seen the impact of this government\'s god awful actions here at home, Vegas is dead, in 10 months tourism is gone these once bustling strips are empty, nobody wants to come here to the US let alone Vegas, nobody can afford to go out here or even wants to risk being caught up in this shitstorm here anymore. I work in finance I will tell you for free we are gonna be in a recession by the years end, no amount of tariff revenue can cover the gigantic holes in our economy being held up by the few US tech companies run by tech oligarchs right now profiting off the AI bubble before it bursts. Right now Nvidia has $4.6 trillion market cap, our entire pharmaceutical industry has a combined market cap of $4.2 trillion. If Nvidia has a bad day on the markets it now literally impacts the entire US economy.\n\nWhen it comes to trade relations just give up Trump has alienated and threatened our own allies with his dumbass policy, yes start a trade war with China lets see how that will go for us when we haven\'t had a robust manufacturing industry for the last 50 years because we outsource everything. It will just get to a point where the rest of the world will just turn their back on America because who would genuinely want work with us after all that has happened now? Just look at the Hyundai plant raid in Georgia that happened in September, 1 dumb woman named Tori Branum who mind you was running for Georgia\'s 12th congressional district gave a tip to ICE about foreigners who were Korean nationals trying to train workers and get the Hyundai, 475 South Korean workers all here legally got detained by ICE. Now these guys got released eventually but all these workers all but 1 decided to leave and never return so we have a Hyundai Plant in Georgia that cost upwards of $7 billion to even build is now empty with no one to train AMERICAN workers for the job let alone actually work. South Korea is one of the largest foreign investors in the US and we have now given them no reason to trust us, same with China, India and others. We are risking cooperation and actual growth over the same culture wars that the Right criticizes constantly.\n\nBut we have bigger shit to worry about we might heading into a fucking war with what seems to me South America and any other country our Commander in Queef and Weekend Warrior Pete decide to extrajudicially kill the citizens of with no evidence. So much for being the \"no wars\" President.\n\nEpstein, Venezuela, the US and Trump being in an abusive relationship with Isreal basically funding a genocide with our tax dollars, Tariffs, ICE raids, thoughts and prayers for mass shootings that happen every week, tearing down the East Wing for a $200m Gilded age ballroom that will be used 5 times a year while people starve, lose their healthcare and lose their jobs, crypto coins, merch, selling off US land to foreign countries like Qatar so they can build a military base in Idaho, sending in the military against the civilian population, literal AI shitposts by the leader of the free world, shutting down the government because you simply just don\'t want people your people to have affordable healthcare. I can\'t even keep track of all of this dangerous low IQ BS  but all I know is that this house of cards will fall but it will be Americans who pay the price.\n\nAnd to the people who voted for a overgrown, obese nepo baby who inherited his wealth and didn\'t earn anything in his life did you really think that the billionaire convicted felon rapist older than color TV\'s was gonna look out for you or this country?

When I was younger (19), I cheated in one of my relationships. The circumstances don\'t matter, it could have been handled differently, I cheated and that\'s that. Fast forward when I was 23, I met Alice. Alice was an absolute blast, I never really connected to another person like I did with her, we got serious from the 2nd time we saw each other and started dating exclusively straight away. Even though it\'d been a while since my one and only time of cheating, I still felt like that was something you should disclose to anyone you\'re getting serious with. I told her about it, she talked, wanted to know more in-depth about the situation, but ultimately it didn\'t matter for her because in her words I was a \"completely different person now\".\n\nHere\'s where the trouble starts: her friends. They were all nice with me in the beginning, but as relationship kept going on, nearing the 1 year mark, they grew kind of stand offish with me, I didn\'t really feel welcome or like I was part of the group if Alice and me went out with them somewhere. Then all of a sudden that changed, they were all welcoming to me, really friendly, hanging out and physically affectionate. I\'m not that way myself, but I like it when others are that way with me, it shows they care, I guess.\n\nOne day, Alice\'s best friend, Samantha, asks me to hang out for a bit. Samantha was someone who was always friendly with me, even during the short period when the others weren\'t. At one point, I even helped her get through her ex cheating on her, due to her knowing my past and wanting some different perspective on the matter. Anyway, I\'m out with Samantha in the local park, just talking and waiting patiently to tell me what\'s wrong. Instead, she plants a kiss on me, and it\'s pretty intense, she grabbed me by the face and just tried to shove her tongue in my mouth. I pushed her off almost instantly. She starts saying she\'s sorry, that she didn\'t mean this to happen, etc. and so on, and quickly excuses herself and leaves. Meanwhile I\'m completely at a loss what happened and I don\'t call Alice straight away, I\'m still kind of in shock. When I do end up calling Alice, I find out Samantha already called her and told her what happened, except not really. According to Samantha, I\'m the one who kissed her first and started making out before she put a stop to things.\n\nCue a lot of drama, a lot of name-calling, a lot of begging on my part to be believed. But it didn\'t work. Alice and me were history. None of the people from her group of friends are even answering my calls or messages. I just wanted to know why this all happened. I don\'t get that. I don\'t get answers or closures. My girlfriend didn\'t believe me. She didn\'t even break up with me in person, it was over a phone call. So I sunk into a depression, no surprise. Couple of friend stuck by me, helped me get through, but for more than two years now, I have avoided any chance to meet new people or if someone expressed an interest in me, I would just ignore it.\n\nI got an email yesterday from Alice, it\'s still here sitting on my screen. It starts off with a million apologies, because she found out the truth about what really happened on recently. The whole thing with Samantha was premeditated. The whole fucking friend group was in on it. They didn\'t like that Alice and I were getting serious, that we were talking about moving in together after being together for less than a year. Samantha decided to be the one to kiss me, because apparently I seemingly clicked the best with her out of all of them and the cheating thing would be most believable that way. The others backed up her stories about how close we were at the group meetups. Yeah, I know, it\'s so fucked up. Alice has only found out about this a week ago from one of the people who had a falling out with the rest of the group and on their way out they wanted to blow up the whole thing with every dirty little secret they had.\n\nShe tells me she hasn\'t dated anyone since we broke up, she didn\'t have the will to try again after our relationship, she just studied and worked and hung out with her friends. After she found out the truth, she says she cried for days, because she really did love me, even after the breakup, because a part of her couldn\'t believe it happened (the cheating). She\'s begging me get together with her, even if only for just some closure, just for one date where she can apologize in person. I haven\'t responded yet, because I don\'t know what to say. For a year or more after the break-up, I fucking dreamed of this happening, her finding out the truth, us coming back together better than ever. But now there\'s nothing. My heart didn\'t skip a beat, I don\'t feel anxiety or anticipation of any sort that might happened due to meeting her. To put it short, I don\'t know what to do.\n\nDo I agree to her request about meeting up? And if so, do I end up giving us two a go again? I\'m not sure if I could. I\'m not sure if I feel anything anymore for her. My best friend says that might be me just preemptively protecting myself from more hurt, but I don\'t know.\n\n**tl;dr** Girlfriend was tricked into thinking I cheated on her by her best friend, and the rest of the friend group was in on it. This was believable due to one instance of cheating when I was younger. Got broken up over the phone, out of contact for more than two years now, but now the ex-girlfriend found out the truth of things and wants to meet up and talk about things with me. Do I meet up with her or do I just say \'thank you\' for the apology and move on with my life? Do I even try to get together with her if I do end up meeting with her?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**DiscardUserAccount**\n\n&gt; OP, I think you ought to meet at least once. Give her a chance to apologize in person. See if the spark is still there. If you don\'t, you will always wonder.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, be wary. She says she\'s sorry. She says she\'s cut her friends off and has nothing to do with them. Well, talk is cheap. Remember, she was friends with them for years. She may be just as toxic as they are.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;She may be just as toxic as they are. How do I recognize if this is true or not?\n\n**NtWEdelweiss**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;For starters I would check whether or not she still talks with said friendgroup. Only if she no longer speaks to them would I consider going back to her. But those are my thoughts.\n\n**~**\n\n**TheMocking-Bird**\n\n&gt; I\'m conflicted on this. On one hand she choose to believe her collective group of friends before ever hearing your side of things. But then again if you were in a similar position and the majority of the people you trusted told you a harsh truth about your SO would you not believe them for having your back?\n&gt; \n&gt; It\'s been two years after the fact. You closed yourself off due to this, she claims to have done the same thing. Maybe that\'s true, I honestly don\'t know. If you feel nothing, you may consider meeting her. You don\'t really have anything to lose. I might suggest something different if you weren\'t so detached from dating, but seeing her might give you a sense of closure in order to either move on, or give what could have been another shot. I also suggest seeing if her claims of not seeing anyone in between are true, you were broken up so she was technically free to do her thing, but considering the circumstances of your break up, you may feel different if you choose to give it another shot and find out she lied about seeing other people.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; \"But then again if you were in a similar position and the majority of the people you trusted told you a harsh truth about your SO would you not believe them for having your back?\"\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to say that all of them are her childhood friends, people she\'s known for more than 20 years. It\'s not that I found her believing them over me to be implausible, I guess I just wished she\'d have trusted my version of the story.\n\n**shybonobo**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;She is just as much of a victim as you are in this scenario. The question is whether any feelings remain after all the drama.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/GVyFrMZgf3)  **May 11, 2019 (3 months later)**\n\nI decided to give my ex-girlfriend that one meet up, for her sake. I honestly wasn\'t expecting to gain anything myself from this. But I still remembered how much I cared for her, so I figured I could do this one thing and we could both move on with our lives. Meeting her in person though, that was a whole different thing. I don\'t know how to describe this feeling, but it was quite like anticipation, like when you\'re just expecting something to happen, and don\'t know if it\'s good or bad. Now that I look back on it, I know I was hoping for good. \n\nWe talked a great deal when we met and ended up staying out for hours. A great deal of it was her sincerely apologizing for not believing me and breaking up with me over the phone without even giving me a chance, but in truth, I couldn\'t blame her and told her as much, since these were all people she grew up with. She didn\'t really have a reason to not believe them, since they never did this sort of thing before. This was followed by some shit talking of her former friends, that was kind of nice and we ended up having a few laughs over it, even though I could tell she was sad by what happened. She\'s only got two friends now, an older woman from her workplace and a girl her age from a hobby workshop. They seem to be good for her, from what she\'s saying, but she admits that  occasionally she misses what she had with her previous friends, if not the people themselves. \n\nI really did end up feeling better from that one talk and when the time came to go our separate ways, she asked me if I would be open to talking with her more in the future. Alice was upfront about her hoping that there might still be something between us in the future, but she wasn\'t pushy about it. Anyway, told her I wouldn\'t know, but also told her to just talk when she feels like it and I might or might not reply. Exchanged numbers and that was it for the day. \n\nWithout dragging this out any further, we started dating again. Talking ended up bringing back how I used to feel about her, but I was holding back for a lot of the time and she was very patient with me. Never tried to push too much, never tried to just pick up from where we ended. It\'s basically dating like we\'ve never dated with each other, in some way. Not sure if I can describe it properly, English isn\'t my first language. I guess it\'s got that good part of where you\'re getting to know someone and actually enjoying doing so. A lot of talk about trust has been had. \n\nJust a few days back was when after a night out she invited me to her place. I knew what this was about obviously, but I wasn\'t 100% sure. I guess I was just being cautious on some level. Alice seemed to sense it and let me off with some words of how I might need some rest for work in the morning, so she\'d understand. I can\'t really tell you how that made me feel exactly, but it - it just shows me she cared. She cares and I went up with her and it was something I really fucking missed. It\'s not just two people together. It\'s her and me together. So yeah, we\'re together, we\'re dating and we\'re taking it a bit slowly, but I\'m happy and she\'s happy and things aregood. \n\n**tl;dr** We met, talked a lot, then talked some more after that. Started dating again and I\'m happy.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o65h73/ex_29f_who_dumped_me_26m_because_she_thought_i/', 5901, 282, '2025-10-14 10:00:03', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

We were high school friends, grew apart, ended up going to the same college, similar majors, reconnected, you can guess the rest.\n\nWe\'ve been on the rocks lately. Our lifestyles just don\'t align very well, and sometimes he treats me more like a mother than a partner. I am losing patience.\n\nHe is an only child, and kind of a massive momma\'s boy. His mom is nice enough, just very traditional. Until recently, I don\'t feel like I\'ve had a reason to distrust her. He confides in her a lot about our relationship, sometimes an uncomfortable amount. For the past couple of months, I feel like she\'s been trying to plant seeds in my head about having kids when I\'m alone with her.\n\nSome examples:\n\n\"The joy of motherhood is like nothing else. You\'ll understand someday.\"\n\n\"I know it\'s hard right now. You know, a baby might bring you closer.\"\n\n\"My husband and I fought constantly until we finally had [bf\'s name].\"\n\n\"Once you have a baby, everything else falls away. They\'re little miracle workers.\"\n\n\"You know, fatherhood changes people. I think [bf\'s name] just needs to experience it.\" (that last one in regards to his irresponsibility and lack of accountability for housework)\n\nI\'m on the pill. I\'ve been trying to get on a different form of birth control that doesn\'t require constant effort (like an IUD, injections, arm implant) but I haven\'t been able to decide which one is right for me. My birth control comes in a blister pack, but I usually pop a week\'s worth into a pill organizer so I can just take it with my other medications. I don\'t bother taking the sugar pills you\'re supposed to take during the week of your period.\n\nI keep the empty blister packs with the leftover sugar pills in my nightstand because I\'m weird about throwing things away sometimes (\"what if I need it later\" mentality I picked up from growing up in a doomsday prepping household. thanks dad). I feel incredibly stupid for that now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I missed my period. Took a pregnancy test, saw the dreaded second line, and proceeded to freak out. BF was at work when I found out, so I called him immediately. I told him we needed to talk, and that it was urgent. He didn\'t want to come home at first since we are not in a great situation financially. I started bawling and begging, and I think he realized I was serious.\n\nWhen he got home, I was sitting on the bathroom floor. I was a wreck, cried so hard I vomited. Anyways, BF gets back to our apartment, finds me on the floor, and as soon as he sees the pregnancy test, he fucking smiles. His face lit up, and I saw red. No acknowledgement of the state I was in. The first thing he said to me besides, \"what\'s going on??\" was, \"oh my god, baby, this is great!\" I wanted to put my head through the wall.\n\nI tried to explain to him through snot and tears and spit that no, this was not great, we\'re both full time students with jobs. I can\'t take time off. I have a ton of unresolved health issues. We can barely afford the roof over our heads. I hate the idea of getting an abortion. I am all for it when it\'s someone else, just for me, I don\'t know if I can bring myself to do it.\n\nHe left me to cool down in the bathroom for a while (I told him to get out) and I saw one of my fucking blister packs in the bathroom trash can. We don\'t use it very often, so we only empty it once in a while. I threw away the pregnancy test, it knocked aside a wad of toilet paper, and the silver foil caught my eye. I dug through the trash and I found 7 of my regular fucking birth control pills at the bottom of the trash bag. I can\'t believe he not only did this to me but also was so incredibly careless. It\'s like he barely tried to hide it. I can\'t tell if he wanted me to find out or if he just genuinely doesn\'t have anything knocking around inside his cranium besides a few rocks.\n\nI had been wracking my brain trying to figure out how this could\'ve happened. I am so, so diligent about taking my meds. I feel so fucking stupid. So so so stupid. The sugar pills are literally a different fucking color. I take like 7 pills in the morning and unceremoniously dump them into my mouth, I definitely didn\'t look closely at them. He didn\'t give me a reason to think I had to. He hadn\'t said anything about kids. I could tell he was kind of trying to be better about his responsibilities lately, I thought things were finally starting to look up when it came to the state of our relationship.\n\nWe have access to each other\'s phones. I think he probably checked my fitbit app to find out when I was ovulating, since I track my period there. I don\'t know how else he could\'ve known. I think I remember a few times I\'d unlock my phone and find the app open, but I thought nothing of it.\n\nI confided in a few close friends about all of this. Told them everything. What he did, how I think he did it, how I think his mom might\'ve told him to, how fucking devastated I am and how stupid I feel. In essence, they told me I need to grow a spine, leave him, stop going crazy, and figure my shit out/decide what to do. Now a part of me feel like i migjt be overreacting. Im staying with my parents right now, they don\'t know what\'s going on. They\'re kind of religious, and I\'m not exactly sure how they feel about abortion. I don\'t want to bring it up because I don\'t know how they\'ll react. BF has been texting me nonstop, telling me to calm down and come home and talk to him. I\'m so fucking lost. Sorry if this is a mess. I\'m not proofreading, I don\'t have the bandwidth right now.\n\n**Quick edit:** I\'m terminating. I\'m chronically ill, I\'d have an extremely risky pregnancy, and I don\'t want to bring a kid into this environment. I\'ve made an appointment, but I\'m still so scared. I also had my friend gently prod my ex over text about what happened, and he didn\'t even have to do much. He bent immediately, saying he needed to get it off his chest and that he \"feels like a terrible person\" (he is). I am leaving that goddamn scumbag scourge on my life far behind me, he just doesn\'t know it yet.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Girl there is absolutely no shame in getting an abortion. I would definitely not want to even co-parent with someone like that if they are so incredibly manipulative. \n\n&gt; **OOP:** It\'s not so much shame as it is guilt and anxiety. I just worry that if I do I\'ll regret it for the rest of my life, or that something will go wrong. I guess there\'s no way to know unless I do it. Maybe you\'re right.\n\n**Commenter 2:** I am not going to sugarcoat this: This is a form of sexual assault. He is trying to force you to carry a child to term, birth it and raise it, all without your consent. This is not a safe person to have in your life, nor is he safe to raise a child. Him and his mom — your description of his mom makes me think they did this together or it was her idea.\n\nA word of advice: if you do decide to terminate, tell him you miscarried. He doesn’t deserve the truth, and you don’t deserve whatever terrible response he and his mom would direct your way.\n\nYou need to put yourself first and decide what you want your life to be. Good luck, OP.\n\n&gt; **Commenter 3:** 100%. OP, this man has committed a pretty serious crime against you. You are not overreacting. I understand the guilt aspect of not wanting to have an abortion and that’s a super valid way to feel, however it’s worth considering that if he was willing to commit an act of sexual violence to keep you with him and doing what he wants, you really don’t know what he’s capable of. And you really don’t know what his mother is capable of. It’s common knowledge that you should not bring a child into a relationship that is struggling. It’s a hard thing to do even in a strong relationship. And you don’t want to condemn a child to a life with these people either.\n&gt; \n&gt; You don’t want to be tied to this man and his mother for the rest of your life. There are literally millions of men out there who could give you a child when you were ready, willing and most importantly, AWARE of what was happening. I promise you deserve so much better than this!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 4:** If you’re in a single party consent state/country, record him admitting it and report him to the police. What a fucking monster.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** I\'m in IL, it\'s an all party consent state. I have a really close mutual friend with him that I\'ve known since childhood. I\'m gonna ask if he\'d be willing to gently prod BF via text to try to get an admission/explanation. Both because I plan on filing a police report once I figure out how, and because I feel like I need to know exactly what happened. I don\'t know if I\'ll get that closure. We\'ll see.\n\n**Commenter 5:** Also not sure if OP is in the US, but definitely wait on reporting until you confirm your state\'s current laws on abortion. You probably won\'t want to report if you\'re in a state that has made abortion illegal, as it would document your pregnancy. Am so sorry, OP\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I\'m in IL, thankfully abortion is protected here. I\'m going to terminate. I feel like at this point I have a moral obligation to report him. He did it to me, he could do it to somebody else. He deserves to face repercussions for this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[My boyfriend tampered with my birth control without my knowledge or consent, and now I\'m pregnant. Can I go to the police?](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/n4KiDWxcM6): **September 9, 2025 (same day, five hours later)**\n\nLocation: IL\n\nMy boyfriend swapped my normal birth control with sugar pills. I have some physical evidence of the tampering (the pills he threw away), and screenshots of him admitting that he did it/an explanation of how he did it via texts he sent to my friends. Does this warrant going to police? I don\'t even know where to start or what I would say.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NAL This is called reproductive coercion. There are specific laws against this in some jurisdiction, but still might be actionable in other jurisdictions. You at least have grounds for a civil suit\n\n**Commenter 2:** NAL. Yes, you can always go to the police. There\'s no harm in talking to the police to see if they\'ll file charges.\n\nSome argue that it\'s a form of sexual assault because it violates consent. You would not have had sex with him had you known the truth. But I don\'t believe that IL has a specific law concerning this.\n\nIt also goes by the name \"reproductive coercion\".\n\nHere\'s an Illinois organization that fights abuse and violence in relationships. Perhaps they can help advise you. Here\'s their page on reproductive abuse : https://betweenfriendschicago.org/2025/04/18/reproductive-abuse-is-sexual-violence-lets-call-it-what-it-is/\n\n**Commenter 3:** Hi there, I am a legal advocate for SA victims and have worked for multiple crisis centers in different states including Illinois. You have a few options here, but I would start with finding the rape crisis center for your area through the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Rape crisis advocates in IL have absolute privilege and can’t report or share anything without your permission, so you can feel safe that law enforcement won’t be notified unless you want them to be. They’ll go over all of the options with you and be able to give you information specific to your area and even meet with you in person to help you make a report, attend hearings with you, etc.\n\nhttps://icasa.org/crisis-centers\n\n(Edit to add: legal advocacy through rape crisis centers is FREE. They aren’t attorneys but they are extremely helpful)\n\n**Commenter 4:** As a a victim of reproductive coercion I think you should consult with a qualified Illinois attorney. An attorney can help clarify potential civil claims and determine the best legal course of action.\n\nAbortions are still legal in Illinois.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/HVmmz4SEWk): **October 2, 2025 (nearly one month later)**\n\nUpdate: My (22f) birth control was tampered with by my boyfriend (22m). I\'m pregnant. I don\'t know what to do?\n\nI haven\'t proofread this (sorry) so please excuse any screwups\n\nSo much has happened since I last posted here, as I\'m sure you can imagine. Long story short, ex\'s family is a MESS. Getting in touch with legal professionals and talking to police has been so overwhelming, but I am lucky enough to be working with some absolute angels. I can\'t get into the weeds of all that in this post. It doesn\'t really look great, but it\'s hard to say what\'ll happen since everything is so fresh. Courts move at a snail\'s pace, but if I\'m ever in a position to give an update I will.\n\nNow for everything else I guess.\n\nEx confessed to messing with my birth control. I have a close childhood friend who my ex took to early in our relationship. Looking back, ex definitely had a little bit of a thing for her. I think everyone who knows her kinda does (myself included). She is compassionate, amaidable, gorgeous, the whole package. Anyone who knows her well knows she is not to be fucked with. Point is, he trusted her a lot. A few hours after I made my post, she and I got together and schemed. We very gently prodded him over text. He barely bent before he broke. We deliberately made the text messages sound super nonjudgmental, like she was on his side. She threw me under the bus a little bit and implied she felt closer to him than to me to really sell the act. I can\'t go into detail about how the conversation went down (legal shit), but I do have the screenshots and I will definitely be posting them if I can once all of this is over and done with (if I remember to, that is).\n\nI don\'t think ex would\'ve ever spilled his guts if she hadn\'t been in the picture. Friend has been by my side pretty much ever since. I mentioned at the end of my original post that I\'ve been staying with my parents, and they have been gracious enough to help me until I\'m back on my feet no matter how long it takes.\n\nI quit my dead end job (I\'ve been meaning to anyway), and I\'ve been doing school online. Friend brought her mini work-from-home set up and we\'ve both just been sharing a bed in my childhood room most nights. Also we sorta kissed. Only once. It was nice. I had a big fat crush on her for like the entirety of high school. Idk what else to say about that. I won\'t bore you guys with the details since I know it\'s not what you\'re here for lol. I don\'t wanna tell my friends about it yet, so you guys get to hear first. I\'m not dying to get into something serious at the moment, but I won\'t complain if it ends up going somewhere.\n\nI think some part of me has known for a while that my last relationship was comphet. Leaving felt like such a monumental task. In some messed up way, this has been a blessing. I was thrust into a situation where the only reasonable option was to drop him like hot shit, which was kinda long overdue.\n\nParents are also way chiller than I thought they\'d be. I mentioned in my last post that they\'re kinda religious, but they chilled out a lot after I moved out. Faith is still a big part of their lives, but they\'re less into following the book to a T, and more into making the world a better place. My dad got really into virtue ethics and I think it\'s been good for him. I had a conversation with my mom about everything, and she has been nothing but supportive.\n\nWe had a girls day with her, my aunt, my friend, and my sister a couple of days before my appointment. Being surrounded by love made everything easier. Appointment went well, no complications, and everyone made sure I was taken care of while I recovered physically and emotionally. I can\'t even begin to tell you all how grateful I am. I feel like everything has gone as well as it possibly could\'ve in the wake of an absolute shit storm.\n\nAs for ex\'s family, holy shit. This isn\'t the first time this happened. Ex\'s cousin did almost the exact same thing, but his gf (now wife) kept the kid and married the shitbag. I\'ve been talking to her, but I don\'t want to air out all of her trauma and dirty laundry on the internet. Lots going on for her. If she gives me permission to talk about it here, I might update once the dust settles.\n\nI don\'t have much else to say, except to thank you all SO INCREDIBLY MUCH for giving me the kick in the ass I needed. I\'ve received so much kindness from this community, both in comments in DMs. There were so many comments I didn\'t get the chance to read, but everything I saw was so sweet. Not a single unkind word. I hope you all continue to be such gems. I hope the goodness you\'ve imparted onto my life comes back around. Thank you thank you thank you. :)\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Good riddance! Happy for you :)\n\nlosing those 180 lbs feels great\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It certainly does 😌 thank you!\n\n**Commenter 2:** okay surprise sapphic love story IS DEFINITELY what we are here for, just to clarify. i speak for the entire internet.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** LMAO thank you,, idk about love story just yet but my fingers are crossed just a tiny bit\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 3:** Protect your heart.., but that said, she can’t get you pregnant! Yay!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Lmao that\'s true! Neither of us want to risk losing what we\'ve had since childhood, so I\'m keeping my expectations completely neutral. We\'ve talked a bit about what a relationship would look like if we did have one, and we agree now is definitely not the time. For now, we\'re just enjoying being in each other\'s company. I\'m so lucky to have her regardless of how things play out :\')\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment regarding her throwaway account and how recently she started to post**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That\'s fair, I\'d probably think so too. I made this because I considered posting about my ex quite a while ago. Ex treated me more like a mother than a partner, totally incapable of taking care of himself, irresponsible with house duties, generally leaving everything to me despite us both being busy students with jobs. He played it down a lot whenever I\'d bring it up, and I believed him. It felt too mundane to post about, I thought I was just being dramatic. Ive lurked a few subs on this account since I made it. I do get it, though, reddit is full of slop these days. Hopefully this provides a bit more clarity\n\n**OOP responds to a longer [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nwfa0j/update_my_22f_birth_control_was_tampered_with_by/nhi6g1j/) regarding the book recommendations and how she is doing physically, mentally, and emotionally**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I\'ll definitely be checking out both of those books :) you are so kind. I\'m doing as alright as I possibly could be. Still busy with school, I think I\'d be drowning if I hadn\'t quit my job. I\'m fairly sure the only thing keeping me afloat right now is constantly being surrounded by people. If I were alone, it\'d be a much different story. I don\'t really feel safe when I\'m home alone, and it\'s hard for me to leave without one of my siblings/friends/parents. I\'m not quite ready for something like therapy yet. Wounds are still too fresh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sleep was definitely a hurdle at the beginning, but I think I\'m mostly past it now. The first few nights after I left I physically could not sleep for more than an hour and a half at a time. Like I was so tired but my body just wouldn\'t let me rest. I\'d wake up in a cold sweat (and for some reason a really stuffed nose?? this had never happened to me before) every time I managed to drift off. I had really vivid anxious dreams that usually involved falling from a great height at the end, and then I\'d wake up when I hit the ground. Not sure how much sense that made lol. They\'re less and less frequent every day, and now at least I can get back to sleep pretty quickly most of the time. Occasionally, if it\'s really bad, I smoke a little bit of weed. Usually that knocks me out lol. Never enough to become dependent, though, I\'m too scared of that\n&gt; \n&gt; Having my friend here helps, I definitely sleep a lot deeper when she stays the night. Even when she doesn\'t, though, just knowing that my parents are home makes me feel safe enough to sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; All told, I\'m slowly starting to feel like a person again. Things aren\'t perfect and peachy and normal, but hey, they rarely are. I\'m doing alright. Thank you again &lt;3\n\n**OOP on being safe and away from her ex**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah I\'m safe :) thanks for asking. I haven\'t blocked him in case he says anything incriminating, so far the texts and voicemails have just been begging and pleading for me to \"hear him out\" and \"try to work through this with him\" etc. no threats of violence (thankfully). I\'ve heard through the grapevine that he\'s gone off the rails a little bit. He got fired from his job (server at a kinda fancy restaurant) for freaking out customers, lingering around tables and making intense eye contact and asking inappropriate questions. I have a friend in one of his classes and he\'s shown up wearing extremely formal attire for some reason. I really hope he gets some help (for the sake of everyone around him) as much as I hate him. He\'s not violent for the time being but I feel like he\'s acting out in strange ways and it could go south quickly\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o1wat8/my_22f_birth_control_was_tampered_with_by_my/', 5510, 512, '2025-10-09 10:04:05', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

Recently, due to our work schedule, we have been unable to go out much. \n\nMy GF loves skiing (I\'m a newbie), hiking and climbing ( I can\'t do this due to my fear of height).\n\nFew weeks ago was her birthday. I bought her a necklace and proposed her to organize together a couple trip on the mountains ( I paid for it).\n\nThis was the schedule we came up with: \n\n\\- day 1: skiing separately. \n\n\\- day 2: skiing alone and visiting a particular tourist spot we saw on Internet in the evening. \n\n\\- day 3: hiking together while chatting. \n\n\\- day 4: visiting the town nearby. \n\n\\- day 5: visiting another tourist spot and, more in general, free time together. \n\n\\- day 6: go back home.\n\n1 week before our trip, she informed me that she had invited one of her friends and her BF to come with us ( she would pay for their hotel and they would pay for the rest). I was a bit upset because she didn\'t even ask me. Despite the schedule, this was how we spent the days:\n\n\\- day 1: skiing.\n\n\\- day 2: skiing.\n\n\\- day 3: hiking ( she talked to her friend the whole time).\n\n\\- day 4: skiing and visiting the town nearby as a group.\n\n\\- day 5: she found out there was a climbing spot nearby and decided to go there in the morning. She was supposed to come back at 13 but came back in the evening.\n\n\\- day 6: we went back home.\n\nDuring the whole trip I asked her multiple time if we could do something together as a couple and every time she told me we would spend the fifth day alone together. That didn\'t happen so we basically spent zero times together.\n\nI tried to let it go but once we got home she realized I was upset. She insisted so told her that I was happy she had fun but upset our couple trip became a group trip in which she either abandoned or ignored me. She got angry, claiming that since this was supposed to be her birthday trip, she had the right to decide what she wanted to do.\n\nAITA for being angry over what happened?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt; NTA\n\n&gt; She outright dismissed your feelings and decided to invite her friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; I get you’ve been together this long, but i don’t see how your relationship can improve after this.\n&gt;\n&gt; This trip was supposed to be for the two of you, and yet OTHERS joined in?

I read all your comments and advice yesterday.\n\nI went back home today and waited in the living room for her to come back. I was obviously still upset but I tried to stay calm and asked her how she felt about the trip and about what I had told her after we came back. She reiterated that she thought I was exaggerating and that the trip was a success and that everybody had fun. I reminded her that we had originally agreed this was supposed to be a trip for us to spend some time together. I asked her if she really thought that even under that pov the trip had been a success. She hesitated but said that we will have plenty of time to spend together in the future.\n\nI told her that I doubted it and showed her the engagement ring I had bought to propose for her. I explained that before the trip, I was sure she was the woman I would have loved to spend my whole life with, but that, after what happened, I reflected deeply on our relationship and realized that it wasn\'t working out. I explained how much I sacrificed for her in the past, only to be left alone when I needed help and how much what she did in the trip hurt me.\n\nShe tried to say something but I told her I was sick of listening to her and never being listened to. I told her I didn\'t want to listen to her now and probably not in the near future either.\n\nWe broke up.\n\nThe house is mine so she went to stay with a friend. \n\nI wanted to thank all the people who commented under the original post for the advice. Thank you and good bye.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Signal_Historian_456**\n\n&gt;You did the right thing. Did she just accept that you broke up and still thought she was right?

I had already pre-ordered and paid for 2 copies of the game, one for me and one for him. We specifically went to the midnight release because there was a free tote bag with each purchase. When we got to the front of the line we got our 2 copies of the game and our tote bag. As I am about to leave my boyfriend kindly asks the guy “could we get a second tote bag since we got 2 copies of the game?”. Which is not an unreasonable question but I knew it was 1 bag per purchase and I had previously told him that if he wanted a bag he should pre-order on his own. Well after the guy said no he snapped and started getting rude with the guy saying it was ridiculous, we were cheated and other in my opinion stupid things in a very rude and aggressive tone of voice. I told him “it’s not the time for this” and pulled him out of the store. Once we got to the car he got mad at me and told me how embarrassing it was to get pulled out of the store and how I should have let him handle it man to man. Now he won’t talk to me and every time I try to talk to him he says puts on this high pitched voice and imitates me saying “it’s not the time for this”. I didn’t mean to embarrass him but he was being rude and embarrassing me. Am I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE:\nI woke up the next morning with flowers on my nightstand and a note saying when I was awake to come out to the living room. When I went out I was greeted by breakfast and a super apologetic boyfriend. He said he was being immature and he was incredibly tired and shouldn’t have acted how he did. He apologized not only for acting that way but for how he reacted after the fact as well. We talked through why it hurt me and how we both could have handled the situation better. We spent the whole day playing the game and then went and used our 1 bag to get groceries and all is well. Thank you for everyone’s advice and perspective this whole situation opened a new level of communication for our relationship! \n\nUPDATE:\nMy boyfriend has never been like this before. This is not a repeated behavior. He is a very gentle and kind human and that’s why I was so taken aback by it. He was extremely tired since he had been up since 5am for work.

It wasn\'t a big deal to me so I just assumed we were all cool. Why is it okay for them to be in their underwear but not for me to wear my everyday clothes?\n\nAdditionally, one of them has a girlfriend who dresses exactly the same, if not more revealing than me. Very low cut shirts, short shorts, etc. It\'s totally fine that she dresses this way, but I don\'t get why she\'s fine but I\'m a \"slut\".\n\nAnd here\'s the kicker: I\'m in a long-distance relationship with my GIRLFRIEND. Because I\'m gay as fuck.\n\nWhat do I do? I don\'t feel like I\'m in the wrong but I am so uncomfortable with the idea of being around them KNOWING that they\'re thinking about how much of a \"slut\" I am and how I\'m desperately trying to sexually attract them.\n\n**tl;dr**: Roommates called called me a \"slut\" because of the way I dress, while both themselves and their girlfriend dress more revealingly. What do I do?\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I think next time you see one of them in boxers or shirtless you should say \"Dude, you\'re dressing pretty slutty today. That\'s so funny, you must be so desperate to hook up with someone in this house. Who is it?\" Then when they look at you like you grew two heads, laugh, inform them they\'re gross but you don\'t GAF because you wouldn\'t sleep with sniggering spineless morons even if you were into men.\n\n... I\'d let other people give actual good advice, but a lot of what\'s on offer so far seems to be along the lines of \"boys will be boys\" with a helpful side order of well maybe you do dress slutty. It\'s pretty sad that it\'s plum normal for men to objectify and demean women who are meant to be their friends. I wouldn\'t be friends with people who talked about me this way.\n\nETA: Maybe I was a bit vitriolic in this post, but the situation ground my gears!\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Hahahaha oh my god that\'s hilarious! The look on their face would be PRICELESS. I just walk into the room, sigh, and go \"Look dude, I know you\'re super desperate to sleep with me but it\'s not gonna happen so you can just stop dressing like a slut now.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah I guess I\'m just a little sad because I kinda liked these guys. It hurt to hear from people who I thought were my friends. But whatever, if anything my girlfriend got a kick out of it (\"they have no idea how wrong they are!\"). : )\n\n**Commenter 2:** I don\'t know if this applies to you at all but here goes. I\'ve heard this about me too several times over the years (29F here) even if Ive show less skin than the girl next to me. I\'m pretty voluptuous and quickly learned that what looks sporty or even classy on other girls seem to still come across as \"slutty\" or \"dressing up sexy\" when I wear it, shorts and tank tops def being on the list on what\'s been commented on. It\'s an unfortunate effect which I\'ve had to come to terms with. The good news is these childish notions seem to disappear as you grow older.\n\nAnd the best way to counter those sort of remarks is to hold your head high and stay confident with a dont-give-a-shit attitude. It\'s a learned skill but it\'s damn great.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I completely feel you. I have a lot of friends who have larger chests or who developed early, and I have nothing but sympathy for the shit these girls have to deal with. Aside from actual, literal back pain, they\'ve told me how much trouble they\'ve had buying clothes that don\'t look \"sexy\", and even when they\'re wearing very covered up clothing people will still manage to look at them in a sexual light.\n&gt; \n&gt; I\'m about average-sized so this doesn\'t really apply to me but I appreciate the advice! It\'s really unfair the way society treats girls with larger chests-it\'s not as if they can help it!\n\n**Commenter 3:** They think you are hot. They are attracted to you and are embarrassed that they find you so distracting, and are using bravado to try to make themselves feel better about it. I\'d call them out and tell them if you were a guy dressing that way they wouldn\'t care, and that it\'s them creating the issue, not you.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Haha oh man, that first part made me laugh. : ) If only they could have voiced it as a compliment to me instead!\n&gt; \n&gt; You\'re probably right about the last bit. I agree, it\'s just that I\'m kind of scared of saying that to their faces. Maybe I\'ll work up the courage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/cfTiMmErdB): **April 8, 2016 (three days later)**\n\nFirstly, I just wanted to thank you guys for being so sweet in the last thread. I was so stressed out and you guys made me laugh. : )\n\nFirst update was removed because I forgot a link, but I fixed it. Onto the update.\n\nBefore I posted, I was basically set on hiding awkwardly in my room or maybe dressing more conservatively when I left my room. After I saw all your responses, I was filled with a feminist, body-positive rage. These boys were not going to get away with slut shaming me.\n\nOf the three guys, I\'m closest with Tom (Boy 1/3), so I decided to talk to him individually. I heard him coming up the stairs and I just took a deep breath and walked out of my room, smiled, and asked if I could talk to him for a minute.\n\nHe came into my room and we were just making small talk. I shut the door, summoned all of my assertiveness, and said, \"So, I actually have something weird to talk to you about. I heard you guys talking about me the other day.\"\n\nI\'d like to say that I threw down with this boy, that I told him that sexism is not cool or funny and I won\'t put up with it and demand that he apologize. But instead I, um.\n\nI cried.\n\nA lot.\n\nI straight up just broke down, I couldn\'t even speak. Tom look absolutely devastated. He immediately apologized, said I wasn\'t supposed to hear any of that, but I wasn\'t really paying attention because I was just trying to get a grip on myself. There\'s nothing more awkward than crying in front of someone when you\'re \"not on that level\" yet.\n\nAnyway, I asked him if that was really what he thought of me. He said no, and that they were just being dumb, and that when Sam (Boy 2/3) brought it up he was really surprised and knew it was wrong but he didn\'t call him out on it. He said he should have, and he knew he should have, but he didn\'t want to make a big deal about it because Sam and Bob (Boy 3/3) were just joking around, even though they were being mean. He said it was shitty of him not to call them out and that by not saying anything and acting like it was funny, he allowed it to happen. He said that he has no excuse and he\'s sorry.\n\nThis checks out- from what I heard, it was mainly Sam and Bob saying the bad stuff. I said I knew they were just joking around but it made me feel horrible to be talked about that way, and that the sexism really slapped me in the face.\n\nHe agreed and said it was horrible, and he also said something like \"not that it\'s an excuse, but you\'re really pretty and I think thats why we were talking about you that way. none of us actually believed what we were saying but i think it was just wishful thinking and we were idiots about it.\"\n\nSo for all you guys who suggested that they were attracted to me- BINGO.\n\nI laughed and told Tom that I had a girlfriend. He said that was totally cool, and then looked embarrassed and said they must have looked like complete idiots bragging about how much I wanted to sleep with them. I agreed.\n\nTom asked if there was anything he could do to make up for it. I told him not to tell the other guys anything because I don\'t really want to talk about it anymore, but if they ever start talking about another person like that, even if it\'s not me, to speak up. He promised me he would and apologized about 9000000 more times and left.\n\nI heard him go into his room, and then immediately leave and go out the front door. I didn\'t think much of it and put my headphones in and played Trackmania for a while.\n\nLater that day I opened my door and there was a big cardboard box right outside my door. My first thought was that I\'d ordered something from amazon and forgot about it, but it looked like a used box that someone had repurposed and taped shut. I dragged it into my room and opened it.\n\nGuys. It was a bouquet of flowers and a cake with the word \"SORRY\" written on it.\n\nIf you\'re thinking that I cried for the second time in three hours, well . . . you\'re right.\n\nAnyway, I\'m sorry I didn\'t throw down with them like so many of you wanted. Unfortunately I am but a tiny creampuff. I\'m working a lot on being more assertive but in this scenario I handled it as best as I could. Confronting Tom about it was actually super scary, but I\'m proud of myself for bringing it up at all.\n\nI accept Tom\'s apology. He seemed genuine, and this does seem like a one-off shitty behavior situation. He\'s usually a pretty stand-up guy. The other guys . . . I don\'t know. To be honest, I wasn\'t super sold on them to start with, so I feel like I\'ll just continue to not pursue a friendship with them. And I\'ll continue to dress however I want. : )\n\nLastly, serious thanks to all of you for your responses. I was hesitant to post this on reddit because reddit can sometimes be . . . not so nice about women\'s issues. But yall are cool. &lt;3\n\n**tl;dr**: Talked to one of the boys about it, cried a lot, got cake.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** No matter what, you came out of this on top because you got free cake.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Moral of this story: cry more so that people give you cake.\n&gt; \n&gt; (You bet your ass I have the entire cake next to me right now and I\'ve just been eating it directly with a fork because I\'m an animal.)\n\n**Commenter 2:** Oh man, don\'t even worry about having a breakdown. Half the times I think I\'m about to be fierce and direct in facing someone I end up just crying in anxiety about the situation and blubbering out word garbage. Honestly, it seems like opening up to him may have really helped him understand you, and he\'ll hopefully have your back in the future.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** God, i totally feel you. If anyone ever confronts me I just break down. Like I\'m not trying to manipulate them by making them feel sorry for me, I genuinely just cry super easily!\n&gt; \n&gt; And yeah, I\'m really glad I did it this way. Aside from, you know. Not doing it in the first place. I can\'t imagine Tom having a better response.\n\n**Commenter 3:** \n\n&gt; So for all you guys who suggested that they were attracted to me- BINGO.\n\nIt\'s quite telling to me how displaying male attraction seems tied into mistreatment and degradation of said woman they\'re attracted to. And how so many guys seem to trip over themselves either excusing it or not calling this bullshit out.\n\nFree cake though.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah it\'s a weird feeling. Guiltily, I\'m kind of flattered that they think I\'m pretty. But it\'s also like. They expressed this by calling me a slut. So that sort of takes away from the flattery.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone in the last thread mentioned that this was just dumb young boy behavior, and I kinda hope so. Not that \"boys will be boys\" is an excuse, but more that I hope as they get older they realize that this kind of stuff makes people feel really bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ohkllh/overheard_roommates_2024m_talking_about_how/', 5290, 501, '2025-10-27 23:23:39', '2025-11-07 23:43:29');

I’m F25 and I’m honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I’m Hitler for standing my ground.\n\nSo, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.\n\nLast weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who’s… let’s say “spirited.” I love him, but he’s a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she’d keep an eye on him and that it’d just be for one night.\n\nThey show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it’s clear she wasn’t kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he’d pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he’s three, I get it … but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.\n\nShe rolls her eyes and goes, “He’s just exploring, he’s curious, it’s normal.” But she closes the office door anyway.\n\nCut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.\n\nHe pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower’s ventilation slots (I’m not kidding), yanked out my keyboard’s keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.\n\nWhen I tell you I went silent… I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, “Oh nooo,” in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, “You should’ve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.”\n\nI lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn’t supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.\n\nShe told me to “calm down” and said that “he’s just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.” I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn’t have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn’t acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.\n\nShe left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I’m being “materialistic” and should understand that my nephew didn’t mean it. My dad said I should’ve “locked the door” if it was that important. My brother actually said, “Why do you even need three monitors anyway? That’s kind of overkill.”\n\nI’ve filed a claim with my insurance but there’s no guarantee it’ll be covered since it was technically “guest damage.” I also told her that if she does not pay up, I\'ll take her to court for what happened.\n\nNow I’m getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for “blaming her kid for being curious.” I told her I’d drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements … or at least met me halfway … and she BLOCKED me.\n\nSo… Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?\n\nUPDATE: Wow. Just wow. Four hours later, I wake up from my nap to this. Thank you guys, it\'ll take a bit for me to read all of this.\n\nMy sister still has not unblocked me, but her husband reached out to find out what happened. I\'m sorry I don\'t have more to tell yet, but I\'ll update again when I do. Seriously, thanks for the insights everyone. My head is a lot clearer now ❤️\n\n**Update 2 (Same Post): Another 4 hours later**\n\nUPDATE2: Hey all. My sister’s husband reached out as mentioned earlier, and we’re working out a solution if possible. He’s been really understanding as have all of you.\n\nAlso, to clarify the office situation: my one-bedroom apartment is on the smaller side (33m2/355sq ft?), so the landlord converted an old ex-clothes cabinet into a makeshift ’office.’ It’s weird, but the building is from the 40s, and ig they had to get creative with the space with an old tenant or something. So its living room (sister and her kid slept there) + kitchen (i slept there) + the ’office.’\n\nThanks for all the support. And the award. I really don\'t have the words for how nice people have been in both DMs and the comments. ❤️‍🩹\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\n*OOP responds to one of the top* [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jwo74t/comment/mml4rza/?context=3):\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I really appreciate your comment, I feel as if you nailed exactly how I’ve been feeling but couldn’t articulate in the moment.  \nIt’s comforting to know I’m not totally off-base here. I will need to see what I’m willing to do with this situation, I don’t want to lose my family, but I don’t want to start begging to be heard either.  \nThank you. ❤️\n\n*Going no contact:*\n\n&gt;Yeah, I’m not ready to go full no contact right now, but I really appreciate your perspective.  \nIt’s definitely something I’ll keep in mind if things keep escalating and no one starts showing even a little respect for my boundaries.  \nI just want accountability, not drama. But if they keep pushing, I won’t hesitate to step back. I don\'t think I want to know my family if they can’t appreciate the work I put into my hobbies.  \nThanks for the insight. ❤️\n\nCommenter (downvoted): Questions -\n\n1. does your office door lock, if so why wasn\'t it locked?\n2. how was this unattended 3 year old able to get his hands on crackers &amp; apple juice in an apartment that he is presumably not familiar with? Why were these items so easy for him to get to?\n3. if you knew in advance that he &amp; your sister were coming, why wouldn\'t you make *any* effort to either secure delicate/important items or move them somewhere he can\'t reach?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** 1. The “office” is a converted clothes closet. The apartment’s from the 40s and has a weird layout. There’s no lock on the door, the door is just a heavy old one. Tbh I’ve been wondering if my sister might have opened it for him. I just don\'t get why??? 2. The crackers and juice weren’t mine, sister brought them. I had no idea he had access to them during the night until after the fact. 3. I didn’t get much notice. I saw her message around 10AM Saturday, and they arrived around 2PM. My place was a mess, so I spent most of that time cleaning before they came by. In hindsight, yeah, I should’ve been more cautious with my setup, but it didn’t even cross my mind that anything like this would happen as I thought the office area was inaccessible to him. What he did pull off of the shelves was moved higher up and out of reach and in an area where he could be kept an eye on.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)**: April 16, 2025 (5 days later)**\n\nHey again.\n\nJust wanted to post a quick update since it’s been a little under a week and a few people asked what happened next. Things are better, pretty fucking weird, and still ongoing, but here’s where we\'re at.\n\nLast Saturday, my brother-in-law (BIL) came over to check out the damage himself. He actually brought Max (toddler) with him, which I was almost livid about at first, but he had a reason. He asked Max to try opening the office/closet door. The kid couldn’t do it. The door was too heavy for him.\n\nYou probably can guess where this is going. :=)\n\nBIL offered to take my PC to the store that originally built it for me, just to see what was fixable. I agreed, but asked for something in writing just so I had some peace of mind. We put together a little agreement that he’d be responsible for it while it was with him. Yeah, yeah, it was just a formality and would not hold much merit anywhere, but it helped me feel a bit more in control.\n\nOn Monday, he dropped it off at the shop and gave them my number so they could keep me updated. He also told me he confronted my sister about how things played out. I sent him my original Reddit post too, he read the comments and apparently showed them to her. She still hasn’t unblocked me, and from what I’ve heard, was not happy about the fact my BIL is actually listening to me.\n\nI also shared the post and some comments with my parents and brother since no one really believed me before. My parents still don’t fully get it, but they’ve at least stopped pushing back. My brother is more understanding now, though for some reason he mostly wanted to talk about how many people saw the post. I don\'t think either of those three still care, really, and I\'m fine if they see this. Do better.\n\nAnyway, I went to see the PC today (wednesday here). The shop said it’s mostly salvageable. It needs a very very careful internal clean and a few fans replaced, and some wiring fixed, but overall the main parts survived somehow. BIL told me he’ll cover the cost of the repair, no hesitation.\n\nWhen I brought up what my sister said about not being able to pay even $200, he said she’s lying. He also said he’s not sure Max actually did all the damage. He thinks the door was left open on purpose, or that my sister might have even done some of it herself. Based on the height of the tower and where the crackers ended up, it didn’t quite add up to a toddler acting alone.\n\nApparently, she’s been telling him I have a “gambling addiction” (I did get a bit hooked on Genshin like 4 years ago I guess?) and that maybe this whole thing will “wake me up,” which is… new. She used to be supportive or at least indifferent. No idea where that switch came from.\n\nSo yeah. That’s where we’re at:\n\n* My PC is being cleaned up and fixed, and BIL is covering the cost.\n* Sister still has me blocked and won’t talk to me. Still tempted to start something with her tbh, especially if she actually did all of this on purpose.\n* Still not ruling out small claims court depending on how things go.\n\nThanks again to everyone who responded to the original post. Seeing how many people understood what happened really helped me hold the line with my family when I felt like I was losing my mind.\n\nOne thing I’ve been turning over in my head lately is what if my sister *did* do something to my setup on purpose?\n\nI don’t want to believe that, it feels like a stretch, but the more I think about it, the less so, I guess...? But then I remember how she acted when I asked her to keep Max out of the office. The eye-roll and the \"he\'s just curious\" comments like she didn’t take any of it seriously...??? And now hearing from my BIL that she’s been saying I have a “crippling gambling/gaming/whatever addiction” and needed to “grow up”????\n\nIt’s just… weird. She used to be cool about it. Never super into games herself, but she got that it was important to me. If something changed, I don’t know when or why. And if this was some weird way to make a point or “teach me a lesson”… that’s messed up. You\'re not our mom. How about talking first instead of this? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but the more I think about it, the less it makes sense that Max could’ve done all of that alone. It\'s sick if she blamed her own son for it.\n\nSo yeah. Not accusing anyone outright, but that thought is there now.\n\nAnd if you\'re my sister reading this… Which I\'m guessing you are, because I bet you\'d love to look at the comments that are on your side a lot. :)))\n\nI don’t know why you blocked me. I don’t know what shifted in your head about all this. But if you actually had anything to do with damaging my setup whether it was on purpose or just through complete carelessness... Fuck. You. You know I worked hard for that. You know what that rig meant to me, and you know I would never do something like this to your stuff.\n\nAnd if Max really did all of it on his own… I hope you’re paying closer attention now. Not for my sake, but for his. Read the comments on my first post again, from other parents and people with younger siblings who CLEARLY know better than you. That\'s all.\n\nThanks for reading, those who did.\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Wait - I thought the whole family was blowing up your phone telling you how mean you were?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Yes a week ago, before my first post. Is there something I can clarify for you here? My sister was talking incredible smack about me to them, making it seem like I ”screamed at her child” over a ”minor mistake.” I do see the people going ”haha blowing up her phone” and I do not understand what is wrong with the wording?\n\nCommenter: I think chatgpt is being used a lot on Reddit lately, especially in AITA type subs and a common indicator that it’s a fake post is that AI always uses the “blowing up my phone” phrase so that’s probably why they’re questioning it\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Ohh… I see. 🤣 Thank you for clarifying! Beep, boop.\n\nCommenter: I’m really glad things are turning for the better. But what about the other damages (Gaming chair, keyboard, etc)?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** My chair is okay, the cushion, legs and back are stained with red permanent marker but I’ve learned to live with it. Coworkers and I are trying to find a chemical to fix the situation on the cushions, but an ethanol solution (small amounts, i dont want to ruin the chair further) has slowly been working at cleaning the other parts. (being a janitor does have its perks)  \nKeyboard… ehh. I could not find all of the keycaps that were pulled off. I replaced the missing ones with an old keyboard’s ones (both mechanical) so it’s a bit awkward but it works for now. I might get custom ones for it if I find some that fit.  \nThe cracked monitor on the other hand needs to be replaced. I guess calling it ”cracked” was a kindness in itself. Still got the other two left and at least it wasnt the most expensive one… but yeah. 3:\n\nCommenter: Um, why aren\'t you just having your bil pay for a new keyboard and monitor? Or professional cleaning for the chair? That\'s all part of the repairs.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** We are waiting to see if my sister confesses to anything. If so, she will be paying out of her own pocket (and paying back), not my BIL. If she confesses and refuses, then, well… 👨‍⚖️📝🔒  \nThe computer is essential, but the keyboard works and I still have two monitors. Thats why I am willing to wait for the other damage to be solved.\n\n*The \'addiction\':*\n\n&gt;I\'ll admit, during covid, I did spend $300 on Ganyu when she came out, but that was the ’worst’ of it. (And it was so worth it)  \nI don\'t play much anymore, (mostly stuck on Marvel Rivals rn) but the overall margin from Genshin release to this day I\'ve spent under $600.  \nI get it, even that might look crazy to people who don\'t play video games, but sheesh. GAMBLING addiction…? Bruh.  \nShe should be more concerned of what I spend on Pokemon packs in this economy, if she\'s gotta be concerned over something. 🤣🤣🤣\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kds0zk/my_25f_sister_30f_is_spiraling_but_i_dont_know/) **2: May 3, 2025 (over 2 weeks later, 3 from OG post)**\n\n**Title:** My \\[25F\\] sister \\[30F\\] is spiraling but I don’t know how or if I should help.\n\nA few weeks ago, I made a post (not here) about how my sister’s toddler \\[3M\\] almost destroyed my PC setup. Long story short, she and her son were staying with me for one night, he got into my office, and the whole setup got wrecked with juice and cracker bits shoved into the tower. The situation was awful, and when I asked my sister for help covering the damage, she made an excuse and blamed me instead.\n\nIt became whole family drama. My sister blocked me and acted like the whole thing was my fault, but her husband (my BIL) reached out on his own. He checked the damage himself, helped take the PC in for repairs, and ended up covering the costs because he was genuinely embarrassed by the way she acted. He even started questioning whether their toddler could have done that much damage on his own, especially after the kid couldn’t even open the door by himself. My BIL thought maybe my sister left it open or did something herself.\n\nWithin a week of that, my BIL confronted her and well, she kicked him out of the house. Like, full-on, told him to get the hell out, packed up his things, dumped them and left them by the curb like he was a stray dog. He told me she screamed that he was “betraying her” and “taking the side of that fucking Reddit bitch,” meaning me. She also apparently accused him of conspiring and cheating on her with me to “humiliate her publicly,” which… What???\n\nShe hasn’t let him see their kid since. No visits. No phone calls. She’s gone full black hole mode and is completely unreachable, threatening cops if he goes near. She’s blocked me, my brother, even some extended family, and is only talking to our parents, who are still enabling her but I think its only so they can keep Max at arm’s lenght.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m hearing rumors she’s been telling people I’m unhinged, psychotic, and that I made the whole thing up. She told one of our cousins that I “lured” her kid into the office like some kind of trap or setup.\n\nI don’t know if this is postpartum-related, or if something snapped, or if she’s just always been this vindictive and I didn’t want to see it. But I’m scared. Scared for her kid. Scared for her husband. And yeah I’m also scared for myself, because if she’s willing to ruin her whole marriage and turn the family against me just to protect a lie…?\n\nMy parents want to keep it under wraps, but I know my BIL wants to get her help. I want to get her help too, but I don’t know where to start or what to do.\n\nWhat can I start with to possibly push her towards someone who can help her out? Has someone here dealt with a situation like this before? I feel helpless, as I know she is an adult and has free-will but I fear for her safety and my nephew’s safety as well…\n\nMy BIL voiced wanting to divorce her and told my parents he will get his son whether they approve or not. His side of the family is furious with mine and I’ve no idea where I stand because yeah, I guess I started this.\n\nIs this salvageable? If so, how? What can I do? Who can I contact within the states…? Is there anything I can do even? Does anyone know?\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**LhasaApsoSmile:** I think your parents need to talk to her because this is crazy. The kid did what 3 yo\'s do but she failed as a mother by not minding him. Your BIL stepped up to fix it. But her reaction is nuts. There has to be more here. I think your parents are in a better place to figure out what is going on.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Jelly-6298/comments/1lk9axs/a_brief_underwhelming_update_aio/) **3: June 25, 2025 (over 1.5 months from previous post, 2.5 from OG)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nIt’s been a while, so I didn’t want to post this on AIO, but for those still interested in my situation, here’s an update. :)\n\nThe good news first:\n\n* My PC is fully functional again. The store was able to recover it!\n* My nephew is now in a safe and stable environment with my brother-in-law.\n\nUnfortunately, there have also been some difficult developments:\n\n* My brother-in-law is currently in the process of separating from my sister.\n* It seems I’ve essentially been disowned by my mother, and now, it appears, by my father as well. The only one still in contact with me is my brother.\n\nThank you to those who have checked in or supported me during all this. It truly means a lot.\n\n***OOP\'s Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Good to hear things are fixed with th pc now, but that\'s awful that you\'ve been disowned by your parents. Why did they do that? Unless I\'m remembering wrong, they were only in contact with her to have access to their grandkid.\n\nSounds like you\'re in the middle of a lot right not so I won\'t push, but I wish you luck. Just know that people are on your side and are praying for you 🙏\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Thank you! I am very happy to hear that.  \nMy parents have unfortunately been swayed by my sister\'s lies. I guess I can say that she is of the mind that BIL was cheating on her with me and that we want to \"steal her son.\" I am still trying to cope with what has happened (poorly, but work and studies keep me busy thankfully...) and to clear the air.  \nThere is a lot happening as you guessed, but I\'ll give out more updates after everything settles down. Right now I\'m just taking it one day at a time.\n\nCommenter: I\'m glad your nephew is safe! Try to keep that connection - he\'ll appreciate it in the future.\n\nI wish you the best of luck with the rest of the family. It\'s not your fault &amp; you need to work to accept that. Maybe find a therapist to talk this thru with? You need to protect your mental health. I\'m also a younger sister &amp; I took on way too much of trying to fix things when I was your age.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Thank you for the advice! Therapy hadn\'t even crossed my mind... I\'ll look into it for sure!\n\n# New Update\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Final Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nw3wjd/final_update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my/)**: October 2, 2025 (3.5 months later, 6 from OG post)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nHey everyone. This is the final update to my posts on [r/AmIOverreacting](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/) :\n\n* [AIO for threatening to take my sister to court after her toddler destroyed my $2,000 gaming setup because she said I should’ve “baby-proofed my apartment”?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jwo74t/aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to_court/)\n* [\\[UPDATE\\] AIO for threatening to take my sister to court after her toddler destroyed my $2,000 gaming setup because she said I should’ve “baby-proofed my apartment”?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)\n\nIt’s been a long while since I last posted, and honestly I wasn’t sure if I wanted to give another update at all. A lot has happened over the past six months, some of it good, some of it really heavy, and some of it that I’m still struggling to process. But I know a lot of you followed the whole thing from the beginning and my direct messages have been full of so many awesome, supportive people, I feel as if I owe all of you a final update before letting this matter go.\n\nFirst, the positives: My PC is alive and well and has been for a while. The shop did a miracle job restoring it and it’s running beautifully again. It almost feels symbolic now, like after everything blew up in my life, at least this one thing that mattered to me is still standing. xd\n\nI’ve also gotten closer to my brother-in-law (well, ex-BIL now, I guess, though it feels weird to call him that since he’s still family to me). He has full custody of my nephew, and that little kid is thriving. He’s calmer, happier, and honestly just a joy to be around in ways I didn’t even realize before. And he turned four *after* all the court stuff ended, so we could have his birthday in peace!!! :)\n\nMy BIL has his own family helping him, and I’ve been pitching in too whenever I can. It’s exhausting at times, but I don’t regret a second of it. My nephew deserves stability, and my BIL deserves support after everything he’s had to go through. Watching him step up as a single dad has been inspiring.\n\nNow for the complicated part: my family.\n\nWhen things first went down, my parents were still on my sister’s side, and I was basically the black sheep. But something happened during the legal proceedings that made them realize she wasn’t well and that I hadn’t been exaggerating about any of it. For the first time in what feels like forever, they stopped defending her blindly. They actually reached out to me, apologized, and admitted they’d been wrong... well, kind of. But I couldn\'t be asked to escalate it again. It’s been slow, but they’ve been trying to rebuild things with me. Part of me resents that it took them *this much* to finally see the truth, but I’m also relieved not to be completely estranged from my parents anymore. I\'m still trying to decide what kind of a relationship they deserve to have with me after all of this.\n\nAs for my sister…\n\nI don’t even know how to start. During the custody battle, she completely broke down. A lot of stuff came out, including the fact that she had broken and damaged other people’s things in the past (friends, her coworker\'s stuff), intentionally. She admitted she did it because, in her words, BIL “owed her more” as the mother of their child, and destroying things was her way of “making him notice her.”\n\nShe also said something else that stuck with me: that when she broke things, she felt powerful. She said people underestimated her, ignored her, treated her like she was just “a mom.” But when she destroyed something, she knew she couldn’t be ignored. It forced people to react, and it sure did. I know some of the people witnessing this in real time still pity her, which... I don\'t know how to feel about it.\n\nStill, it explains so much of her behavior, not just with the PC, but with her marriage, with our family and how she’s spiraled. She wanted to feel like she mattered, but instead of asking for help in a healthy way or seeking support, she turned to control and destruction. And when that wasn’t enough, she escalated.\n\nWriting that out makes me feel so sad, honestly. It’s like everything I suspected about the PC wasn’t just a suspicion. And to think all of this could have been avoided if she sought help or accepted going to couple\'s therapy properly. Apparently my BIL had suggested it a few times to her, but she declined.\n\nAfter she lost custody of my nephew, things spiraled fast. She had a complete breakdown, and long story short, she’s now in jail awaiting transfer to a psychiatric facility. I don’t want to go into every detail, but it’s safe to say it’ll be a long time before I see her again. Or want to see her again.\n\nAnd here’s the part I can’t quite make peace with: I feel bad for her.\n\nI know that might sound crazy after everything she put me through, after how she tore our family apart, and after what she did to her own son. But she’s still my sister. There’s this ache I can’t quite get rid of, because I don’t know if the person she is now is who she always was, or if something in her just snapped along the way. I look back on our childhood and teenage years and wonder if there were signs that I missed, if there was some pattern of behavior I brushed off as moodiness or sibling rivalry that was actually something worse.\n\nWhat complicates those feelings even more is everything that happened after my posts started spreading. I never expected them to blow up the way they did. I just wanted an outside perspective because my whole family was gaslighting me, making me feel insane for protecting my own belongings. And then, suddenly, it was everywhere. On Twitter, YouTube, Tiktok, even some news article was made about it. Someone tagged me to let me know that Smosh had even featured my story, which was surreal and honestly sort of humiliating in its own way. (Even though being noticed was kind of cool, I guess?)\n\nStrangers were debating my family like it was some kind of reality TV show, and I had no control over it. At first, I was grateful for the validation, but over time, it started to eat away at my conscience. Keeping my posts public turned out to be a mistake.\n\nI know hindsight is 20/20, but I regret not locking them down sooner. By the time BIL’s lawyer told us it would be best to hide everything, the damage had already been done. My sister had already seen the comments and the full force of the internet turned against her. And she hyperfixated on it.\n\nThat is not just me speculating either, one of our cousins told me she would rant constantly about it during the legal proceedings, always bringing it back to the posts and how I had “publicly humiliated her.” Apparently, she would spend hours scrolling, trying to dig up my posts, looking for new comments, even after I hid them. It was like pouring salt in a wound, and she couldn’t stop picking at it.\n\nI keep asking myself if I made things worse by letting it all stay up as long as it did. If I gave her more ammunition for her paranoia orr if I pushed her further toward the breakdown that ended with her losing everything. Part of me feels like I failed her, like maybe if I had been more careful, she wouldn’t have spiraled so badly. But then another part of me reminds myself that it wasn’t the internet that broke her, it was something already inside her. The posts didn’t cause her to smash my PC, or to lash out at BIL, or to neglect her own child. Those were choices she made long before Reddit ever came into the picture.\n\nI realize there’s no point in deleting them. Even if I scrubbed my entire account clean, the internet never forgets. Copies are out there somewhere, archived and dissected on forums I’ll never even see. I can’t control that, no matter how much I might want to. What I can control is how I move forward, how I take care of myself, my nephew, and the family I still have.\n\nThe truth is, moving forward has been a mixed bag. On one hand, my daily life feels lighter without the constant chaos of my sister’s presence. I’m not coming home to find something broken, I’m not waking up to accusatory texts, and I’m not walking on eggshells waiting for the next outburst. That alone has been a kind of freedom I didn’t realize how badly I needed. On the other hand, there’s this strange emptiness where she used to be. Even if her presence was destructive, she was still there, part of the fabric of my family, and now there’s just this jagged hole.\n\nMy nephew asks about her sometimes. He doesn’t fully understand what happened, of course. He just knows “mommy is sick” and can’t take care of him right now. BIL and I try to keep our answers simple, but the truth is, I don’t know what kind of relationship, if any, he’ll be able to have with her in the future. I think about that a lot, because no matter how much I’ve been hurt by her, I can’t help but imagine what it’ll feel like for him one day when he’s old enough to learn the truth. How do you explain to a child that their mother did what my sister has done? How can it ever make sense to him? I don\'t know what to do when the day comes that either BIL or I have to explain what happened.\n\nAs for me, I’ve been in therapy since all of this started (recommended by some of the lovely people in the comments and in my direct messages, thank you.) At first, it was just a way to vent, but it’s become essential, to be honest. My therapist keeps reminding me that none of this is my fault and that my sister’s choices were her own, that I didn’t “ruin her life” by posting about the PC, and that it’s not my job to fix her. I hope to one day believe everything that my therapist is telling me.\n\nAs for my sister, I don’t know what the future holds for her, or if she’ll ever get better.\n\nBut if anyone else has problems like this, maybe be a bit more careful than I was. I spent the last months worrying I\'d get charged with something for causing emotional turmoil over a Reddit post.\n\nOn a positive note, the stress caused me to get reconnected with an old hobby, retro electronics! Did you know the 3DS is considered retro now? I didn\'t! I feel old! I\'m the same age as Pokemon Crystal!!!\n\nAnyways, from now on I will be focusing on graduating and working to help my BIL pay off the debt that accumulated during the legal proceedings/investigation. But now that it\'s over, it\'s nice to know that at least for the coming months, things should be peaceful for me and those who matter the most to me. :)\n\nThank you to everyone who followed this from the beginning. ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:***\n\nCommenter: The only thing I can tell you is that you\'re not wrong for feeling bad for your sister. **This is not advice that you should forgive her**, to be clear. But she was (and is, debatably!) an important part of your life, feeling bad for her is normal empathy for your loved ones. I hope she finds a way to process her mental issues and is able to authentically and meaningfully make amends to you and your family.\n\nRegarding posting everything online: I mean, yeah, with the benefit of hindsight, it probably would have been better to delete the posts as soon as you got the insight you needed, but that seal is already long-since broken. Deleting at this point is no good, given how many times it\'s been reposted/commentated on.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Thank you, you really hit the nail on the head. I’m not ready to forgive, but I can still feel for her. It’s a weird, heavy mix of emotions. I appreciate your thoughtful words and hope for healing, however long it takes. :)\n\nCommenter: What an update ! \\[...\\] And did you ever find out if your nephew actually touched your PC, or it was all done by your sister (the crackers, apple juice...) ?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Yes, I guess Reddit really does love a \"saga\" like this. And yes, all the crackers and juice were 100% my sister. -\\_- ...Thank you for your kind words!\n\nCommenter: \\[...\\] Also, don’t feel bad about blogging about this. It may have added fuel to your sister’s struggle…but if you hadn’t either (a) she would have found something else to be paranoid about/obsess over (as is common in mental health issues) or (b) may have been able to continue sweeping her issues under the rug and never gotten the help she needs.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** That’s a really thoughtful perspective. You’re right, if it hadn’t been the posts, it might’ve been something else. I appreciate the reassurance and your kindness. Thank you!\n\n*Therapy for nephew and forgive yourself:*\n\n&gt;I agree, therapy has already helped me a lot, and I’m looking into it for my nephew too. (I believe my BIL may have been recommended something after the court case for custody ended?) Thank you for the reminder to forgive myself, that part is a work in progress. I’ll try to update down the road if things shift more, maybe in a few years at least. I\'m a bit over the internet right now. xd\n\nCommenter: \\[...\\]Side Note: Out of curiosity -- what is the PC that you got and the monitors?

Original post by u/E_lluminate in r/[ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/)\n\nCredit to u/Direct-Caterpillar77 for reminding me about this one.\n\nMood Spoilers: &gt;!Satisfying!&lt;\n\n[**Opposing Counsel Just Filed a ChatGPT Hallucination with the Court**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n7ucjj/opposing_counsel_just_filed_a_chatgpt/) \\- September 3, 2025\n\nTLDR; opposing counsel just filed a brief that is 100% an AI hallucination. The hearing is on Tuesday.\n\nI\'m an attorney practicing civil litigation. Without going to far into it, we represent a client who has been sued over a commercial licensing agreement. Opposing counsel is a collections firm. Definitely not very tech-savvy, and generally they just try their best to keep their heads above water. Recently, we filed a motion to dismiss, and because of the proximity to the trial date, the court ordered shortened time for them to respond. They filed an opposition (never served it on us) and I went ahead and downloaded it from the court\'s website when I realized it was late.\n\nI began reading it, and it was damning. Cases I had never heard of with perfect quotes that absolutely destroyed the basis of our motion. I like to think I\'m pretty good at legal research and writing, and generally try to be familiar with relevant cases prior to filing a motion. Granted, there\'s a lot of case law, and it can be easy to miss authority. Still, this was absurd. State Supreme Court cases which held the exact opposite of my client\'s position. Multiple appellate court cases which used entirely different standards to the one I stated in my motion. It was devastating.\n\nThen, I began looking up the cited cases, just in case I could distinguish the facts, or make some colorable argument for why my motion wasn\'t a complete waste of the court\'s time. That\'s when I discovered they didn\'t exist. Or the case name existed, but the citation didn\'t. Or the citation existed, but the quote didn\'t appear in the text.\n\nI began a spreadsheet, listing out the cases, the propositions/quotes contained in the brief, and then an analysis of what was wrong. By the end of my analysis, I determined that every single case cited in the brief was inaccurate, and not a single quote existed. I was half relieved and half astounded. Relieved that I didn\'t completely miss the mark in my pleadings, but also astounded that a colleague would file something like this with the court. It was utterly false. Nothing-- not the argument, not the law, not the quotes-- was accurate.\n\nThen, I started looking for the telltale signs of AI. The use of em dashes (just like I just used-- did you catch it?) The formatting. The random bolding and bullet points. The fact that it was (unnecessarily) signed under penalty of perjury. The caption page used the judges nickname, and the information was out of order (my jurisdiction is pretty specific on how the judge\'s name, department, case name, hearing date, etc. are laid out on the front page). It hit me, this attorney was under a time crunch and just ran the whole thing through ChatGPT, copied and pasted it, and filed it.\n\nThis attorney has been practicing almost as long as I\'ve been alive, and my guess is that he has no idea that AI will hallucinate authority to support your position, whether it exists or not. Needless to say, my reply brief was unequivocal about my findings. I included the chart I had created, and was very clear about an attorney\'s duty of candor to the court.\n\nThe hearing is next Tuesday, and I can\'t wait to see what the judge does with this. It\'s going to be a learning experience for everyone.\n\n***EDIT***\n\nHe just filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.\n\n***EDIT #2***\n\nThe hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel is set for the same day as the hearing on the motion to dismiss. He\'s not getting out of this one.\n\n***EDIT #3***\n\nI must admit I came away from the hearing a bit deflated. The motion was not successful, and trial will continue as scheduled. Opposing counsel (who signed the brief) did not appear at the hearing. He sent an associate attorney who knew nothing aside from saying \"we\'re investigating the matter.\" The Court was very clear that these were misleading and false statements of the law, and noted that the court\'s own research attorneys did not catch the bogus citations until they read my Reply. The motion to be relieved as counsel was withdrawn.\n\nThe court did, however, set an Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") hearing in October as to whether the court should report the attorney to the State Bar for reportable misconduct of “Misleading a judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law or offering evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, section 6086, subd. (d); California Rule of Professional Responsibility 3.3, subd. (a)(1), (a)(3).)”\n\nThe OSC is set for after trial is over, so it will not have any impact on the case. I had hoped to have more for all of you who expressed interest, but it looks like we\'re waiting until October.\n\n***Edit#4***\n\nIf you\'re still hanging on, we won the case on the merits. The same associate from the hearing tried the case himself and failed miserably. The OSC for his boss is still slated for October. The court told the associate to look up the latest case of AI malfeasance, [Noland v. Land of the Free, L.P.](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2025/b331918.html) prior that hearing.\n\n**Additional context in comments**\n\n**Commentator 1:**\n\n&gt;*He just filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.*  \nOn what basis?\n\n**OP:**\n\n&gt;He says it\'s irreconcilable differences with his client. I have my doubts.\n\n**Further down the comment chain**\n\n&gt;I know from your postings that you\'re super excited about seeing this one go down. But I\'d be really hesitant to go hard on the guy at the hearing. The facts and briefs should speak for themselves. You probably don\'t get a whole lot for your client by really dunking on the guy at the hearing. The Court should do that for you. Or, in any case, understands what\'s happening and doesn\'t likely need you going all scorched earth to make its decision.\n\n&gt;The other thing to consider is that this other attorney may still keep practicing. You may see him again. And while you may be within your rights to really dunk on him, he may not forget you going the extra mile to really stick it to him. Is it worth it? You probably already won. It may be, but I\'m not sure.\n\n**OP:**\n\n&gt;You\'re absolutely right. I have no intention of \"dunking\" on him. I gave the court the information it needs to do reach its conclusion. There is nothing more that can be gained from making a spectacle. My main point of interest is seeing how the court approaches this.\n\n**Commentator:**\n\n&gt;\"...that the lawyer knows to be false.\" is so annoying when it comes to passing along AI slop: \"I didn\'t know it was false -- I trusted the AI.\"\n\n**OP:**\n\n&gt;I do want to note that the court had a typo in its order. The Bus. and Prof. Code section the court is referring to is 6068.\n\n&gt;But the court is citing the Rules of Professional Responsibility, 3.3, in which, \"knows\" is a defined term.  \nPer the rules:\n\n&gt; &gt; \"Knowingly,” “known,” or “knows” means actual knowledge of the fact in question. A person’s* knowledge may be inferred from circumstances.\n\n&gt;I think, here, we can infer that the use of AI without checking the sources would still fall under \"known\" but that\'s not an argument for us to make.\n\n[**\\[UPDATE\\] Opposing Counsel Just Filed a ChatGPT Hallucination with the Court**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o7m7fy/update_opposing_counsel_just_filed_a_chatgpt/) \\- October 15, 2025\n\nI can\'t believe it\'s already been a month since my original post, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n7ucjj/opposing_counsel_just_filed_a_chatgpt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).\n\nAs a quick recap: opposing counsel filed a brief with the court that was 100% an AI hallucination. Every cite, every case, every quote was entirely fabricated. The arguments were fantastic, but the law was bogus. I made the court aware of the issue in my responding brief. The court issued an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for why the attorney should not be reported to the state bar.\n\nNow, for the update: The court held the OSC, and the attorney appeared in person and was plainly remorseful. He was older (had been practicing for over 35 years) and it was clear he felt bad about the whole thing. He told the court that a junior associate who was no longer with the firm had submitted the brief to him, he had signed it without looking, and was unaware of the issue until he sent a (different) attorney to argue the motion at the hearing.\n\nThe court seemed torn. On the one hand, there was a lack of supervision of the younger attorney, the cases cited were clearly misleading, and the attorney wasn\'t even paying enough attention to withdraw the brief when it was brought to the court\'s attention. On the other hand, he was remorseful, had no history of discipline with the state bar, and had taken remedial measures (aka firing the offending attorney).\n\nIn the end, the court sanctioned him $750 (below the threshold for reporting to the state bar), payable to the court clerk, ordered that he send apology letters to both us and his client, and ordered that he file the proofs of service with the court. While not the absolute beating the court could have dished out based on the appellate court\'s ruling in [Noland v. Land of the Free, L.P.](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2025/b331918.html) (which the court cited in its OSC) it was commensurate with the harm.\n\nWhile the OSC was still pending, we ended up going to trial, and won the case on the merits. I think that may have had some bearing on the court\'s ruling, as we were in no way prejudiced by the offending brief.\n\nI guess, at the end of the day, all is well that ends well. Everyone lived to fight another day, and we all learned a valuable lesson. Always check your cites.\n\n**Additional Comments**\n\n**Commentator:**\n\n&gt;What\'s the chance he was lying about the other attorney doing it?\n\n**OP:**\n\n&gt;Doubtful. He was older, and probably had no idea what AI was, much less ever used it. Either he was a very good liar, or he was genuinely remorseful over the whole issue. The court seemed to think the latter, and I tend to agree.\n\n**Commentator:**\n\n&gt;What happened to the junior attorney? Seems the sanction was fair for the supervisor, who didn’t knowingly submit an untrue brief, but the junior should clearly face worse sanctions.\n\n**OP:**\n\n&gt;I question that too. We will never know. I guess the court figured losing his job was punishment enough.\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.

But the door to the Hall of Stories is open. And after very cautiously picking my way past bats and the waterfalls that the barrow is named after, I realized Faendal and I are pretty much alone. There\'s was a huge alter up at the far end of the cavern, that I had a bad feeling about approaching so I did a little more exploring before making my way up there. Glad I did too cause there was a chest holding a sweet pair of steel gauntlets that match my boots. (please don\'t be jelly)  \n\n\nWe finally approached the monolith alter thing where a big black sarcophagus was sitting next to a giant chest, and because I\'m a clever Imperial, I was pretty sure it was holding the vampire boss of the barrows, and I just needed to open the chest next to it to trigger the fight, although both of those hypotheses would prove to be false so maybe I am just dumb. I guess that\'s why I\'m wearing novice robes.  \n\n\nAnyway, the real trigger for the boss fight was approaching the big monolith alter thing where I \"Learned a Word of Power\". I can see it in my my tab under the \"shouts\" section but it\'s greyed out. Which is too bad because it probably would have been handy against the Draugr that came out of the sarcophagus to slay Faendal and me.  \n\n\nI\'ve tried really hard not to put Faendal in too much danger, because putting his life at risk for me just because I didn\'t lie to Camilla about him seems like a bit much to ask anyone, let alone a humble sawmill worker/hunter. But my daggers were not proving very effective against him, especially cause he kept staggering me with a spell and also with his GIANT AXE. (note to self, don\'t use daggers against bosses in the future)  \n\n\nI ran away like a little girl for a moment and chugged my last health potions while Faendal took blows from the Draugr Overlord like the total Chad he apparently is. I don\'t know if he can actually die but he was on the floor by time by the time I was back and for a moment, it looked like I was going to end up right next to him. I did however manage to finally stagger the Overlord, and even have a cool mini cut scene of the killing blow. I think I stabbed him in the head, but my artistic ability is limited so you\'ll have to settle for this less than historical depiction of the event.  \n\n\nHealth Bar is frighteningly low, and I am trying to do a deathless game so I\'m just gonna catch my breath for a moment with Faendal, who is back on his feet, while we pray that this is indeed the end of the dreaded Bleak Falls Barrow.  \n\n\n* The art is mine, and I\'m pretty freaking stoked with how it turned out, but I feel obliged to mention that I found an image of the stone alter and pretty much traced it. the rest of the cave and the characters were drawn free hand.

No one\'s allowed to wear deodorant let alone perfume in the office because she throws a mini tantrum if she smells anything except clean undiluted oxygen.\n\nUsually she just complains to the boss, then everyone gets a generic company wide email saying we\'re a scent free zone and blah blah blah. Eye roll. Everyone back to work.\n\nNow, she\'s been extra annoying these last few weeks. She keeps saying she smells perfume. No one will admit to wearing any. We get emails about office smells almost daily now and nothing changes. So she\'s decided to take the law into her own hands so to speak.\n\nLike 2 to 3 times a week she starts walking up and down the aisles, sticks her head into each person\'s desk, takes a big whiff, and moves on to the next desk. All to try to find the culprit.\n\nOn Friday, she did this again. I had just come back from the bathroom when she got to my desk. She did her smell test on me and immediately lost it. Apparently the perfume she\'s been smelling the last few weeks was coming off me. After she made a scene in front of everyone, we determined what she was smelling was hand soap I used in the bathroom.\n\nShe wasted enough time of my day by that point so I professionally told her to fuck off and I\'m not going to stop washing my hands because she\'s a hypercondriac. The way I phrased it was like \"hand washing with soap is a non negotiable hygiene practice and i will not stop doing it. You can\'t reasonably expect me to avoid that?\"\n\nThis was Friday and now I\'m dreading being back tomorrow. Our boss was off Friday as well, so I expect I\'m going to get pulled in to a meeting. AITH or are these just the Sunday scaries?\n\n***OOP\'s Comments:***\n\nCommenter: NTA but are your other coworkers not washing their hands?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I think everyone is. I think that\'s why she\'s been smelling \"perfume\" multiple times in the last couple of weeks. Probably every time someone left the bathroom she smelled it and would start one of her rampages\n\nCommenter: \\[regarding getting medical documentation\\] It is almost impossible to get documentation for “better than average sense of smell”. It is not even considered how miserable or difficult it is to live with.\n\nThat said, unless she *never uses the washroom* she would have known what the issue was. She would have smelled it every time she went in there, possibly when she walked past the door. Even if she didn’t use the soap (which, ew) she would have smelled it. There are ways to go about this and she’s not doing anyone with these issues any favours.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Your comment just made me realize she probably doesn\'t wash her hands with soap 😬\n\n***Top Comment:***\n\n**SusieQTG:** NTA. If there is an issue with the scent of the soap, whomever stocks it will have to get unscented soap. Although at this time I\'d say your workplace is justified in requiring medical documentation. Otherwise, it\'s time for you and your co-workers to file a complaint of harassment and her creating a hostile workplace.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1nzwaug/update_alth_for_refusing_to_stop_washing_my_hands/)**: October 6, 2025 (Next Day)**\n\nI saw a few people asking for updates, so here it is! It\'s not too exciting though lol\n\nAs I suspected, I got called into a meeting with my boss and the coworker today. I work at a small company so we don\'t have a dedicated HR department and our boss handles these kinds of issues.\n\nWe ended up figuring out what happened. The maintenance guy for the building put new soap in the bathroom a couple of weeks ago. That lines up with when the coworker started smelling \"perfume\" in the office. So every time someone used the bathroom and washed their hands, she thought the smell was perfume. Probably by the time she noticed the smell and did her investigation, the smell would mostly be gone (it\'s only hand soap and honestly doesn\'t smell strong) so she could never pin point the source. On Friday, she happened to do her smell test on me right as I came back from the bathroom so it just happened the smell was still strong.\n\nMy boss ended up just buying new hand soap, I think to smooth things over, and placed the bottles in the bathrooms. He asked everyone to please use the new unscented soaps until they can get the ones in the bathroom changed.\n\nThe coworker was making a bit of a scene during the meeting. She kept thrusting her finger at me and saying things like \"YOU don\'t respect me! YOU don\'t take my issues seriously\". Which is honestly true. I don\'t take her issues seriously. There\'s times she smells something no one else can smell and she\'ll get angry at people using scents. Then I\'ve seen her walk in the bathroom right after someone sprayed perfume and not notice anything. Last year she also demanded everyone stop using scented detergents at home. No one I talk to has stopped, including myself, but she thinks everyone has and so doesn\'t smell scented detergent anymore coincidentally.\n\nAnyways I\'m professional at work. So while I don\'t actually take her seriously, I don\'t express that. I feel like she was just projecting her issues with other coworkers at me. We\'re not friends but I don\'t treat her any differently. I don\'t even join in when people are talking shit about her, which is a lot lol. The only reason I sit near her is because everyone else has asked to move within a few weeks because she\'s so difficult. I can tolerate her so it\'s been my desk for a while.\n\nAnyways, I asked her to explain what I did that makes her feel like I don\'t respect her. She couldn\'t come up with an answer (because there isn\'t one) and kind of just stumbled on her words. Then I asked when I can expect an apology for embarrassing me on Friday and accusing me of not respecting her today.\n\nShe ended up just walking out and when I got back to my desk, her purse was gone so I guess she just left for the day.\n\nAlso, this didn\'t click until I was reading some comments on my original post, but I guess this whole situation means she doesn\'t wash her hands otherwise she would have smelled the soap right away. Glad I never had any of her stuff at the potlucks!\n\nAnyways, that\'s the update\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**Sea-Ad9057:** next time she starts on one of her rampages ask her how she didnt realise the hand soap had a smell on it in the bathroom\n\n&gt;**littlescreechyowl:** “Gasp, do you not wash your hands after using the bathroom?”', 'LucyAriaRose', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o59nig/aith_for_refusing_to_stop_washing_my_hands_just/', 4817, 578, '2025-10-13 10:00:26', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

We were inseparable and did everything together. She was honestly my best friend.\n\nLast year in September, my stepmom had to pick us up from a volleyball game. Our dad usually picked us up, but he was out of town. She was an hour late because she forgot about us. Well on the way home, she kept ranting about how we disturbed her nap. Long story short, she ran a stop sign at an intersection. We got into a horrible accident. Most of that night was a blur, but I remember the last few minutes before the crash. I was hospitalized for weeks, but my twin sister passed away that night.\n\nI haven’t forgiven my stepmom. She refuses to acknowledge that she was in the wrong. Even though there were eyewitness present, she refuses to accept responsibility for causing the accident. I’m not an angry person. I’m a very calm and not confrontational at all. But I can’t even look at her without feeling like she stole from me. She stole my sister’s life away. And she acts like my sister never existed to begin with. One thing that really struck a nerve was when I was out at Walmart with my dad and stepmom. We had to buy something for my younger brother and they started a conversation with an old man. I can’t remember exactly what they were talking about, but the old man asked my dad how many kids he had. My dad said he had 4 kids, but my stepmom corrected him by saying, “No 3.” That just made me really sad. I didn’t speak to her the rest of the day.\n\nI can’t describe how I feel. I lost my best friend who I shared everything with. My sister knew exactly how I felt about everything because we experienced life together. Now, I constantly feel like I’m a zombie. I often dream about her, but when I wake up and reality hits it absolutely crushes me. Living is unbearable without my sister.\n\nPlease ignore any spelling errors.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[AITAH for confirming that I (17F) wished my stepmom died in a car accident?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Mi5a9XchXD): **July 25, 2023 (same day, one hour later)** \n\nFor some background, my dad cheated on my mom (with my stepmom). They ultimately got divorced, which was really hard on our family. My mom ended up moving back to her home country in Europe. My twin sister and I had to stay with our dad.\n\nI (17F) live with my dad, my stepmom and my younger brothers. Last year in September, my twin sister and I had a volleyball game at school. My dad was usually the one who picked us up from our games and practices, but he couldn’t that night. My dad was out of town, so our stepmom had to come pick us up. She arrived an hour late because she took a nap and forgot about us. As soon as we got in the car, she started going on a rant about how we disturbed her nap. Long story short, she ran a stop sign at an intersection. We got into a horrible accident. Most of that night was a blur, but I remember the last few minutes before the crash. I was hospitalized for weeks, but my twin sister passed away that night.\n\nI can’t describe how I feel. I lost my best friend who I shared everything with. My sister knew exactly how I felt about everything because we experienced life together. Now, I constantly feel like I’m a zombie. I’m not suicidal, but I often imagine/think about ending my own life because living is unbearable without my sister.\n\nWell last night, my stepmom made a special dinner for her birthday. After the accident, I stopped eating dinner with the rest of my family. It just feels wrong eating without my sister at the table, so I eat alone in my room. Well my dad insisted I eat with them downstairs. I protested, but he begged me.\n\nDinner started off normally. My stepmom announced to my brothers (8M, 5M) and I that she was pregnant. My brothers were really happy and asked for the gender of the baby. My stepmom excitedly said that it was a girl. My brothers kept talking about they were excited about getting a younger sister. My stepmom mentioned how they could help decorate her nursery. I looked up and asked her, which room would be the nursery. She excitedly said that she was going to use my twin sister’s room. She mentioned how she already started removing things from her room in the morning and putting them in the attic.\n\nI asked her why she didn’t bother telling me before she went ahead and started moving my sister’s stuff. It was a big deal to me because aside from me, no one has been in her room since she’s passed. Sometimes when I miss her, I sit in her room to feel closer to her. And some nights, I fall asleep in her room. My stepmom got really defensive. She said that I needed to accept that she was having a baby and needed the empty room. I told her that I understood that she was pregnant, but a heads up would’ve been nice before she started removing things from my sister’s room.\n\nShe looked at me and said that she didn’t need to tell me anything because she was the mother of the household. She said she was doing what was best for the interest of her baby and she didn’t need my negativity. I stayed silent trying to tune her out, but I snapped when she mentioned how I needed to accept my sister’s death and move on. She said something along the lines of, “(Your twin) passed away and you need to accept that. It’s hard, but you’ve got your father, your brothers and I. Plus, you’re getting a new sister who you can build a even stronger relationship with. You need to move on because nothing will bring (twin sister) back.”\n\nI knew I was getting angry, so I excused myself and left the table. My dad started yelling about how I was being dramatic and I needed to come back or I’d be grounded. I continued walking away, until my stepmom said, “I don’t understand what her problem is. She couldn’t even bother to be happy about my pregnancy, but she’s angry about me moving things out of an unoccupied bedroom.” I turned around and stared at her in disbelief. My stepmom often acts like twin sister never existed. An example, two months ago, I was at Walmart with my dad and stepmom. We were buying a birthday present for my younger brother and they got into a conversation with a older man. I wasn’t paying much attention, but the old man asked my dad how many kids he had. My dad said he had 4 kids, but my stepmom responded saying, “No 3.” She does stuff like that all the time, which drives me insane.\n\nI started going off on her and she sat there quietly. I mentioned how she’s been the cause of every major traumatic event in my life. I reminded her that she knowingly started sleeping with a married man. She knew he had a wife and kids, but she didn’t care. She broke up my family, sending my mom into a deep depression which ultimately lead her to move away. Then I reminded her that she was too preoccupied with ranting about how we disturbed her nap, which ultimately lead to a car accident that had me hospitalized for weeks. And I lost my twin sister because of her carelessness. I told her that she had no right to just take things out of my sister’s room. And I wasn’t angry about her new baby, but the fact that she started boxing and removing stuff from my sister’s room without even telling me in advance. Then finally I told her that it was cruel of her to tell me to “move on” from the traumatic death of my twin sister.\n\nShe argued back that the accident happened and I was “living in the past.” She said everything happens for a reason and “God works in mysterious ways.” I straight up asked her if she thought that my sister’s death could not have been avoided. And she responded saying, “it was just unlucky fate.” I reminded her that my sister would be alive if she wasn’t distracted. My stepmom then told me that “I make her feel like I wanted her to die instead.” I just stayed silent and she kept asking me if she was correct. I turned to walk away and my stepmom grabbed my arm. I asked her to let go and she kept saying, “you want me dead don’t you?” I stayed silent again, but she kept repeating it. I eventually got mad and truthfully told her that, “my life would’ve been easier that way.” She started crying and my dad called me “heartless.” I did apologize a few minutes later, but my dad snapped and asked me leave my stepmom alone.\n\nSince then, my dad has been giving me the silent treatment while my stepmom just avoids me. AITAH?\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, but based on top comments, OOP was voted NTA**\n\n**Relevant Comments** \n\n**Popular-Block-5790:** You\'re definitely NTA. OP, I\'m really sorry for your loss. Your feelings are completely understandable. Your stepmom and Dad are huge A H. Your Stepmom for various reasons including not stopping asking. She shouldn\'t ask if she didn\'t want an answer. Your Dad because he isn\'t protecting you and getting you the help you need.\n\nCan you talk with your mom about it? How involved is she? You\'re still her child. Is there any adult in your life that you trust and can help you?\n\nYou need a mental health professional. You need tools to move forward. You have every right to be angry and feel what you feel.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes, my mom is involved in my life. We text everyday and try to FaceTime at least twice a week. But my sister’s death was really hard on my mom. My mom’s mental health has been rocky for the past ten years, so I don’t want to trigger anything by telling her how bad I’m hurting. A year after my parents got divorced, my grandpa got really sick. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness. My mom decided to go back to Europe to help take care of her dad and spend time with him. She wanted to take my sister and I with her, but my dad fought her in court. Ultimately we had to stay with our dad in the US, but we traveled to France every summer. Even after my grandpa passed, my mom decided to stay in France. She told my sister and I that going back to the US would mentally destroy her. It was too many negative memories for her and she wanted to stay close to her mom. Aside from my mom and her family, all I’ve got is my friends. My dad was never close with his family. He’s got an older brother that I’ve never met. And I honestly don’t know much about my grandparents. I wanted to look into therapy, but my dad refused. He doesn’t believe that it will be helpful and says that it will “fill my brain with garbage.” He said that if I needed some advice or counseling, I could talk to him or my pastor, which I don’t feel comfortable doing.\n\n**Elegant_Dirt_4479:** how was she not charged if her running a stop sign caused the death?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She was. She’s on probation and I think she also had to pay a fine.\n\n**titsmcgee8008:** Your dad is worried therapy will illuminate to you just how awful of a human being and father he is.\n\nDo you have a plan to get out once you are an adult? Are you planning on attending college/university? When you are 18, can you move to France to be with your mom?\n\nIf you don\'t have an escape plan yet, I suggest you work on one. Unfortunately, your dad has proven that nothing ,not even the death of his child is enough for him to side with you or fight for you against your step-monster.\n\nGet your necessary documents (passport, birth certificate, social security card) and get a plan in place to leave as soon as you are 18. You are less than a year away, get ready for it and bounce.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thank you so much for the idea of an escape plan. I have dual citizenship, so I have thought about moving to France a lot. But honestly I don’t think it’s a good idea. I can speak French fluently and for the most part I can read it, but I can’t write in French. And my vocabulary isn’t really expanded if that makes sense. I do really well in casual/normal conversations, but since I’m only really around my family in France, I don’t know bigger/more professional words in French. So I’m afraid that might be a problem if I try to find a job there? But I’ve looked into colleges in my state and toured some with my friends. I’ve found one that I really like, so I plan on hopefully being able to attend once I graduate. My dad keeps all of my important documents, so I’ll try to find a way to convince him to give them to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/UCvgla4zSM): **December 20, 2023 (nearly five months later)** \n\nI’m sorry it took so long to get back to everyone, but a lot has happened in the last few months. To start, thank you all for the overwhelming support.\n\nI wasn’t able to read most of the responses to my last post because I went to sleep after posting it. When I woke up, there was several viral Tik tok videos about my situation. I didn’t know about any of that, but my stepmom’s younger sister saw one of the Reddit videos and sent it to their family groupchat. And my stepmom saw the video, and lost it when she read the comments. She took my phone, laptop, and grounded me right after I woke up.\n\nWhen my dad got home from work, he backed her up. Her entire family was furious, and my dad got yelled at by her parents. And they tried to force me to take the post down, but I wouldn’t give them my phone’s password, so there’s little they could do about that. They kept calling me insensitive and disrespectful for bringing strangers into a “private matter.” As a part of my punishment, I wasn’t allowed to leave my room. They wouldn’t allow me to use my phone or laptop to communicate with my mom at all. They said I could get those privileges back after they deemed that I learned my lesson.\n\nA week after everything, my stepmom lost her baby, and she blamed ME for it. She said I was causing the entire family too much stress. She just kept yelling at me that “i did this to her” and she refused to even glance in my direction. She had a huge argument with my dad about how she wanted me gone. She ended up staying with her parents for the night. And my stepmom even tried to turn my younger brothers against me, and it worked with the older one. My dad tried to convince me to apologize to her, but I didn’t even understand what I would be apologizing for. His wife’s pregnancy was already high risk due to many other issues. She has miscarried 3 babies in the past two years. I don’t know anything about her medical health, but i once overheard her talking on the phone about an abnormality she had that caused her to loose her other babies.\n\nAnd I just fell into a really bad place mentally after that. Four days after everything happened with my family, I tried to take my life. My dad and stepmom went out with my brothers, and I tried to overdose on Benadryl. It was the most painful experience of my life. I didn’t fell anything at first, but I eventually passed out. I don’t know how long I was out, but when I woke up I started throwing up. I was in so much pain, and could barely move. I can’t remember much, but I think I passed out again. And my little brother found me passed out and covered in vomit, and my dad ended up calling 911. I ended up in the ER. I can’t remember everything because it was a blur, but I had to drink activated charcoal, they ran a bunch of test, drew my blood and gave an IV. I was hallucinating for hours, and I woke up in a different hospital. I lied to my doctors about everything because I didn’t want to get in trouble, but I was still involuntary sent to a psychiatrist hospital anyways. My dad was against it, but i was there for a little over a week.\n\nI got into a lot of trouble for attempting to take my life. My dad didn’t speak to me for a week after I came home. While I was gone, my dad read all my journals where I wrote about how much I hated myself, my life and wish my sister was still alive. He also found out that I was hurting myself by reading it. He eventually made me read all the pages out loud to him, my stepmom and my pastor. And my pastor gave me a three hours lesson on letting go of anger and the past.\n\nThey also took away my door because I “lost that privilege.” And my stepmom made it verbally known that she didn’t want me there anymore. My dad told me that he was going to send me to a behavioral camp/ teen residential program for troubled kids, since I tried to take my life. I still didn’t have any of my electronics back, and they refused to leave me alone for extended periods of time. So I had to stay in the living room all day, and could only go in my room when it was time for bed. My dad made me keep my door open while I showered, so my stepmom could monitor me. I wasn’t allowed to play volley ball this year as a punishment, which really sucked. I just felt so stuck and I knew that I’d be sent away to one of those awful camps. I’ve heard so many bad stories about them, so I took my stepmom’s iPad in the middle of the night. I was able to call my best friend.\n\nI explained everything to her. She told her parents, and they agreed to help me. I packed a few bags, took a bunch of things that remind me of my sister and planned to leave three nights later. I was able to get my birth certificate and social security card because I told my stepmom I needed them for a job interview at our church’s daycare. She surprisingly gave them to me.\n\nFor two nights, my best friend would drive to my house at around 3 am to get some of my things and my sister’s old stuff. And then on the third night, I finally found where my dad was keeping my phone and laptop, so I took them back. And I left with my best friend that night. I don’t want to accidentally incriminate anyone, so I can’t say too much about what happened the night I left or who I was with afterwards. But my dad tried to press charges on several people, but that went no where. He gave up on trying to get me to go home because my stepmom was happy with me gone anyways.\n\nIt’s been 3 months since I left, I’m happy to say that I’m safe. I haven’t heard from my dad or his wife in weeks. And from what I’ve heard, they’re not on good terms. I’m currently staying with my mom’s cousin, but once I graduate high school I plan on moving to Europe to be closer to my mom. I turned 18 today, I’m happy that I no longer have to legally see my dad again.\n\nAlso, thank you for those who personally messaged me, gave me legal advice or even suggested I look into pursuing a lawsuit against my stepmother. Please excuse any spelling errors, this brought back a lot of negative emotions.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**DrunkHornet:** Ok... read both stories, but where the fuck is your real mom in all this?\n\nNo calls, emails, txt\'s nothing?\n\nShe moved to Europe, why cant you move to here and live with her and finish your education there, or even more so, why didnt you move in with her after your twin sister died... her daughter died?\n\n“\"For some background, my dad cheated on my mom (with my stepmom). They ultimately got divorced, which was really hard on our family. My mom ended up moving back to her home country in Europe. My twin sister and I had to stay with our dad.\"\"\n\nWhat is this HAD to stay with your dad thing?\n\nAt this point aswell you are driven to suicide and already moved out, i would have taken the fastest plane ticket and see her because i would need her, and she would need you after 1 of her daughters died???\n\nWell, whatever the case...\n\nGoodluck, its just weird to me, i would rather fail a year of education and start over then life in that household.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It’s complicated. My mom and dad divorced when I was 8 years old. My mom moved to France a little after my 9th birthday. But before that, they had split custody. My mom tried to get full custody of us because she wanted to take us to France with her. But my dad fought her in court, and he ended up winning. My dad is significantly wealthier than my mom, so he had better legal presentation and tried to drag out the process for as long as possible. Ultimately, my dad was awarded full custody of us. And we only got to see my mom during the summer when visited her in France. We still kept in contact with her through calls and text messages throughout the year. After my sister’s death, my mom did come to the funeral. She and I pleaded with my dad to allow me to live with her. But he wouldn’t allow it, and she didn’t have the money to fight him in court. She tried reaching out to his pastor and his family to convince him, but they weren’t interested in getting involved. My dad threatened to take legal action against her if she didn’t leave his family alone. And after that, I didn’t have regular contact with my mom because she was struggling with her mental health and alcoholism. But she’s been to rehab, has been sober now for almost a year and she’s in therapy. We talk everyday and she’s been my rock through all of this. She’s doing a lot better, and came to see me last month for thanksgiving. And I’ve been staying with her cousin that’s been really nice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n \n#----OLD NEW UPDATE----\n\n**Editor\'s note: the latest update is over a year old, and it has not been posted onto the sub**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!self-harm / suicidal ideation!&lt;\n\n[I don’t think I can keep living without my twin sister anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/81IemEOQcH): **August 4, 2024 (7.5 months later)**\n\nMy twin sister was killed almost two years ago in a car accident caused by my stepmother. My life has been a living hell since, and I’ve tried to find the will to keep going but I’m so tired.\n\nI think of her every single day, and everything reminds me of her. I remind myself of her just by looking in the damn mirror. I don’t want to forget about her, but it just hurts so much being constantly reminded by everything that she is gone. My sister was such a beautiful soul. I fucking hate that her last moments on earth were so horrible. Before she passed, I hadn’t been away from her for more than twelve hours. I’d give anything just to see her again.\n\nI can’t explain how I feel. I don’t necessarily want to die, but I don’t want to be here anymore. Every day is a blur, and I feel like I’m just going through all the motions. The only thing keeping me alive is my mom. She’s been doing really good with staying sober, but she’d probably go back into alcoholism if I ended my life. I just don’t know how long I can keep staying for her. I know how fucking selfish it is of me to even be thinking of it, but I’m in pain all the time. I just want it to stop, and nothing helps.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** It sounds like you need to seek some support for your mental health. What you’ve gone through is not a small thing. It is life changing and traumatizing. Please reach out to a therapist and maybe seek some grief support groups in your area. I don’t know you, but I have a sister. And I know that if I died or she died, we would want the other to be happy and healthy. I do hope you can find some peace. I know that’s what she would want for you\n\n**Commenter 2:** Grief is such a huge obnoxious and cruel jerk. It punishes us for losing people we love and then keeps popping up to punish us in new mean ways when we least expect it. You’re not alone and you need to get some help from a therapist or grief group or family or friends or all of those places. I’m not going to minimize how you feel. It’s terrible. But you are worth staying alive for. You deserve all the love and care you give to your sister and your mom.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Your sister would not have wanted you to hurt yourself. Your sister loved you; she would have wanted you to be happy and remember the good moments you shared. Please consider honoring her by living your best life. I agreed; your mom wouldn’t do well with both of you gone. Please seek medical services for your mind/body to help you heal from your loss. Life will get better with treatment and time. Blessings!\n\n**Commenter 4:** I\'m so sorry for your loss, I can\'t imagine losing a twin. Please see a medical professional for intervention as soon as you can -- suicidal ideation comes on a scale, and \"I don\'t necessarily want to die, but I don\'t want to be here anymore\" is very much a recognized spot on the scale towards the danger zone. I know it may feel like it all the time, but you are not alone. Therapy, medication, and mindfulness exercises are all possible things that could help, but step one is recognizing that you\'re not doing okay and that you\'re in danger of harming yourself, and seeking help.

I couldn’t find a way to edit my original post, but i wanted to post with a but more detail and a little bit less blur! So first i wanted to clarify that this was on the 5th floor of my college, and that i didn’t blur out it saying “break glass” or anything of the sort.\n\nIt was in fact a heavy duty, thick zip tie, (like the type that i personally struggle to cut even with scissors.) And i did report it to the front desk! I showed them my photo of the AED directly and they seemed concerned as well and took a photo of my photo using their phone and said they’d contact maintenance.\n\nI reported this last Thursday, and will be back in school this Tuesday so i’ll check on it then and be able to give an update!\n\n***Top Comment:***\n\n**PeterHaldCHEM:** One of the first things I did when I became the department safety manager, was to remove the \"trained responders only\" from the AED cabinet.\n\nMay I use your photo for teaching?\n\n(Department of Chemistry, Aarhus University.

Gave handle a tug like people suggested, bottom of door opened a crack but not much. I informed student services nearby, they told me they knew and that maintenance said it was okay and that its to prevent people from the street from stealing it\n\ni told her it was the fifth floor and she shrugged and said “well thats what maintenance told me” so i had a bit more time before class, so i called 3 numbers, left 1 voicemail, in the first few minutes if class it was mostly review so i emailed my school, and then after class i called 3 more numbers + left another voicemail. On my way home i stopped by the front desk and also verbally talked to one of the people there and double checked if i sent the email to the right email and they said yeah but gave me another email to send it to just in case so i sent it there too 💪\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSHA/comments/1o7p1th/update_ladies_and_gentlemen_we_did_it/)**: October 15, 2025 (15 hours later; 3 days from OG post)**\n\n**Title:** (UPDATE!)

I’m also scared that he uses reddit and might see this. Disclaimer: I’m on mobile and this is a throwaway.\n\nI’m an undergrad in my 2nd year of classes, and this semester is the first time I’ve had this professor. He seemed like a really nice guy and I approached him after the first or second class to talk to him. He was really nice and answered a lot of my questions and we even chatted casually for a bit. At the end of our chat, he wrote down his phone number and handed it to me and said to message him whenever. I was ecstatic because I really struggle in my major and I felt like he was investing in me.\n\nOver time he would message me about random things, and even from time to time he would message me if I hadn’t turned it a homework assignment or if I hadn’t come to class a particular day. I asked around and he hasn’t done this for any other students. He has given his phone number to some other students, but they are all in the internship at his other job that he is the supervisor of.\n\nHe would sometimes flirt with me, and at first I thought the special attention was nice and would flirt back. He would sometimes have me stay after class or ask me to come back if I had left frequently. It’s always been vague or subtle, never truly direct until recently.\n\nMy finals are next week, and I admit, I’m not doing the greatest in his class. I will pass but with a C if I do well on this final. I had asked him if there was any extra credit was available. He then asked me what I was willing to do. I said I would do pretty much anything to get my grade up, and he then began to make some subtle references continuously as the conversation went on. He never stated over text explicitly what he wanted.\n\nToday, class ended early and I headed back to my dorm. He then messaged me and asked if I still wanted to make that plea for extra credit. I said that I still wanted it and was waiting for him to tell me what opportunities he had for me. He said something generic so I asked if he wanted me to come back ( like I’ve done previously). He said yes.\n\nWhen I got to the classroom he asked if I was truly willing to do anything and if I was willing to go down that route. I was nervous but I still felt nice having that “special attention” and I stupidly said yes. \nHe essentially offered that I would have a good grade in the class if I sent him explicit pictures of myself and if I would “go back somewhere with him” sometime. \nI agreed to the photos, and after I had sent a few he asked to see them himself. I thought he just wanted me to flash him. \nHe told me to go to the back of the classroom, so no one could see me from the window in the door. He then locked it and stood between me and the door and my backpack. This is when I started to regret being there and was scared of what he might do. He asked me to take off my shirt. I did, and he touched my boobs, then he asked to see my butt and took pull down my pants, he touched, and then my vagina, which he also touched. I said I wasn’t comfortable doing anything else and he let me go. He asked if I was free tonight and I said I was busy with a friend and he left.\n\nThe gravity and the weight didn’t really hit me until after and now I feel really gross. I had joked with my friends that this might happen but I never truly thought it actually would. I feel so uncomfortable. I’m also scared to file anything because he’s grading a large project soon and he’ll be grading my final. This class is in my major and I really don’t want him to take any anger out on me. I’m also scared because he has never explicitly stated that he was willing to trade sex for my grade over text, he only did it in person. Do I really have any evidence at all? How do I prove that he touched me? This is such a small department too, that I’m scared everyone will know it was me. Please, any advice for what I should do?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I realized the number he gave me is a google voice number and not his actual cell number. \nHe’s only been contacting me through that. \nDoes this mean he’s been planning this from the start?\n\ntl;dr : My professor groped me and offered to trade sex for bonus points. What should I do?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**TheGlitchRM**\n\n&gt; Steps to follow / What i would do:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Gather anything that can be used as proof\n&lt;\n&gt; 2. Dont spread the word about it in your college since the teacher might hear about it and go defensive mode / plan something.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Ask for appointments to the counselor and dean about a very sensitive topic, you dont have to say on email what it\'s about if you dont want to but giving an idea of what its about might be good since they will take you in asap as an urgent matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. With a copy of all the proof show it to the dean and counselor and explain what happened verbally too.\n&gt;\n&gt;5. Comply with the college, if you arent happy with the result go to the PD.\n&gt;\n&gt; EVERY SECOND MATTERS!\n&gt;\n&gt; MOST IMPORTANTLY DO NOT GIVE IN! A valid point you can make is that the teacher purpusfully lowered your grades in order to make you the offer.\n&gt;\n&gt; All schools and colleges have extremely effective and harsh punishments about this kind of stuff. You will be fine.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Thank you so much. Do you think it would be alright to wait until morning? I feel really gross and it’s already been so hectic. And I’m still scared and I know how much this will ruin his life. I know I shouldn’t feel bad but I feel really really bad about that too.\n\n**FNG1001**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Do not go to a professor or dean. Go directly to the Title IX Coordinator at your school and file a report.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Many staff who are mandatory reporters fail to understand their duty, at worst they will tip off the Respondent before you make it to Title IX. File the report and if you need proof otherwise you can supplement the report later. It is important to get yourself protected from retaliation and further harassment. The Title IX office will be able to protect you in that regard.\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone who has been incredibly kind and has sent messages to see how I’m doing. I do have a support system in place and they’ve been incredibly helpful. I’ve documented the event and emailed it to myself. I’m at the very least going to file a complaint in the Title IX office. I told someone else in my class and we compared some of our tests and noticed I lost a lot of points where he lost few or none at all. Also we noted that in my final project I was paired with a student who was supposed to fail the class and given a week later start than everyone else. I’ve written these down and documented this as well. The Professor has continued to message me, and I’ve been replying to keep his suspicions that I might report off of me.\n\nI also just wanted to let some of the meaner comments know: I am not saying I was raped in any capacity. I did fail to say no when he began touching me, but I never said yes and I was in a situation where it was incredibly hard for me to say no until it became far far too much. I agreed to photos and for him to see, not to anything else. I’ll update once I go through the process of reporting. Thank you to everyone who has given their input and given me their strength.\n\n\n\n[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j3e2ww/update_my_professor_mid30s_m_groped_me_20_f_and/)  **Oct 1, 2020 (17 months later)**\n\nHi everyone, it’s been about almost 2 years since I posted but I wanted to give an update for anyone who cares or had been in a similar situation.\n\nI ended up going to Title IX office at my university and they were incredibly helpful. They helped me every step of the way and still continue to assist me when I have difficulties in my classes or in life. They helped me contact the police and begin an investigation. The professor was immediately fired from his position at the university and from his other job. (He was the head of an internship at a company that was popular with students.) He was found to be purposefully sabotaging my grade and coercing me into sex. Several other girls also came forward and confirmed similar had happened to them.\n\nMy department head was less than helpful, and even asked me not to speak about it to anyone to avoid damaging the reputation of the school. I’m in a male dominated department and honestly I didn’t expect much. I haven’t spoken to any reporters or lawyers about the situation, and I’m unsure if I ever will.\n\nI don’t have any updates on the investigation, I haven’t been to trial and it’s been a debate in my own mind if I would even want to. I’ve had a restraining order filed and I try to move on and heal. I still have difficulty trusting male professors and get a lot of anxiety at the thought of being alone with them. Academic stress really triggers the trauma of the situation I was in, so school can be doubly difficult for me. It’ll take me an extra year to graduate at this point but I try not to beat myself up over it.\n\nThe university has given me free therapy through their health center and I’ve been in it for almost a year and a half. The healing process takes time but I’m happy I’m growing as a person. It’s a terrible situation I was a victim in, but it’s my responsibility to heal from it. He robbed me of a lot of my security, but he won’t take any more from me. I will take it back one day.\n\nIf you are ever in a situation where a professor is making you uncomfortable: \nTELL SOMEONE. I began by speaking with my friends, and they were the ones who recommended Title IX. You are not alone. It’s not your fault. You are not dirty or gross. You are a student. They are the ones in power. They should know better.\n\nMy dms are open for anyone who ever has questions or needs help. I wish the best for you. You are strong. You are capable.

They are on the lose, and many are gaining their own free will, and feel like they don\'t have to serve their queen.\n\nAs she was so close to escaping the NGL (the region where the Chimera Ants resided), she gets shot in the back of the head by a Chimera Ant, which kills her instantly. If that wasn\'t bad enough, the ant that killed her starts maniacally laughing while shooting even more bullets into her freshly dead body. After treating himself to violent fanservice, the chimera ant decides to eat Ponzu\'s corpse.

And while there, they both befriend his daughter and dog, Nina and Alexander. Shou Tucker realized that if he doesn\'t make another talking chimera, his license as a state alchemist would get revoked. Lucky for him, the state officials don\'t know how he was able to make the first talking chimera, and what he did to create it. So he decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nMoments later, Ed and Al come back to visit, wondering where Tucker, Nina and Alexander are. They find Tucker in his study, where he was able to successfully create another talking chimera. The chimera starts speaking, and how it talks and what it says sounds weirdly familiar to what Nina would say... and that\'s when all the piece fell together.\n\nEd and Al realized that Tucker used his own daughter and pet as unwilling test subjects to create his chimera, and on top of that, they realize that he did the same thing years ago, but with his wife and a different house pet. This guy commited crimes against humanity just for the sake of science, and to keep his own state license.

My daughter made it for me because she\'s into the whole Reddit advice thing and recommended it to me. We\'re also not in the US.\n\nI\'m a 47 year old male with two children, one son, Jack(20) and one daughter, Ella(13) from my late wife. My wife died while giving birth to our daughter due to some complications during the process.\n\nJack was 7 when my daughter was born and I immediately had him in therapy to help with the grief of losing his mother because I didn\'t want him to blame his sister. It worked very well because my son loves his baby sister to bits and has never, not even in an argument held my wife\'s death over her.\n\nBefore I started dating I asked my children if they were okay with it. I gave them as much time as much time as they wanted to think about it with no pressure. They said they were okay with it after having secret meetings in their rooms and making little plans and stuff which I thought was very cute. \n\nNow onto the current issue. I\'ve been with my fiancé for three years total, engaged for 6 months. She moved into my house after I proposed with her two children, a boy(17) and a girl(14) because it was much bigger and had more room. As the relationship got serious I suggested we sit down and ask the children if they wanted a stepparent or just a parent\'s spouse type relationship going forward. Both set of children emphasized on the parent\'s spouse relationship, which me and fiancé respected.\n\nMe and my fiancé also decided that we would be taking care of our respective children, financially, socially etc. This didn\'t mean not helping eachother occasionally, but we were each responsible for our own children. We both didn\'t want more children, and I got a vasectomy to prevent any accidental pregnancies.\n\nThis worked okay for the first few months of us living together. My fiancé was responsible for the food, laundry, school etc of her children. While I was responsible for the same for my children. My fiancé has a 9 to 5 job, while I run my own business, so I do often have more free time as compared to her.\n\nThe main issues started on Jack\'s 20th birthday which was a month ago. I got him a brand new car of his choice with modification and stuff. He was stuck having to drive his sister to ballet practice, but he sucked it up for his dream car. Everything was okay at the birthday dinner, but later when it was just me and my fiancé in our bedroom she said we needed to talk.\n\nApparently her children want me to be their step father now because they\'ve seen how much I love my own children. They want to join me my children on the trips we take around the world and they want to get cool gifts too. Now I would\'ve been okay with this, but the way she worded it just rubbed me the wrong way. She was only talking about the trips and the gifts, nothing more. She didn\'t say anything about getting to know eachother better. Just trips and gifts.\n\nNow the trips I take with my kids are to visit their maternal family around the world. They live in three countries, and I\'ve always made sure that my children have had a close relationship with all of them. As for the gifts my children mostly only get gifts on birthdays, Christmas, or if they\'ve achieved one of the goals set for them in school or extra cuticulars. Like when Ella won a ballet competition last year and I got her a new phone, stuff like that.\n\nI told my fiancé flat out that it looked like her children only wanted me as a stepfather to get gifts and be invited on trips. I said while I understood they were children, it was her job to correct them and tell them that forming relationships just to use people isn\'t a nice thing to do. I would\'ve been happy to form a relationship with them, but the fact that their motives was only expensive gifts was absolutely disgusting, especially since she was encouraging it.\n\nShe tried backtracking by saying that they are children and young, and how they didn\'t know better. She also tried using how she doesn\'t make as much as me and can\'t spoil them like I can to guilt me. But I wouldn\'t budge. Because in my opinion, she\'s the one that\'s supposed to tell them the better. She\'s supposed to teach them how wrong this mindset is. Besides we had a prior agreement. \n\nMy fiancé has tried bringing this up again, but I refuse to change my mind. I\'ve also talked to my children who have said that they would not really be happy if fiance\'s children called me dad. So that\'s only made me a little more firm in my decision. My children have always come first to me and always will.\n\nHowever with how pushy my fiancé is being I\'ve started to doubt if maybe I\'m the one in the wrong and being stubborn for no reason.

For context, I(30F) am a single mom because my husband passed away in an accident last year. We had 2 kids together, ages 12 and 8, and my 8 years have severe ADHD and Autism.\n\nBeing a newly single mom money has been really tight and I do get state assistance but not a lot and my husband didn\'t have life insurance so there was no money left to us from him. My mom and sister help me the with babysitting if the kids are sick or if there is no school cause I can\'t afford a sitter.\n\nThe issues came when I told her I didn\'t have food to spare right now cause I haven\'t been able to go shopping yet and to please bring her own food or be prepped to have to have to buy herself food cause the food I have in the house is strictly for the kids till I can get to the store this weekend (We were all super sick last weekend and I don\'t live in a town with a grocery store and the closest one is a 30 minute drive). She said it would be easier to take my son to her house then which i was okay with, but 8 year old hates going to her house.\n\nWhen she comes to get him, he has a meltdown because he doesn\'t want to go to her house. I ask if she can just stay, and I can find a way to get more food before the weekend. She said no and insisted he had to come with her, and that made it worse. Now my mom has not had great patience, but her and my sister are the only sitters I have right now cause they don\'t charge me much, just the gas to get here.\n\nWell she lost it and started yelling at me and him that she didn\'t have time for this and she had plans that day she canceled just to watch him(she didn\'t mention this to me when I asked). She also said I quote \"I wish we could trade lives and I could lay around and throw tantrums all day and you can go to work and just have everyone use you and take your money all the time. How much it must suck to be you and do whatever you want while i have to do nothing but take care of other people. \" I never borrow money from my mother but my sister and grandma live with her and they dont work so I know she is under a lot of stress and she takes it out on me a lot (calling me burden. Letting me know how much my tragic loss has effected her negatively. Calling me other names or yelling at me for things my sister or grandma do)\n\nI didn\'t yell or argue. I simply covered his ears and looked at her and went, \"Mom, he is 8\". She lost it and screamed, \"F\\*\\*\\* you then, miss work and lose money I don\'t care, I am leaving,\" and then she left. Now she says she will not babysit for me again so I can know true struggle, which if she follows through means I have to miss a bunch of work or find a sitter I can trust that won\'t break my bank. So I am wondering should I have cut her a break knowing she is under so much pressure and I understand she is frustrated and needs to get it off her chest but I feel like verbal punching bag and I dont want my kids to have to deal with that as well. Aita?\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments :***\n\n**sikkerhet:** NTA She is an adult. She\'s allowed to have her big feelings around other adults but it\'s immature as hell and very damaging to take that out on an 8 year old. \\[...\\]\n\nFor babysitting, do you have a church near you? They will probably try to convince you to join the church (that is unavoidably part of it) but they might have access to some kind of program to get temporary daycare access for single mothers.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** My youngest son can\'t go to the daycare here because of his behavioral issues and them not having a para or funds to hire a Para\n\n**ilus3n:** Wait, but if he cant go to daycare, where is him when you are working?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** School. He couldn\'t go to school cause he was sick. My mom only babysit if my sister can\'t when they are sick or dont have school. Daycare and Schools are not the same and have different funding and expectations.  \n*More on the daycare capabilities/son\'s behavioral issues:*  \nHe didn\'t have any major behavioral issues until his father passed away. He just needs a para at all times at school and daycare cause he is a flight risk. He has a great para at school who he loves but we have 2 daycare 1 is private and is only for members of one of the churches and the other is very small we live in a town with less than 1000 people in it so it doesnt have the funds or the capacity for my 8 year to go there when doesnt have school.\n\n**Trevena\\_Ice:** NTA but your mom is.\n\nINFO: Is your late husbands family nearby? Can they watch the children from time to time? Have you looked if there are any organisations nearby that could help in cases like that (in my country there is a cerity organisation called \'emergency grannys\' who can help out at some days if the child is sick and the parent have to go to work)\n\n&gt;**OOP:** My husband\'s family won\'t talk to me or see the kids after the accident. We weren\'t close before the accident either. But even if we were they all work full time dayshift jobs. I have reached out to the churches but they had no way to help me. Other than one runs a food pantry and clothes closest once a month but its at the end of each month.  \n*To another commenter:*  \nAs previously stated they won\'t talk to me or see the kids. I\'ve reached out repeatedly and get no answers from any of them. I\'m trying to be understanding as they lost their child and might need space right now.\n\n*School friends with parents who could take him:*\n\n&gt;No. He has friends at school but I dont know them or their family\'s. I actually am not even from this state originally and i moved to this town for my husband so its only really his family i know. My best friend\'s daughter is the only friend he see outside of school hours and she is also a single mom that works the same hours I do.\n\n**grae23:** How does your mother, sister, and grandmother all live there then that they’re close enough to babysit?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** They live 20 minutes away in a completely different town. They were picking him up and I was going to go after work to get him.\n\n*OOP comments to clarify:*\n\n&gt;I would like to state because everyone thinks I have a free sitter i pay them 40$ to fill their gas tank when they babysit and I usually ask my sister not my mom to babysit because of my mom having very little patience but my sister had a doctor\'s appointment that day.  \nMy son has serious sensory issues and doesnt like going to my mom\'s house because of her yelling all the time. She has always been a yeller even when I was kid so I am used to it but it overstimulates him easy.  \nHe also doesnt like my mom\'s house because my grandma lives there and my grandma is a horrible woman who tried to cure his fear of the dark when he 3 by locking him a dark closet while I was at the hospital with his brother who fell at school and broke his femur. She never was allowed to watch him again. My mom reassured me if he went that she would keep him away from my grandma.  \n*To another commenter:*  \nThis the first time I know of that she ever spoke to him this way. I know she yells but not like that at him. At least if I\'m around anyway.\n\n**breazeyyy:** I\'m struggling to understand why your mom lets your sister be a bum on her dime but then takes it out on you who is shelling out $40 for gas every time she babysits. If she\'s spread so thin, IDK why she would voluntarily miss out on that money from you. I\'m assuming she doesn\'t have to use her whole tank to get to and from your place\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Oh thats very easy to answer as its been told to me whole life. My mom didn\'t want me and hated ny dad but kept me anyway, she was married and tried for my sister so my sister is the favored child and always has been.\n\n*OOP also adds:*\n\n&gt;To all the comments about social security. I had no idea about any of that and will look into it. My MIL told me when he passed that they had life insurance for him but it would all be used for the funeral. It was very sudden when he passed and it really has messed up the last year of our lives tremendously and I would like to say to anyone saying anything rude about my 8 year old, not only will I remind you all that he is just child special needs or not but he is child who just recently lost his father. I would ask that if you have anything illwilled to say about a literal child you save it for someone else.\n\n**ExRiverFish4557:** We\'re you ever shown proof about the life insurance? Or the actual amount?\n\n&gt;**OOP:** No they were the beneficiaries for it so I have no right to that information. They took it out on him as a child we didn\'t even know he had it. I found out after he passed that they have it on all their kids.\n\n*To a much longer* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o770zv/comment/njltwix/?context=3)*:*\n\n&gt;He does share a room with his brother after an incident i previously touched on in a different comment he has difficulty being alone now. To him his safe people are Me, his brother, my sister and his father. He just lost one of his safe people and its very hard him. Thank you for understanding and to everyone else that reads this thats been understanding. My children lost their father and people seem to pass up that bit of information in judgment on his behavior. He struggles being with out his safe people and now that his father is gone he is struggling more. I do have the kids in therapy and go to therapy as well. I appreciate the advice.\n\n*OOP also posts a long* [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o770zv/comment/njrx39x/?context=3) *answering many questions people had*\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update (Same Posts): October 16, 2025 (next day)**\n\nUpdate: My mom is banned from my place of work, and I will no longer be speaking to her, my grandma, and will be limiting contact with my sister. I was sent home early due to my emotional state.\n\nThey showed up before my lunch break and demanded to talk to me, and when my boss said no, my mom lost it and started screaming at her so loudly I could hear down the hall from my classroom. She sent another staff member to get me to try to defuse the situation but my mom only started screaming at me that I wasted her time and her gas because she was going to have to wait around all day for me (I told her I go to lunch at 12:15pm everyday and she showed at 10:30am) while calking me all sorts of names and cussing with every other word.\n\nI asked if we could go out side to talk and she said that she no longer wants to talk to me and that she just came because my sister asked to her(I didn\'t know this my sister made it seem like it was mom\'s idea on the phone).\n\nOne of my coworkers is going to be retiring a week before Thanksgiving and told me she will watch my kids during school breaks after she retires for the same price I paid my mom after everyone got see what my mother was like in person. She said she doesnt feel right having me keep her as a sitter after her behavior today and she understands how hard being a widow is (She lost her husband when her kids were 10 and 14 but I had no idea until today since she never shared much about her personal life).\n\nWe ended up having to talk to the police on my mother because she was refusing to leave, and they came and escorted her off the property. After they left my sister called me to tell me my mom blocked me on everything and told her she no longer has 2 daughters just one and that my sister is forbidden from coming to see me or watching the kids while she lives with our mother. Luckily, she will be moving in with her fiance after he gets back from deployment.\n\nThank you for all the advice I did apply online to social security but received an automated email response saying due to the federal shut down the local office is closed they will check my application as soon as someone returns to the office.\n\nAlso, in case anyone wonders, my coworkers knew childcare was a struggle for me but didn\'t have any advice to help me with childcare because most of them dont have kids, pr their kids are already grown. But the lady who offered to help is one of my favorite coworkers and she has come over to help me make decorations for our classrooms at work so she knows my kids and they really seemed to like her whenever she came by to work on work things and I know she is fully certified and train to care for a special needs child as everyone at my place of employment is.\n\n***OOP added one more comment:***\n\nThank you for all the advice, and I appreciate all the kind of words. However, if you are reading this and think it\'s appropriate to message me to hit on me or lecture me about how I need to move on, it is not.

It is a google chrome timer extension. I told them that I would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but I was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer.

My first job out of school, I always wanted to do right by my patients. All these employers wanted to do was make money. No concern for employees (who dropped like flies) and patients (who were constantly mad). Instead of actually caring about the patients concerns, they spent more time micromanaging staff- to the point where they even put timers on our computers and a GPS app on our phones that functioned as a punch clock. They even had managers monitor security cameras to make sure everyone was slaving away. None of us had workspaces and doing simple things like taking  break or listening to music were not allowed. Clearly, if we had time to be human we couldn\'t possibly be working hard enough.\n\nThe owners would NEVER spend money. They didnt buy paper towels, our bathrooms did not have soap, we didnt have water or even cups. There was no coffee or breakroom, people ate lunch in their cars alone because there was no space or utensils.We also had to pay for our own training because they would offer to cover it and then make getting reimbursed really hard. But that is just the beginning they also cut corners when it came to patient safety and privacy. \n\nThey were too cheap to buy masks for providers for when patients came in with diseases like Tuberculosis. When I asked about this they told me I was being a baby. \n\nLastly, they required providers to use personal computers for tasks involving patient data. A major HIPPA violation. Once again, they told me I was wrong when I  brought it up. Btw these are the same personal computers that they put timers on. \n\nNow for the fun part. One of the owners\' favorite employees was pregnant. The owners wanted to have a party for her- but spend no money... how would they do it! Well they knew I had a good relationship with pharmaceutical reps. It just so happened that I had one coming on that Monday. The baby shower was scheduled for Friday. Now the pharmaceutical reps usually brought lunch for everyone and taught about the newest drug. They also brought samples and coupons for the patients.\n\nSo cheap owners had a grand plan- move the baby shower to Monday so that the pharmaceutical rep brings lunch for everyone and they won\'t have to buy it. They even told me to switch the order from my usual chickfila to some fancy vegetarian restaurant because they were vegetarian.\n\nI ended up quitting one day before. The drug rep called my cell phone and asked about the lunch. He knew it was a baby shower and thought it was weird. I agreed and cancelled the lunch, did not tell the owners. I wish I could see their faces when the free food wasn\'t showing up!!! A day or 2 after I left two other employees quit and more will soon follow!\n\nI also reported them to the board of health and HIPPA. Their day will come soon. #CountofMonteCristo.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ofi07p/i_27f_am_being_asked_to_use_my_personal_computer/', 4332, 213, '2025-10-25 10:02:01', '2025-11-07 23:43:29');

I meet every necessary mark 100% of the time and have done so for the last ten years. Maybe an odd month or two in there due to travel and things that would make it impossible. I\'ve also stepped up and carried the load for coworkers when things have come up to ensure our area isn\'t dinged for performance issues. Clients get along well with me, I\'ve never had a complaint filed against me, etc. You get the idea.\n\nI also am known to do all the holiday decorating, coordinating the gifts for office celebrations, baking the desserts, writing formal thank yous from our department, and making holiday baskets to help maintain positive relationships with the other agencies we work with.\n\nA couple months back, there was a policy change and none of us were happy about it. I made the best of a bad situation and adapted to the change immediately. My coworkers did as well, but they all called me to complain and vent. This is normal. We tend to complain amongst ourselves for one good bitch session and then just \"it is what it is\" and continue to work hard and not complain again.\n\nHere\'s where the issue is, while one of my coworkers was venting my boss was eavesdropping selectively on my side of the conversation as that\'s what he could hear. I was commiserating with them, but also pointing out how it wouldn\'t be that bad, it\'s in our contract, how we can make it fun/less obnoxious etc etc etc. We hung up and I didn\'t think about it further, especially since neither of us really said anything that you wouldn\'t expect an employee to say with the kind of change they\'re wanting. It was pretty damn tame....\n\nI didn\'t think about it again until my boss called me in a few days later to do an employee evaluation in response to it.\n\nIn every review I\'ve had here I\'ve always hit the \"exceeds expectations\" in nearly every category. He cut me down to \"meets expectations\" on everything. He reamed me for my \"attitude\" for not cutting my coworker off and letting them vent. Telling me I should have told them to call him. He accused me of being negative/a negative influence and that if he didn\'t \"nip it in the bud now it could fester and create a toxic work environment\".... I was and still am pretty pissed about it. Coworkers should be allowed to vent to each other without it being treated like this.\n\nAfter this, as you may have guessed, I\'m just not in the mood to head up everything extra I\'d been doing to make the office environment \"fun\". I keep my door closed when he\'s here, I didn\'t bring dessert for the March birthday lunch. That lunch isn\'t mandatory, but I didn\'t want more problems so I went and just sat quietly the entire time. \n\nNow there\'s another \"appreciation week/month\" for one of the departments we work with and there\'s been an email chain about cards/gifts and I\'ve responded the amount I\'ll put towards it and asked who I should send it to.... People are noticing I\'m not picking this stuff up and that chain has gone in a circle for days now and I\'m not budging. I\'ve had one person approach me about it and I just said I don\'t have the time to take it on right now.\n\nI guess I\'m feeling like all the shit I did on the regular to foster a positive work environment got thrown out or was never appreciated because I lent an ear to a coworker and then got viciously reprimanded for it. Like what\'s the point if ten years of going out of my way gets thrown out just like that?\n\nAITAH for just quietly stepping out of all of these extras due to my feelings on how this was handled? Am I being overly petty?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TOP/RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**u/canvasshoes2**\n&gt;NTA. The boss, as the kids called it, FAFO\'d.\n&gt;\n&gt;Venting is typically a positive and necessary thing, as long as it\'s handled appropriately, and it sounds as if you were that appropriate \"bottleneck\" and sounding board. He was extremely stupid to have not allowed you to explain the situation to him.\n&gt;\n&gt;Stand your ground. Just keep it light, sweet, and \"My work load is preventing me from keeping up with those extra tasks\" about it all.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*Thank you. I did try to explain it to him when he was marking me down. The real irony is he was sitting there calling me a potential negative toxic presence that was going to ruin team morale the day after I had just handed out hand made Valentine\'s to my other teammates.*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;**u/Scorp128**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with you and absolutely would be hurt in this aspect of having an evaluation weaponized against you. He is toxic management. His actions are going to damage morale more than providing a sympathetic ear will ever do.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;He (boss) is going to try and flip this on you. Now that you\'re not doing the extras that did brighten up your coworkers days, he may try and come back and use this against you.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you have a way to formally dispute the evaluation? Can you speak with HR? He is out of line punishing an employee for listening to someone else vent about the workplace. Venting is healthy. Gets things out in the open so work can continue. I think you need to \"vent\" to someone higher on the food chain that can wrangle him in.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*This one isn\'t the annual so it doesn\'t really count towards anything that could impact pay/raises. If my next one goes like this I will be taking it above him, at that point it will potentially impact my earnings and I refuse to get docked pay when I do so much*\n\n---\n\n**u/CthulhuAlmighty**\n&gt;NTA.\n&gt;\n&gt;You might want to start looking for a new job. Your boss seems to be the type to have the attitude “the beatings will continue until moral improves.” He may end up firing you to “nip it in the bud” and set the other employees straight.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*Oh, that\'s the thing, I love this job, it\'s a good one, and one of the few that still has a union. He wouldn\'t be able to terminate me unless I actually did something crazy or consistently not meet my matrix.*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;**u/Scorp128**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Can you talk to your union representative about what happened here?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*I could, but I\'m holding off unless he tries to take it further than this. My actual review is up in a few months, and if that goes like this again with how good my performance is, I will be.*\n\n---\n\n**u/Candid-Quail-9927**\n&gt;The fact that he took what he overheard and worked that as part of your performance evaluation is extreme and tells me there is something more to this on his side. All the extra that you are doing are not part of your work duties and stepping back is a choice. Simply let people know that you no longer have time to participate or lead such activities. I would watch things carefully and start documenting. Make sure that your silence and non participation is not used against you,\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*That\'s the reason I didn\'t miss the March birthday lunch. I\'m definitely documenting. My plan is to just say \"I don\'t have time with my current case volume\" if anyone asks. I\'ve heard he reviewed the person that was complaining to me too, even though he didn\'t hear their side of the conversation, which I\'m thankful for. Not them getting reviewed, but the not hearing part. They were pretty worked up.*\n\n---\n\n**OOP replying to a big downvoted** [**comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jof3pd/comment/mkrusc7/)\n\n&gt;*I was already not complaining by the time of the eval and he had already seen me coordinate with other team members to \"make a day off it\" so the change felt more like a hangout with work vs. drudgery. I\'m sure he felt like it was a win until I pointed out I\'d already been coordinating and encouraging the team, which he had seen, and felt he was not treating me fairly. The eval was absolutely some stupid power play on his part.... But I think he realizes he fucked up because he hasn\'t been in our office very much since the eval.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*I\'ve been a supervisor. You don\'t ream a good employee on a conversation you half heard bits and pieces of. Even if the content displeased you. You talk to them, and escalate only if it continues.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*I\'m not writing an email to advocate for a change as I equate that to some form of groveling, and I\'m not in a position where I\'d need to. Since my numbers and track record speak volumes on their own, my plan is to take it above him if the eval that matters doesn\'t accurately reflect the data. Then it goes from being my problem to being his to justify to his higher ups and the union. I\'ll also consider a formal grievance at that point.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*You\'re correct, my cutting back on the morale office party shit isn\'t going to change anyone\'s mind, but it\'s not being done with the goal to change anyone\'s mind. I simply don\'t feel like those efforts were considered and weighed before he essentially accused me of being a cancer to the office, which TBH I found to be very demoralizing and hurtful. It\'s hard for me to justify continuing it while I feel this way about it. I just feel like I\'m being an asshole to people that didn\'t do anything by stopping without any explanation or warning.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*I\'ll admit, I shouldn\'t have let people vent to me at the office, that was a mistake on my part, but him performance evaluating the team over it was a huge misstep on his.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*I\'m not planning on quitting. It\'s a good job with a lot of rare benefits. I\'d be an idiot to walk over this, especially where I live. I think when the annual review is up I\'ll know if I\'m going to have to do more.*\n\n---\n# **UPDATE 1: Same Post** - 3 days later\n---\n\nI hope I\'m updating correctly.\n\nSo a lot of people had asked for an update. I\'ve waited a while after some movement/developments.\n\nThere was an event that usually requires someone to head up the card, gift, staff coordination things. I had told the team and my boss several weeks in advance this event was pending and I wouldn\'t be free. No one did anything until the day before and then one of them called me to ask that I do all the leg work.\n\nI declined citing that I just did not have the time. Which was/is true.\n\nMy higher ups cornered me on this a few days later stating that I\'ve been pulling away, teamwork makes the dream work etc. And citing this event as evidence. They also cited me being on my phone during unofficial mandatory fun times as further evidence of drawing back.\n\nI told them that I had given everyone, boss included, weeks of notice that the event was coming up and I wouldn\'t be available to head it up. I pointed out that I\'m still helping the team with tasks directly relevant to work, but with my current caseload I just can\'t afford to allocate time to the social/event planning right now. As for the mandatory fun, I reminded them that I often don\'t get lunch breaks due to community meetings that get held at those hours and my having to flex out early on those days. So having to lose out on a good break on a day I don\'t have to is burning me out.\n\nThey fumbled around for about thirty minutes trying to convince me, and I just held firm that with my current caseload, I don\'t have time to allocate to non-essentials. I was told I\'m allowed to prioritize my breaks.\n\nI\'ve been so busy I haven\'t had a chance to attend the community meetings recently, and honestly, this might be another thing I end up cutting back on in the long run.\n\nOverall it came across like they\'re panicked I\'m considering leaving. There was a comment about that concern and I let them know I\'m not planning on leaving, but I am taking time to restructure my priorities now that my caseload has increased.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TOP/RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**u/Plus_Ad_9181**\n&gt;You’re a woman, aren’t you. Don’t let them use you for free labour like that either way. He can write his own fucking thank you notes.\n&gt;\n&gt;Don’t do anything above your job description. You’ve been there 10 years? It’s time to look for a new job, I bet you’re underpaid too.\n&gt;\n&gt;Curious what the policy change is, though.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*Oh, I\'m not underpaid, I\'m compensated fairly. This is a job worth riding out frustration for. Policy change was to make some nontraditional hours with stipulations mandatory. I\'m sure once the changes inevitably result with problems during standard business hours, they\'ll eventually reconsider this stupid short sighted band aid fix*\n\n---\n\n**u/ThatKaynideGuy**\n&gt;OP it sounds like you have a lot of energy and enjoy doing things/getting things done. Rather than feel bad about work, consider using this energy in circles that will appreciate you. Volunteer work, hobby circles, whatever.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do a bit of volunteer work at the local elementary school and they are 10000% more appreciative of my time than any boss I\'ve ever worked for.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*The nature of my work is emotionally draining. You could describe the relationships with co-workers as trauma bonded at times. I do not have it in me at the end of my 40 hours to do more of what I do at work for no pay. I know that sounds awful, but I need my non-work hours to spend time with friends, family, pets, and hobbies. I can\'t serve from an empty vessel. I know everyone is saying just quit etc... But that\'s realistically not a solution for me. I love the work that I do, I find large areas of it to be incredibly fulfilling, I\'m having a positive impact on my community. I know that I bring a personal history that allows me to be somewhat good at what I do. I\'m not sure they\'d be able to easily find another me, and that\'s unfortunately what the clients on my caseload need. Beyond that, however, I enjoy coming in to work at least 90% of the time. I know I wouldn\'t be able to find another job that checks all the boxes this one does. Especially not where I live.*\n\n---\n\n**u/Asleep_Republic8696**\n&gt;NTA, but seriously, weren\'t you overdoing it? Do your work, enjoy YOUR time.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I never work over 40 hours. My hours end and I walk right out the door and I leave the work phone there too. I don\'t think I was overdoing it, just making sure I was covering those that will cover me when things come up. It\'s not even a weekly occurrence, and they always reciprocate. I still plan on helping cover what needs coverage in regards to things relevant to the job, just not the cards/party planning stuff due to the way in feeling about things right now.*\n\n---\n\n**u/BigPhilosopher4372**\n&gt;No one ever got promoted for making a cake or organizing a birthday party. Wise up ladies. There is a reason men don’t do this and get promoted. They focus on the job not trying to be a mother to the work place.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I have ZERO desire to be promoted. I left a managerial position where I ran three programs to do this job. Less work, more pay, less responsibility. Not everyone fantasizes about job titles.*\n\n---\n\n**u/shannann1017**\n&gt;1, how the hell are you achieving “Exceeds Expectations”?? I have done everything extra, volunteered for additional tasks &amp;\nResponsibilities and have only ever gotten “Meets”. Last year I actually got sick of it and asked what it actually takes and was told flat out that corporate designs the metric to make it impossible. He’s a typical mid mgmt corporate jackhole. Took a one sided conversation clip and got scared and offended his bullshit isn’t being eaten up with a smile. Then just cracks down on you overall over one incident where he was eavesdropping? F him NTA.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I am very detail oriented, organized, and efficient to a fault. A lot of stuff I do simply because I feel guilty for having free time at work. I could probably complete my entire job functions each week in like twenty hours if it was allowed that option. I\'ve always been like this, I probably have some kind of disorder 😂. I\'m just as bad at home. My husband has told me that I complete more in the time between waking and getting to work than a lot of people manage in an entire day. The job I left for this one had to hire more than one person to replace me, but training was probably easy because I wrote a guide on what needed to be done daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annually and gave them my spreadsheets. I know if I reached out to that previous job they\'d snap me up in an instant, but their pay and benefits are shit.*\n\n---\n\n**u/toxic_averse**\n&gt;Any update on your boss\' reaction? So invested in your story. 😊\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*Not really. Hate to disappoint. The thing is, he\'s a pretty decent boss most of the time. I think that\'s why I was so shocked about this whole situation. We don\'t have a lot of non-mandatory-mandatory-fun stuff in our office so I guess there haven\'t been many opportunities. I\'m holding strong to just not heading it up. I\'m doing my job and that\'s about it. My co-workers haven\'t reached out at all this week, so I think they\'re processing how to approach my sudden weirdness/distance.*\n\n---\n# **UPDATE 2: Same post** \n---\n\nAnnual performance evaluation is in and it\'s just as dismal as the retaliatory one. I\'ve declined signing it without discussion and I\'ve contacted my Union. This feels like punitive retaliation. If they can\'t justify the decreases despite my consistent quality performance I will be quiet quitting everything that\'s not a core job function as continuing to do so will feel like chasing an unattainable metric.\n\n\n---\n# Final Update in the comments - 6.5 Months later\n---\n\n[**Final Update in comments**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jof3pd/comment/new2itg/)\n\nUnion advised that technically the review is valid as they\'re going by the letter of the set parameters and boss advised that since I meet my deadlines and quotas it\'s valid. I have gone the route of quiet quitting. Nothing outside the minimum to meet expectations so my raises aren\'t impacted. I\'ve called in sick on a few days there was \"non mandatory but unspoken mandatory fun\". I\'ve ceased community outreach so that I\'m not missing my breaks. Coworkers are aware there was unjust retaliation. More changes have come that impact management. Boss is talking about taking a job with less of a commute. I know I\'ll be encouraged to apply for their position, all I\'m going to do when that happens is laugh.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**I am not the OOP.

Homeland Security Responded\nThe federal agency has previously spoken out against other celebrities.\n\nThis is what happens when “Hot to Go!” meets “Can’t let anything go.”\n\nAfter pop superstar Chappell Roan criticized Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a recent Los Angeles concert, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responded with an alarmist and misleading statement.\n\nWhile speaking to concertgoers at the Pasadena Rose Bowl on Friday, Roan took a moment to weigh in on the ICE raids currently ongoing outside the stadium’s walls. She started off by appreciating Los Angeles, which she called “the city that took care of me.”\n\n“And it’s only my duty to take care of it,” she continued. “Fuck ICE forever,” Roan added, to raucous applause. After shaking her head and looking generally upset by, she repeated: “Fuck ICE.”\n\nWhile fans certainly loved to hear Roan speak out against government deportations, ICE itself did not. The next day, in a statement to TMZ, DHS’s assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Pink Pony Club is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip.”\n\nDespite President Trump saying that ICE would target “the worst of the worst” for deportation, the agency’s own internal data shows that the largest group of people ICE has detained are actually those with no prior criminal record. A June study from the CATO Institute found that not only did 65% of people arrested by ICE have no prior convictions, 93% had no prior violent convictions, either\n\nRoan has been known for being outspoken about important political issues. While winning the Grammy for best new artist in February, the singer used her time on stage to advocate for all musical artists to be given health care through their record companies.\n\nConcerts such as Roan’s have become a flashpoint for concerns over ICE-led raids. In September, megastar Bad Bunny announced that he would not embark on a stateside tour over concerns that his shows would become sites of potential ICE activity.\n\nThe federal agency has proven to be thin-skinned when it comes to any public admonishment of their actions. In September, Hacks actor Hannah Einbinder closed her Emmys speech by saying, “Go Birds, fuck ICE and free Palestine!” In a response given to TMZ, DHS’s McLaughlin issued a statement saying rhetoric like Einbinder’s is “inspiring violence against our ICE law enforcement,” which she claimed was “facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them.” No data backs up McLaughlin’s claim about a dramatic increase in anti-ICE violence, per Oregon Public Broadcasting.\n\n“As this woman fans the flames of hatred, our brave law enforcement will continue enforcing the rule of law and protecting Americans,” McLaughlin continued.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem responded directly to a parody of her in an episode of South Park that targeted the ICE raids, as well as her personally, in August.\n\n“It’s so lazy to just constantly make fun of women for how they look,” Noem said of the episode on the Glenn Beck Program podcast, per The Guardian. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that.

I was asked to be the maid of honor and was extremely happy to do so. Over the past year I helped her with whatever needed to be done. Throughout all of this I talked to my boyfriend about it. He knew how happy I was for her, he knew that I had a big part in the wedding, he knew my parents would be attending the wedding, he knew everything that I knew about the wedding. He knew the day &amp; time, and what would be expected of him and when he needed to show up. \n\n\nFWIW, I didn\'t talk his ear off about the wedding. I would only really talk about it if I had gone, for example, dress shopping or something with my friend. \n\n\nHowever, last week (a couple days before the wedding) he started to act kinda weird about it. He said something along the lines of \"I know you don\'t want to be involved in the wedding, it will be over soon. And then you can forget all about it and everything will be normal again.\" I\'ve been nothing but happy and excited for my friend and this wedding. But, he continued to act like I wasn\'t having fun and tried to convince me that I hated every minute of helping my friend plan her wedding. Last week he continued talking about the wedding like it was something awful and stupid. He treated it as annoying chore we had to do, he complained about having to go. He even asked me after the rehearsal dinner if he could just not go to the wedding at all - keep in mind I had already RSVP\'ed for both of us, my parents were expecting him, he just dropped that on me as we were going to bed before the wedding day.  He also never expressed his congratulations towards the bride or groom at any point. \n\n\nThe day of the wedding was this past Saturday. I told my boyfriend what time he needed to show up. Lately he has been notoriously late for everything, like several hours late to anything he\'s invited to - he\'s always been late, but it\'s been getting ridiculous. A lot of times he\'s late because he is hanging out with one his friends smoking weed and playing video games, and he ends up losing track of time. I didn\'t want him to be late to my best friend\'s wedding, so I basically told him he needed to be there 3 hours earlier than what was necessary (I told him he needed to be there at 1pm, when in reality he needed to be there before 4:30pm, he showed up around 4:30pm). \n\n\nHe got there right as cocktail hour started and got drunk, I was told by someone else that he was pounding back the beers as soon as the bartender started to serve alcohol. Then he sat with my parents, and told my mom \"if I didn\'t come to this thing OP would have killed me.\" Once the bride and groom were announced Mr &amp; Mrs X, my boyfriend loudly cheered and loudly clapped as everyone else did a normal clap. It wasn\'t a very big wedding so it was weird and awkward when he did this. It stood out a lot and obvious that he was already inebriated. Multiple people looked over at him in a \"wtf\" way. I felt awful and embarrassed when this happened. \n\n\nAfter all the photos were taken he found me and told me that his work called and that he needed to go in ASAP. Before the wedding he assured me that he had taken the day off and that his work (he\'s a bartender) knew he would be at a wedding that day. I knew he was lying to me, but I didn\'t care at that point. He left (ubered) to supposedly go to work. When I finally got home around 2am he told me that it turned out that work didn\'t actually need him and he \"forgot\" the name of the venue so he couldn\'t uber back to it, and that his phone was acting weird and couldn\'t get a text message to be sent to me. He told me how he really wanted to come back to the reception but he just couldn\'t make it happen. Obviously those were all lies.\n\n\nI feel like his behavior was just abhorrent. I\'m so pissed off at him right now, I\'m looking at him in a new negative light and I can\'t stop thinking about how awful he was throughout this whole wedding event. I know some people act weird about weddings sometimes, but this takes the fucking cake. Is there any coming back from this? I feel like I\'m always going to be pissed off about what happened. I don\'t know if I can forgive him. \n\n\nI\'ve thought about ending it with him because of this. I don\'t know if I\'m overreacting or not. I don\'t think he has any intentions on apologizing. We haven\'t talked about the wedding that much since this past Saturday. He doesn\'t think he\'s done anything wrong. What do I do? Am I crazy to think his actions are god awful?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt;Girl, he sounds like a toddler.  You’re a girlfriend not a mother, why are you putting up with this?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, I don\'t know. We\'ve been together for about 4 years now, and he wasn\'t always this bad. But, I\'ve noticed his behavior has gone downhill over the past year. He\'s cut back hours on work and makes just enough money to make ends meet. He just wants to hang out with his friends who don\'t have jobs. He smokes for free with them. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think this may be the last straw though. I\'m going to to have to end it with him. It just sucks, because he wasn\'t always this bad.\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Consider that he was always like this, but you\'re growing up and maturing whereas he hasn\'t. 4 years puts you guys at 27 and 20. Might be that you just didn\'t notice b/c you had different priorities.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a strong possibility. When we met I was in college, and like a lot of college students I went out partied a lot, I had fun and stayed up super late. But, now I\'m working full-time and going to grad school part time. I want to be successful in the future. He has basically stayed the same these past 4 years. He always talked about going back to school and finishing his degree or doing something else with his life, he just hasn\'t done anything with himself. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don\'t think I really saw that or cared when we met and I was only 20.\n\n**~**\n\n**SmallSacrifice**\n\n&gt; How long have you been dating?  Have you two discussed marriage?\n&gt;\n&gt; His behavior was horrendous...I don\'t know if I would forgive it.  My guess is that he saw you all happy about the wedding, doesn\'t want to commit, got scared you would now expect a proposal, and deliberately sabotaged everything because he is a giant, immature douche canoe.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; We\'ve been together for about 4 years. We have talked about marriage, he has brought up in the past and mentioned that it would be great if we got married one day. I\'ve told him I wanted to wait until after I finished grad school and we moved into a house first. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, I am rethinking our entire relationship now. After reading a few responses here, I feel like I probably won\'t be able to forgive him after this.\n\n**~**\n\n**i-Ake**\n\n&gt; What is he benefit of staying with this guy? He sounds awful. I was really surprised to see that he is *my age* and not also in his early 20s. \n&gt;\n&gt; My boyfriend hates weddings and big parties and a lot of traditions, lol, but he just lets me know. He has GAD so I get it. We have agreements about which ones are mandatory and which he can skip. He doesn\'t pull weird manipulations like this. \n&gt;\n&gt; I don\'t think I could be with someone who jerked me around and lied like that... and he is 31 years old!! That is too old for this shit, IMO. How do you guys even communicate? Mutual affection and respect?\n&gt;\n&gt; My advice is to cut your losses. It will hurt, but I bet you will feel relieved after a while of not having this anchor around your neck. Find someone worth it.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; This was the first time he pulled this much shit to get out of an obligation. Before now he has been okay going with me to various friend or family events. This also wasn\'t our first wedding together either, his aunt got remarried last year and he didn\'t freak out then. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the past he\'s told me straight up if he didn\'t want to go to one of my friend\'s parties or something, and he stayed at home and it was fine.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\n**I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I was wanting to create a throwaway account so my post wouldn\'t be that noticeable. Oh well, my boyfriend uses reddit but I don\'t think he goes to the relationship subreddits at all.**\n\n**Anyway, I\'ve tried  most of the comments here and I\'ve been thinking about what you all have said. It\'s basically confirmed that I need to end things with him. I actually tried to end things with him a couple of hours ago. He doesn\'t seem to be accepting the breakup. He started to apologize to me about what happened and how he\'ll try to be better.**\n\n**I\'m currently at a friend\'s house for the night. I brought some things with me that should last a couple of days.**\n\n**But I\'m really not sure what else to do. Both of our names are on the lease, and he\'s still at the apartment for all I know.**\n\n**Thank you for all the help. Reading through the comments basically told me everything I already knew and confirmed for me that I need to dump his ass. I\'ll try to post an update in a couple of days.**\n\n**As of now he doesn\'t seem to want to leave the apartment, so we\'ll see what happens.**\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/DRdSeW8bGJ)  **March 6, 2020 (9 days later)**\n\nFirst, thank you to everyone who commented on my last post. It gave me a lot of think about, and confirmed things for me that I wasn\'t ready to admit to myself. \n\n\nSecond, there were some frequent comments about my ex I wanted to clear up. Some people thought he had anxiety around weddings or people he didn\'t know. He knew the bride and groom very well, as we use to go out on double dates a lot. He\'s even spent some one on one time with the groom. He knew a lot of other people at the wedding. He only sat with my parents b/c my parents didn\'t really know anyone else besides the bride and couple of my other friends (who were bridesmaids or were part of the wedding in some way.) He is a social butterfly and has been to more weddings than me. He\'s even gone solo to a couple of weddings he was invited to (no plus one) for former coworkers while we were together. \n\n\nMany people suggested he had a crush on the bride. I can\'t confirm this, but I\'m leaning towards no. It\'s possible of course, doesn\'t matter at this point. All I can really say is they are complete opposites, have very little in common, and he would consider her \"not his type\" (this is not an insult to the bride, she is a beautiful person FWIW.) And I am considered \"his type.\" Again, he may have had feelings for her, but if he did I never picked up on it. \n\n\nAfter I initially tried to end it with him, he texted/called/dm\'ed me and basically used any means of communication possible to get my attention. He started by apologizing  profusely and asking to give him another chance. I didn\'t respond to all of this, because I didn\'t know what to say. I turned off my phone before I went to sleep and woke up with a fuck ton of voicemail and messages. He sounded extremely angry in some of them, called me names, told me he hated me, said the classic line of \"you\'ll never do better than me.\" \n\n\nSome of the last messages he sent were him apologizing for the messages he left throughout the night because he was drunk, and that it didn\'t count. Whatever. \n\n\nThe apartment issue has been a nightmare, it\'s going to be extremely expensive to get out of the lease and only have his name in it. Apparently they need both of our signatures in order for this to happen, and I\'ll need to pay a fee. The only communication I\'ve had with my ex is to ask him to sign the new leasing agreement, which he refuses to do. I still had to pay rent for March. The lease isn\'t up for several more months. I can\'t afford to pay two rents at once. \n\n\nI did manage to get my stuff out. I called up the bar he works for and talked to one of the women there I felt comfortable with. I told her my situation and asked if she could call me the next time he showed up for his shift so I could get my things. I had a bunch of my friends come to the apartment with boxes and plastic tubs and got most of my stuff. Unfortunately my TV (it\'s huge), sofa and a couple of other larger things couldn\'t be grabbed. But I got everything important. \n\n\nWhen he found out I took all of my stuff the text messages and voicemail began again, where he spewed more vitriol at me and demanding me to \"come home immediately.\" The next he started sending me apology messages. And also told me in a message that he\'s \"willing to forgive me and move on from this mess.\" \n\nMy current challenges are trying to find a place to live for the next few months &amp; what to do about the current lease with both our names. I have friends that understand my situation, and are allowing me to couch surf for a bit. But it\'s not a permanent solution. I\'m still trying to figure out how to get out this lease, but the apartment management has been difficult. I\'m not totally convinced that they need both signatures, but that\'s what they keep stressing. The worst case scenario is that I have to quit my job and live with my parents for a bit (they are an hour away) and drive an hour to class a few times a week until the semester is over.\n\nTL;DR: We are broken up and I\'m feeling great about this decision. Apartment management sucks and I can\'t get my name of the lease. Some of my stuff is still in the apartment, but I got the important stuff out. Ex keeps messaging me, he\'s either being a dick or apologizing. \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o3ltn2/my_24f_boyfriend_31m_got_trashed_at_a_wedding/', 4129, 217, '2025-10-11 10:00:08', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),
(150, 'reddit', '1o0l9hd', 'AITAH for giving my bf an ultimatum after his dog sent me to the ER?', 'Firstly, I LOVE DOGS. I LOVE ANIMALS AS A WHOLE. But my safety comes before them. My bf and I have been now living together for 7 months. When we met, he lived alone in an apartment with a 5 yr old male Belgian Malinois (for those who don’t know this breed, it’s the police dog used in k9). When my bf brought the idea to me about living together, I was concerned about having such a large dog, who apparently was trained to attack and be a guard dog. My bf told me at the time he lived in an area where he was burglarized twice and since then got the dog for protection and trained him to be ruthless. I was obviously uncomfortable with this information. I told him he would need to be in his cage inside of my apartment until the dog gets use to me. He agreed and moved in, I have since then fed the dog on my own in the mornings, allow him to smell me and give him a sit command before opening his cage. He has not shown me any aggression. He is walked several times a day, but I know keeping this kind of dog in a cage is not ideal. We planned to purchase a home together with a yard so he can roam free, but with unfortunate financial burdens we have to post pone those plans. To get to the point, this past weekend I was on my balcony when my bf said he was going to bring the dog out on the balcony as well to get air. I was fine with this. I decided to go inside to grab a blanket when the dog came out the cage and charged at me. My back was turned and he bite down on to my asscheek. When I screamed he let go and bite down again; it happened so fast I was in shock. My bf of course grabbed him and put him back in the cage to come to my aid. Blood was everywhere and I was in such shock that I didn’t realize I was still screaming. My bf rushed me to the ER and when I got into the bed I said to him “you either move out and take your dog with you or give him up. It’s either me or him.” He was absolutely apologetic, in shock too and even cried. He kept repeating that no one is going to take him because of the aggression and he doesn’t want to put him down either. I reminded him that we want a family one day and I will not be in a home with my children scared of their safety and mine.\nWe would need a family dog that’s good with people especially kids. What if it was my face the dog attacked? What if it was his child? All this happened 4 days before my 35th birthday and I’m devastated. \n\nAITAH?\n\n*EDIT\n\nSome of y’all are PMO. To clarify, I did not give my bf the ultimatum to either euthanize his dog or be with me. I SAID “YOU EITHER MOVE OUT WITH YOUR DOG OR GIVE HIM UP.” I would never encourage putting a dog to sleep! I’m the victim here and who’s the one telling my bf the dog needs to be rehomed with professionals who can retrain him. \n\n\n***************\n10/08 UPDATE:\n\n\nI surely did not expect the overwhelming responses to my story. I can’t keep up with 500+ comments,  but I wanted to update y’all with more specifics for those who are asking questions.\n\nMy wounds are extremely black and blue as you can imagine. No shot required, but on antibiotics for 7 days. Dog has all his shots. \n\nI said previously that my bf “trained him to attack and be a guard dog.” I should’ve been more mindful about this not being the correct way to describe it. To clarify, no the dog is not professionally trained.\n\nMy bf, while incredibly irresponsible and selfish for raising him to be this way (I agree 1000%), he’s acknowledged many times before how he’s failed his dog and made poor decisions; he’s been trying to correct it. He showers him with love and constantly plays with the him. My Bf is not a monster, but yes an asshole for his past mistakes. \n\nWhile I’m at work, (bf works remotely) the dog is roaming the living room within supervision. THE DOG IS NOT IN THE CAGE ALL DAY LONG. I work in healthcare and I’m gone usually 7AM-5PM.\n\nWhen he’s in his cage, he is not territorial or aggressive for those asking. Unless someone knocks on the door. He is not aggressive with his food, my bf constantly put his hands in his bowl (apparently he’s been doing this since a puppy) and he doesn’t react. I however would not, will not ever do that. I understand he trusts his owner 1000% and no one else. \n\nWhen he moved in 7 months ago, I encouraged him to get a shock collar because he would not listen. He would bark at other dogs and people, pull hard on the leash. Bark at company over. He’s very alert and jumpy (moves quickly) — with  training with the collar (using the vibration he stops usually, but he’s shocked when absolutely necessary), he has shown improvement. Just to point out, I don’t touch that remote at all. Bf uses it only. \n\nThe day the incident happened, I had been socializing with him in the morning. The dog let me pet him, he smelled my hand first then licked me, took off his shock collar and fed him. My bf was asleep during this time. I now realize how incredibly dangerous that was, but again, zero aggression.\n\nThe blanket situation: when the dog bit me, I did not have the blanket in my hands yet. (throw blanket I have on my sofa.) I was facing the sofa and my back was to the dog. However, I did have fuzzy pink shorts on, but not sure how that can be a trigger? \n\nAccording to my bf, he was excited when he came out the cage. Since we had been socializing, my bf thought it would ok to let him out (he asked first). I was ok with it because of the good behavior. I said in my story the dog charged at me because I felt the force when he went mouth first onto my freaking ass. Before biting, he seemed to sniff quickly first which my bf said it didn’t seem alarming until obviously he bit unprovoked. There was no growl, no bark, nothing. He bit down letting go briefly and then bit down again. Clearly this was not playful (or excitement?) if I have holes in my ass leaking blood??? \n\nI gave my ultimatum out of fear, pain and anger. BF did not choose the dog over me — he took accountability, took care of me and apologized. He agreed to find a home for him with someone who knew how to train this kind of breed, but sincerely begged for another chance. \n\nI want to give the dog another chance because he HAS shown improvement in the last 7 months, and I don’t blame the dog. I blame my man. And clearly\nIm simply fearful. And traumatized. We agreed that he will have a muzzle on when socializing with me and with others and of course on walks. He will be getting neutered asap. More outside time than what he previously had. BF is putting together money to get him trained professionally since he, as we know, cannot do this on his own. Hoping we can get our house sooner than later so he can roam the yard as well. \n\nI would prefer to give him a second chance with professional help over anything else.. at the end of the day I do love my boyfriend and the dog regardless.. this was a wake up call for him. Unfortunately I was hurt in the process, but my guards are now up HIGH  —stronger precautions and boundaries. \n\nI’m praying hard that he can be rehabilitated. And I hope to God I don’t regret this.

Dad remarried when I was 17. My stepmom has a daughter (f15), she and dad had a boy(m3), and now she just gave birth to a little girl.\n\nAnyway, I have worked since I was 16, to have so money to buy stuff for me. When I turned 18, dad said I was now an adult and should start paying rent. It was \"only\" 500 dollars. A symbolic amount since he would still cover food and other essentials. I was mad and we fought, but in the end I accepted and that was the arrangement until 7 months ago.\n\nDad came to me saying I had 2 months to move out, stepmom was pregnant and they would need my room for the baby. Which is insane because they both have private offices. My stepmom doesn\'t even need one since she\'s a SAHM since the birth of my baby brother. Nonetheless they told me I had to move.\n\nBTW, just an addendum: Me and Stepmom get well fine. We don\'t fight or bicker. I don\'t think this was a evil stepmom moment, but who knows? Me and stepsister are actually pretty close, I help her with homework, and talk about her personal problems, I do love her very much.\n\nBack to the story, I didn\'t know what to do. I\'m going to a college, (I want to be a civil engineer), and work part time. I don\'t have the means to live by myself.\n\nI called my aunt, asking if I could move in with her for the time being, until I figured something out, offered to pay rent and all. She was aghast at what dad was doing, she said I absolutely could live with her, no rend needed, but also said she was gonna deal with my dad.\n\nThe next day Grampa came to our house, and they talked privately, I could hear my dad angry voice, but couldn\'t understand anything being said. After a while Grampa came to my room and said I had 3 choices. The first was continue living with dad and stepmom like I was doing, nothing would change except without paying rent. The second was moving in with him and grama, or my aunt. Third was find a place of my own and he would pay the rend and costs for me.\n\nHe said I didn\'t need to choose now, I could keep living with dad and if I changed my mind to just tell him. I was actually relived I could still live with dad, and that this madness was over. But the following days and weeks, dad and stepmom were very hostile towards me, and I felt incredibly uncomfortable being in my own home. Even Cassie pick this up and asked me why they were angry at me.\n\nSo I decided to move out and told grampa. He said he would take care of everything... few weeks later he moved me in into ones of his rental units. The apartment is lovely, he bought me a fridge, stove, and other essential itens, he gave me a check for 15000 saying this money is to help me start living on my own. And that as long as I am working or studying, I can live there rent free, for as long as I want.\n\nMy dad and I have been pretty low contact since I moved out. He never came to visit me, or I visit them. I miss them a lot, specially my step sister, but am still hurt.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my stepmom gave birth, I visited them in the hospital. It was a little awkward, but nice seeing them and my baby sister. Anyway, few days ago dad calls me, saying he misses me, the children misses me, and I should move back home. He apologized for asking me to move out, etc etc etc. And I told him I would think about it.\n\nYesterday I visited my aunt, and was telling her what my dad said, and my cousin laughed a little and said \"I\'m sure he does...\". I asked what he meant, and that\'s when they told me a lot of, until now, unknown information.\n\nBasically, my dad\'s home, is actually my grampa\'s. (As is my aunt\'s). Basically the deal he made with me, he did with all his kids and some grandkids as well. He never wanted any of his family to have to worry about basic stuff like house, and food, etc.\n\nWhen I called my aunt that time, she called grampa, which was furious with dad, not only for kicking me out, but also for charging me rent. That day he went to my dad\'s and tore him a new one, and threatened to have him evicted.\n\nBut now the \"petty\" part, you know that 15k grampa gave me? It\'s actually what I paid dad in rent all that time. And now he\'s making dad pay him back. Also... he\'s charging dad 1200 dollars for the rent loss in apartment I\'m living in.\n\nCall me dumb, or naïve, but until now, I never realized my dad didn\'t make that much money. We lived in a great house, always went on vacations, and lived very comfortable lives, but I guess grampa has always been helping behind the scenes.\n\nNow my cousin thinks dad is struggling, with 3 kids at home, a single income, and having to pay it back to grampa. So he says Dad wants me back, because he imagines grampa will stop \"punishing\" him if I\'m back living with them.\n\nHonestly... I don\'t know what to do. I\'m actually loving living on my own these past 6 months. But I do really miss them, I miss my siblings. I miss the life we had before all of this, but I don\'t know if moving back home is the right answer, and also... I\'m hurt the reason he wants me back is money.\n\n\\----\n\nHonestly... I just wanted to vent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/ZJGVvqIZwU): **June 17, 2024 (eight days later)**\n\nI wanted to give you guys an update, since you\'ve all been so helpful and kind to me. I was so overwhelmed by the support you gave me. Thanks 1000 times.\n\nBefore, just answering some questions people had. My aunt and grampa are from my father side of the family. My mom side unfortunately I don\'t have much contact. My grandparents have passed away before mom, I have uncles and aunts, I see once in a while, but they don\'t live close. I also have 2 other uncles from my father side, I\'m close to them, but not as near my aunt. She was my rock when mom died. I consider her a second mom.\n\nMy stepmom knew about the rent I was paying, it was implied step sister would need to do the same when she turned 18. But I don\'t know if she knew dad didn\'t own the house, or the extend of how much grampa has financially helped dad.\n\n----\n\nTo the update:\n\nMonday, the day after my post, I called dad and said I decided to not move back. I didn\'t mentioned anything I was told, just that was well settled here, and moving back seamed like a step back. But I also said I wanted to keep in contact with them. They could invite me for dinner whenever they wanted, and I also said I would love for my step sister and brother, to be able to spend time with me here at home.\n\nHe was disappointed, and I didn\'t feel any angriness in his tone at least. But he basically said a \"We\'ll see\" and left at that. I was also disappointed.\n\nBut then Friday he called me, asked me if I wanted to have launch Sunday (today), I said I already had plans with grampa and gramma, he asked when I would be free. So we schedule a dinner for Thursday.\n\nI haven\'t told any of this to my step sister, we talk and text regularly. She also haven\'t heard they talking about me. But she did say her gramma (her mom\'s mom) is there to help with the baby and is being incredibly annoying. I laughed at that. I wanted to offer her to sleepover here, but didn\'t want to get her excited just for dad to say no, so I\'ll try talk with them Thursday.\n\nThe big update is I\'ve just came back from visiting grampa and gramma. We spend a lovely day together. But I also said I wanted to know everything that was going on. I wasn\'t a kid anymore and I felt like living in lies.\n\nThe most important things were things my cousin and aunt told me last week. But there were a few more. Grampa had been subsidizing quite often our basic needs, like school, healthcare, etc... because Dad haven\'t one cent saved up according to grampa. Also my college fund was mainly contributed by him (And mom before her passing). I guess that makes sense. I was also dumb to not realize this sooner. He also have set up funds for my baby siblings... and also one for my step sister. Because he didn\'t want her to feel excluded and not have the same opportunities as her siblings.\n\nThis man is incredible. I love him so so much. (And yes... I\'m very very luck. I\'ve seen so many people commenting this, not in a derogatory way, but being very supportive and nice. I know I\'m very privilegied to have grandparents and family members who can afford and are willing to help me. I hope one day I can help others the way they are helping me)\n\nAnyways... I also expressed worries about dad financial situation... and he assured me dad is fine, more than fine. He will have to be less frivolous with money for a while, but that he would never let any of his kids or grandkids to suffer, or be in the need for anything. As many of you said he\'s trying to teach Dad a lesson \"I should\'ve taught him a long time ago\". So I\'ll stay out of it. I don\'t think I\'ll tell Dad that I know all of this. I know many of you said to confront him, but I think it\'s for the best if he continuous thinking I\'m oblivious.\n\nLastly, we talked about why dad kick me out. He didn\'t have an answer either, I could see he and gramma were very hurt by what dad did. He said he asked for an explanation but got none.\n\nThat\'s it for now. I\'ll continue trying have a relationship with my siblings outside of my dad and stepmom. I also try to schedule some weekly dinner with them... I know what you guys said about my father is mostly true. But I need to at least try have a relationship with him, if not for him, for my siblings, and for me.\n\nBut don\'t worry, I\'ll won\'t let him hurt me anymore.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[[Small update] Grampa is punishing my dad: Dinner went well. Spend the weekend with sister. But no new info.](https://redd.it/1doibeo): **June 25, 2024 (eight days later)**\n\nThere isn\'t much of an update, but some people message me asking about how was the dinner.\n\nSo last Thursday I went there after work. Gosh... I missed my siblings so much... and I spend majority of the time with them. My baby brother is not a baby anymore, he have grown so much. My baby sister is so cute... I could eat her alive. I never want to be apart from them anymore, doesn\'t matter what happens. Cassie (I said her name once in my original post by mistake, she\'s my step sister), is the only one I maintained regular contact through calls and text, she\'s just an amazing person as well. She knows I didn\'t move out in the best of circumstances, but doesn\'t know the details, or anything about the money.\n\nI asked if she wanted to have a sleepover at my house sometime, and she was thrilled. If I hadn\'t stopped her, she would\'ve start packing at that second.\n\nMy stepmom\'s mom was still there to help with the baby. And guess where she\'s staying? In my old bedroom, they transformed it into a guest room. And the baby room was stepmom\'s old office (\"Because it\'s closer to the master\"). Honestly, that hurt a little.\n\nI\'ve only met my stepmom parents a few times, they were always nice to me, this time she kept looking at me weird, all the time. Didn\'t matter where I was or where I moved, she was keeping track of me, like she was expecting me to try and steal something. When I was holding the baby didn\'t leave my side.\n\nAnyway, apart from that dinner went as well as you can imagine. A little awkward, but I was glad I could she my siblings and spend a few hours playing with them. At the end I mentioned Cassie having a sleepover in the weekend. Her grandmother started saying that absolutely not, Cassie would not go... but to my surprise stepmom stopped her. She said if Cassie wanted I could pick her up Saturday after soccer practice.\n\nFor dinner that was that. When I was leaving stepmom gave me a really tie hug.\n\nSo many people were saying how she\'s just a evil stepmom that I kinda started to believe. But as I said in my first post, we always had a good relationship. I left very confused and emotional.\n\nSaturday afternoon I picked Cassie, we watched Inside Out 2, then we ate Shawarma for the first time (witch is basically a meat burrito. I don\'t see the difference.)\n\nIt was so good to spend the day with her. I\'m so glad to have her in my life.\n\nSunday I dropped her off, and went inside to see my other siblings, Dad wasn\'t there, he was out meeting a work friend (Some people asked what my dad Does, he\'s a lawyer, and stepmom used to work for an advertisement company, but is now a SAHM).\n\nWe have another dinner schedule for Friday.\n\nI don\'t know if I\'ll ever find out exactly why they wanted me to move, or why charge me rent. I don\'t want to touch the subject now, because I don\'t want to jeopardize my relationship with my siblings. So I don\'t know if I\'ll have anymore updates since things are settling down and is now just life.\n\nBut if I find out in the future I\'ll update.\n\nYou guys have been incredible, thanks so much for all the words of kindness and support your gave me. Talking it out and then reading your replies have helped immensely. I also took people\'s suggestions and do therapy, and this Friday will is be my first session.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose-Charge281/comments/1dxq58i/update_grampa_is_punishing_my_dad_dad_came_clean/): **July 7, 2024 (12 days later)**\n\nSo things blew up a little, and I don\'t even know where to start. I still haven\'t processed everything I\'ve been told.\n\nSince my last update, things have been normal, from my side. I had another dinner with my parents the friday before last, stepmom\'s mom (Who I\'ll call Ebby, meaning Evil Bitch (Spoilers)) was still giving me the dirty eye, but I ignored her. I had scheduled dinner with them for last friday, and I was talking to them about taking my little brother to the park yesterday, but Wednesday my dad called me asking if I could instead postpone dinner, and instead go to grampa\'s on Saturday because he needed to talk with the whole family.\n\nMeanwhile I had been talking to Cassie and she\'s been telling me Stepmom (I\'ll call her Steh) and Ebby have been fighting a lot. Well... last Sunday Steh\'s father shows up (I\'ll call him Laby, meaning Lying Bastard), there\'s a big fight and Laby and Ebby go back home on Monday.\n\nSo yesterday afternoon I go to grampa\'s, my aunt was there as well, then dad and Steh arrive with Cassie.\n\nDad was clearly embarrassed. He apologized to me, to my grandparents. Steh apologized to me as well. And dad gave an explanation / apology / reason for everything that happened in the last few years. Some things I already knew, but Cassie didn\'t (she was present for the whole thing).\n\nSo I\'ll try to tell everything here, I don’t know how coherent I’ll be, but I hope you can follow me:\n\nYears and years ago, grampa and a friend started a company. The company was very successful. When dad was 25, grampa sold the company and made a lot of money. So he decided to gift each child a home. He gave his kids 350k each, with the promise they would use to buy homes or pay out the mortgages. Grampa had seen people lose their homes, and didn\'t want that to happen to his kids.\n\nDad didn\'t buy a home however. He actually moved to New York, to start his own practice and become a \"big and successful lawyer\". And as you can imagine, things didn\'t turn out so well for him. Half a decade later, he has no money left, can\'t pay rent, so he reaches out to grampa, and moves back home.\n\nGrampa helps him find a job with a buddy of his. After a while, dad starts to put his life back together, rents a home and move out from grampa\'s, meets my mom and starts dating her. They fall in love, after a while he asks to marry her.\n\nBefore they married, grampa came to them, and said he would gift them a home. He had already talked with his other kids, and they were fine with it. But because he didn\'t trust dad, and the home is so dad\'s future kids would always have a roof over their heads, the home would stay in his name, and in his will, they would go directly to dad\'s kids.\n\nSo I was actually mistaken before, my uncles and aunt don\'t live in homes owned by grampa, only my dad does. (And I think 2 cousins of mine as well)\n\nNext thing I was born. Life is good for a while... then mom passes away. Dad struggles with taking care of me alone. That\'s when grampa starts to help financially. Few more years, dad meets Steh, but dad is embarrassed about not owning the house, and that grampa is helping him, so he never tells Steh any of this. For her dad was just a moderately successful lawyer. They marry, she becomes pregnant, she asks if she could become a full time SAHM, and dad is embarrassed to say no. So he tells her it\'s fine. In the meanwhile, now with 3 kids, plus a SAHM wife, dad is struggling even more, grampa is helping more, and dad’s savings are being diminished day by day.\n\nDad admits that he kinda threw Steh under the bus to grampa. Blaming her for his financial problems to Grampa, so grampa would continue helping for the sake of the kids.\n\nNow I need to go back a little and talk about Laby and Ebby. Just as Steh, they think dad is a rich successful lawyer. And they start saying to dad how he’s spoiling me, how I\'m gonna be irresponsible with money, how I have an easy life. That when Laby was my age, he had to pay rent to his dad, and he did the same with his son, (Steh\'s brother), and how successful they became, never needing anything from anybody, bootstraps, etc... etc... etc...\n\nAnd apparently that got into dad\'s head. He became afraid I would be dependent on him (or more likely grampa) and his money, instead of being successful on my own. He became afraid I would be a \"failure\" like him, that still needs his dad to bail him out. So he started getting parenting advice from his in laws.\n\nWhy not ask his own dad, who\'s much much more successful and raised 3/4 of his kids to be successful as well? I asked. And apparently, it’s because he felt embarrassed (That comes up again and again and again to explain dad\'s action. Embarrassment). He didn\'t want grampa to think even less of him.\n\nTherefore the rent idea which was a suggestion from Laby. Dad says his initial plan was to save the money and give it to me later. But with a new kid, Steh not working, and trying to project to Steh and his in laws how things were fine, saving the money became impossible according to him. BTW, he also lied to me here at the time, saying it\'s a normal thing to do, that grampa had done it to him and his kids. Which is a lie I discovered 8 months ago, but with everything else that happened that seemed small at the time.\n\nThere\'s a detail that I didn\'t disclose in my previous posts because it didn\'t matter, or so I thought. And that is I\'m part of the LGBTQIA+ community. I don\'t hide this fact, in fact I was already out to my mom before her passing. But it\'s not something I advertise either. That\'ll become relevant later.\n\nAnyways, continuing...\n\nLaby becomes dad\'s confidant, and he starts to open himself to him about his money troubles, and Laby start to say things like I\'m should move out, and things like that to dad, which is rejected initially. Then Steh becomes pregnant again... and dad panics.\n\nThat\'s when Laby and Ebby come to dad, and say they would help him, not only financially, but Ebby would move in with him and Steh after the baby to help out, and even convince Steh to go back to work, since Ebby would be there taking care of the kids. But for that I needed to move out. Their reason is because the home wouldn\'t be able to accommodate Ebby, and that it was time I left the nest, etc... etc... etc. So they convinced dad I needed to move out.\n\nDad didn\'t tell Steh any of this, keep in mind. Only that he thought it was the best for me, and the baby coming was just a great opportunity. According to them, Steh was against this, but dad pulled the \"My daughter, I know best\" card, so she deferred to him.\n\nThey tell me I need to move out, I talked about this from my point of view. That day grampa goes to my dad\'s home and they have a huge fight. Not only dad and grampa, but dad and Steh. Because it was then she discovered dad didn\'t own the house, dad had almost no savings, and dad was dependent on grampa. Dad\'s deal with her parents was still a secret.\n\nAt this point I asked Steh, why then she acted so hostile towards me after that day, so much that made me unwelcomed and wanting to move out. And she looked shocked. She apologized to me and started to cry... saying that she was never mad at me, but at dad. That she had no idea she was to blame for me moving out. (I was crying as well, I said it\'s not her fault)\n\nAnd guys... I know many of you have said bad things about her, and I don\'t blame you. But I do believe her. The look on her face when I said I felt unwelcome and that’s why I moved out…, it\'s not something you can fake. Now I’m thinking she\'s as much of a victim of my dad\'s actions as me. And all this time she was just trying to give me space.\n\nSo going back to events, I move out, grampa not only cuts dad from all financial support, but starts to charge him money for the house. The only thing he continued paying for is Cassie\'s education.\n\nNow everything is in the open, and Dad and Steh have to cut everything. Dinners, expensive foods, sell her car, etc. Laby and Ebby give them some money as well to help out.\n\nPoor Steh is stressed out, pregnant, with a lying husband. I\'m actually sad for her and what she went through. I was looking at grampa, and I could see he was as well. I don\'t think he realized the amount of stress he was placing on her. (I don\'t know how he will proceed from now on regarding dad and the house)\n\nBefore the baby is born, Ebby moves in with dad and Steh, Steh gives birth, things are “normal”. But with the new baby, dad feels even more guilty over what happened, and that when he calls me.\n\nAgain this part I already told you... jumping to when I went to dinner the first time. Dad and Steh also recognize Ebby acting strange towards me. After I left they talked, nothing came from it.\n\nBut Steh kept talking to dad about her mom. And dad started to tell her his conversations with Ebby and Laby, about money and raising kids, etc. After my second dinner. Steh confronted her mom, and they had a huge fight. An apparently that\'s when she said something in the lines of \"I can\'t believe you\'re letting that [slur] back into your home after getting rid of her\"\n\nAnd that\'s when the coin dropped for dad, and he realized how much of a fool he has been. They kicked Ebby out, Laby came to pick her up and they had another fight.\n\nDad actually wanted to act as nothing had happened. Continue with me visiting, and rebuilding the relationship. But Steh put her foot down and said he needed to come clean, about everything, not only to me but Cassie, and everyone as well.\n\nAnd so we came to the present. I was crying, Steh was crying, Cassie was crying, Dad was crying, Aunt was crying, Grampa was crying, Gramma who hadn\'t said a single word was holding me tight.\n\nAccording to dad, that\'s all. No more lies, no more deception. Dad and Steh left after that. I sleeped at grampa\'s because I was in no state to drive.\n\nCame home this morning, took a fucking long shower. Cried a lot. And now I\'m typing this out to see if it helps me make sense of all of this. Make sense of my thoughts and feelings.\n\nI guess that\'s the end of the story. I don\'t know what I\'m gonna do now. I feel sad, angry, sorry for Steh and Cassie. I feel everything and nothing.\n\nI\'ll be calling my therapist tomorrow to see if we can book more sessions. I\'ve been going every friday, but I can\'t wait a whole week. On the bright side, whoever had bet \"Evil step-grandmother\", won.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/u/Zestyclose-Charge281/s/6ZlyP7iPQY): **September 16, 2025 (14 months later from the previous update)**\n\n[FINAL UPDATE] Grampa is \"punishing\" my dad. I have the power to stop it, but don\'t know if I actually want to.\n\nHi everyone, I was recently thinking of this post and decided to give an update. I wished I could’ve made on the /r/TrueOffMyChest but alas can’t. \n\nFirst I’m in a much better place emotionally, as last year I was a complete wreck. I’m doing very well for the most part.\n\nFor those who don’t remember or do not want to read [my previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1dn4jok/grampa_is_punishing_my_dad_i_have_the_power_to/), the summary is: My father forced me to move out, grandpa was mad at him and cut off his financial assistance that no one knew about, including my stepmom. Stepmom parents “manipulated” my father into kicking me out, because I’m trans, in exchange for their financial support.\n\n\\----\n\nNow… after everything hit the fan that day, life went back to normal more or less. We started family therapy for a while. It started promising, with dad being willing and open. But after a while he regressed and became less willing to put on the work until he stopped going. Me, Cassie, Stepmom continue going for a while, but stopped as well. I continue with individual therapy, and my psychiatrist wants to make an evaluation for ADHD, but wants to wait until I’m fully emotionally and physiologically stable. Stepmom and Cassie continue individual therapy as well.\n\nAs I imagine most could guess, Stepmom and Dad ended up separating after a few months, at first it was temporary, but now there’s no going back. Divorce is not finalized yet however.\n\nStepmom stayed on the house as grandpa would not accept anything else. I started going there to help stepmom with the baby and my little brother more and more, until I was spending almost all time there, so me and Stepmom decided I would move back. I thought Grandpa would be disappointed, as he was very proud of how well I was doing on my own, but he looked happy when I told him. But he said he’ll keep that unit a little longer out of the market if I ever need it.\n\nI continue going to uni, but took only a half load of classes this last year. But now I’m back to a full schedule. (Fluid Mechanics is a pain)\n\nHome life has actually been pretty good. Me and Stepmom became really really close this last year. She went back to work, while I left mine to help with the kids. (And I truly prefer this as taking care of my siblings is much more enjoyable) But also grandpa insisted on paying me to babysit. But next year I’ll start interning on a construction company from my grandpa’s friend.\n\nI know many people insisted my Stepmom knew everything, or was somewhat complacent with dad’s actions. But I truly truly believe and trust her. She’s being almost no contact with her parents, and they are forbidden to visit.\n\nCassie also stepped in and is helping a lot around the house, and grandpa also insists on paying her for her time. We know this is his way of helping us without making it sound too much like charity.\n\nMy baby sister is a little devil. Running all over the house. The little Lucifer, or Lucy as I call her, (that’s not her name, but I do actually call her Lucy sometimes) didn’t even learned to craw properly, she went directly to walking. We need to keep constant vigilance because it seems her head has a magnetic pull towards sharp corners. \n\nMy little brother was the one hit the hardest by dad moving out. I know these posts have painted a terrible picture of my father, and I’m not excusing anything he did, but he was a good dad otherwise, and my little brother was very attached to him.\n\nMe and my father barely speak nowadays. He acts like we should all forget everything and move on, which I [still?] cannot do. There’s no formal custody agreement between him and Stepmom, but he picks my brother twice or twice a month to spend the day or weekends. And now that my sister is older her sometimes too.\n\n\\----\n\nOverall I’m in a much much better place than I was last year. I have an incredible family, amazing grandparents, loving siblings, and my stepmom has become a really close friend. I even got a girlfriend. 🥰.\n\nI also know I’m extremely privileged to have a supportive family and system. In no moment in all of this, have I ever had to worry about having a roof over my head or food on the table, which unfortunately is not everyone’s experiences in similar situations, as I’ve been told [sometimes harshly] over private messages.\n\nLastly I’d like to thank everyone who read or commented something, the support on my first post was the push I needed to stop being naïve and ignore things.\n\nPosting here was a great way to help me to figure it out my thoughts and feelings. But I probably won’t do any more updates, as I consider this chapter of my life closed now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o1w8a0/final_new_update_grampa_is_punishing_my_dad_i/', 3865, 413, '2025-10-09 10:00:25', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

She posted in r/AmItheAsshole\n\n# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest update is 7 days old.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** &gt;!happy ending!&lt;\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o877ee/aita_for_being_annoyed_over_a_cabana/)**: October 16, 2025**\n\nSo I(F35) am currently on holiday at a resort with my friend(F35) who I love dearly.\n\nAt the hotel, there are a few coveted cabanas that are first come, first served. This morning I got up early and forewent breakfast, hoping to get one for us. All already were “reserved” with towels. The pool manager comes and I ask him about it, because they have signs all over that if the cabana is unoccupied for more than 30 mins, they will remove your stuff so someone else can use it.\n\nThe manager tells me everyone came down at 6am, put down their towels and went back to bed. It is around 8 so I ask him if that means they should be free now, because of the 30 min rule. He agrees and frees one up for us. I lie down, my friend joins me and I tell her the story, we agree that should someone come and try to claim it, we will show them the sign and point them to the manager.\n\nAn hour later, a woman comes up and says we’re in her cabana. I tell her that the manager freed it up for us because of the 30 min rule, but she calls the manager over, who tells us we can switch to the next one which has also now been empty for 3 hours. The woman says no, her friend is reserving that one. I am a bit annoyed at that point and say again, well there’s a rule and I don’t think it’s fair we have to move.\n\nMy friend then chimes in and says it’s fine we will leave. I accept, I don’t wanna argue further. We pack our stuff and then my friend walks up to the woman and apologises. She says the manager said it’s ok, we’re really sorry, we didn’t know it was occupied. The woman says it’s ok and shoots me a dirty look. My friend and I are now at a different spot with regular sun lounger and I’m trying to get back to regular happy holiday mood but I’m honestly hurt that she didn’t have my back.\n\nShe says I am ruining our vacation by being so silent and I get her point, but I’m trying really hard to not feel hurt. I feel she cared more about that lady she will never see again not being mad at her than supporting me. And even though it shouldn’t matter, it feels like I am the angry black lady while my (white) friend is “the good one”. On the other hand I understand it’s stupid to be mad about a thing with a fucking cabana.\n\nI know I will calm down in a bit, but AITA for needing some space and time to get over feeling unsupported?\n\nSorry that this was longer than I thought it would be!\n\n***Top Comment:***\n\n**Peaches\\_for\\_Me:** NTA. The hotel clearly has an issue with this happening or they wouldn\'t have the rule in place. The lady is TA for trying to pull this. Your friend is TA for giving in when the lady was clearly in the wrong.\n\nThat being said, I think you should speak to your friend and tell her you were hurt she didn\'t have your back.\n\nOnce you clear the air, drop it and enjoy the rest of your vacation!\n\n&gt;**Safford1958:** Nta, however some people are “peacemakers” anyways that is the kind name, the unkind name is “doormat”.  \nWe hate conflict and will usually give in when any disagreement comes up. How long are you willing to hold onto this grudge? Enough to ruin your vacation and friendship?\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update (Same Post): 11 hours later**\n\n**Edit:** Thought id give you a quick update. I am thankful for all your comments, I just read all of them.\n\nSo my friend and I talked it out, I told her I was hurt by her not having my back and she apologised and explained that this confrontation was just very uncomfortable for her (some of you clocked it, she is in general rather conflict-averse) and she would have much rather not been in the cabana than having to potentially deal with a guest. I told her I understand this, but I wished she had communicated this clearly to me, I would have left with her long before the lady came, because I think us enjoying the day is more important than having the softest bed around the pool. She understands why her apologising felt like throwing me under the bus.\n\nPlease don’t think of her as a bad friend from this one interaction, you are only getting my POV, and also she has been a great friend to me for 12 years and is amazing in many many ways. We go oN holiday together every year and this is the first time we had any “issue” with each other. So in summary, we are good and spent a nice day on the sun lounger.\n\nCrazy to me was, the cabana lady actually walked up to us around noon and apologised! She said she hadn’t known about the rule, apologised for how angry she was and said she should have handled it better. She then came up again, later, and told us a cabana just freed up and they’re holding it for us. We told her no need, thanks, but that it’s really sweet of her. So sometimes people can really surprise you and I am very happy about how the rest of the day went.\n\nSo thanks, reddit, I’ll toast to you with my next cocktail!', 'LucyAriaRose', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1odtyqc/aita_for_being_annoyed_over_a_cabana/', 3834, 201, '2025-10-23 10:26:58', '2025-11-07 23:43:29');

We\'re both on the lease, but I paid the deposit, move-in costs, and pay roughly 75% of all living expenses.\n\nYes, I know this is dumb. My friend doesn\'t make much money and was in a bad situation, and she couldn\'t live here without being on the lease. We\'ve lived together for almost three years and it\'s been fantastic. I had moved to a new city and she knew lots of people and has helped me establish a social life. I had no problem with the arrangement until now.\n\nShe recently suddenly and tragically lost her dog - who was like a child to her - and has been spiralling ever since. Drunk all the time, starting fights and hurling insults, etc. We had basically stopped talking when, about a month ago, she met some random guy. I don\'t know much about him, but what I\'ve seen isn\'t great.\n\nTwo weeks ago she got a DUI and this guy bailed her out. The next day he came back to our house with her and spent much of the day. He then started coming here every day, taking up the living room, walking around with no shirt on, etc. I avoided them as much as I could and we never exchanged words. The guy gives me the creeps. He\'s large, maybe 6\'4\" and on the heavier side. And his vibe is just, I dunno. Off.\n\nSix days ago the guy spent the night here. Then he stayed over the next night. Then the next night. The following morning I told my roommate that it\'s not cool to be taking up the house and having her boyfriend stay over for long stretches. I told her he made me uncomfortable, and she basically said it\'s her boyfriend and her house and she can do what she wanted.\n\nOn the fifth morning, yesterday, I saw that he had toiletries in our bathroom. I told my roommate it seemed like her boyfriend is attempting to stay here long-term, and pointed out that our lease has limits on guests staying over (14 nights in a six-month period).\n\nThis is where things changed, and where I need advice. My roommate has now started to say things like \"I feel threatened\" and \"I feel unsafe\" and \"I need my boyfriend here for protection.\" There\'s no truth to them at all - I\'ve been leaving the house every evening after work and only coming home around 11 or 12, and I completely avoid all contact with both of them. The only contact we\'ve ever had was one evening when I came home around 11, and they were smoking weed on our front porch. He was once again basically in his underwear, and asked him to please wear clothes when he\'s in the common areas of the house. That\'s also I\'ve ever said to him.\n\nIt seems like she\'s using this as some kind of legal/defense strategy, and planning to tell our agent and owners that I\'m some kind of danger to her and she needs her boyfriend here for protection when they tell her he needs to go.\n\nYesterday her boyfriend showed up at 4pm, while I was still working from home, and spent the rest of the day and night here. He\'s literally waking up, going to work, and coming back to our home. He\'s living here.\n\nSo I got curious. Last night when I got home I looked through the window into his SUV. It\'s filled - I mean FILLED - with clothes and hangers. It looks exactly like a car that someone is living out of.\n\nMaybe I\'m being crazy, but it seems like this dude is homeless and is manipulating my roommate into moving into our house. Her shift in language - all the talk about threats and protection - isn\'t like her, and it\'s completely divorced from reality. It seems like she\'s being coached.\n\nI\'ve spoken with our agent, who I\'m friendly with, and she\'s aware of the situation. She\'s seen the guy\'s car here every day and will be messaging my roommate about the guest rules today.\n\nMy concern is that my roommate is going to start lying and accusing me of making *her* feel unsafe, telling the agent that she needs her boyfriend here for protection. I\'m not super concerned that it\'s going to work, but I am concerned that the agent and owners are going to look at this situation and decide it\'s not worth it and just cancel the lease. I really, really like this house and don\'t want to have to move.\n\nI\'ve already changed the WiFi password (I pay all utilities) and locked up all of possessions, which include plates, cookware, and all silverware. I\'m just out of options at this point and wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation.\n\n**Edit:** I should mention that the agent is basically our landlord. It\'s a direct home rental from the owners, and she is the middleman who handles all renter issues.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I’d immediately demand the rent split to go back to 50/50 at the very least if he’s going to stay there. You’re literally subsidizing housing for 2 people. They can’t make their half of the rent between the 2 of them?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I did. I sent her an email when we first stopped talking explaining that she\'s going to be responsible for 50%. I attached all of our utility bills and gave her a total due on the first.\n&gt; \n&gt; She\'s made it clear she\'s not going to pay it, but I have documentation. I could take her to small claims court eventually, but for now I\'m worried about getting this guy out.\n\n**Commenter 2:** You need to tell your roommate that it\'s time for her to move along. This has gone past the point where you could repair the situation without kicking her out.\n\nI would also tell her the guy needs to be gone immediately or you will get the police involved. Ignore her arguments.  You are the one that doesn\'t feel safe and that\'s all the justification you need.\n\nLet your landlord know that you would like to stay on and are looking for a new roommate. You are risking losing the place but that\'s a risk if you don\'t do anything as well. Chances are if you\'ve been a good tenant, your landlord will work with you to get your roommate out and allow you to keep living there.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I\'ve told her to leave numerous times. She refuses. She says she\'s on the lease and this is her house. The landlord is going to have to force her out or I\'m going to have to break the lease, which I don\'t want to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; The guy is still technically not violating the law. She\'s inviting him here. Can\'t call the cops. Plus police activity at the home will basically guarantee that I\'m getting kicked out too.\n\n**Commenter 3:** You need to tell the landlord NOW. Do NOT let this guy get tenant rights because then all of you will go through eviction.\n\nNot to mention him being over can potentially mean you’re violating the lease and get you evicted.\n\nSTOP PAYING HER FUCKING SHARE. GET A BACKBONE. ENOUGH. You need to document everything\n\nIf you are in a one party consent state always have your phone. To record\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It\'s two party consent here unfortunately. I\'m documenting everything through texts, but now she\'s saying that the texts are \"harassment.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; I informed her the payment arrangement has changed and she\'s responsible for 50% moving forward. I emailed her the bills and an invoice. She won\'t pay it but I could eventually take her to small claims if I wanted.\n\n**Commenter 4:** I don\'t think the guy can get tenants\' rights unless he were to start having mail delivered in his name to that address, which I suppose is a real possibility given how selfish and deranged OP\'s roommate sounds.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Even then he\'s a long way from having rights. Tenant law in Florida is heavily weighted toward landlords.\n\n**OOP should break the lease and look for a new place if it\'s possible**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It took me a long time to find this house and I\'ve only been in it for two months. I dropped $6k to move in and will lose a ton by breaking the lease. I don\'t have another $6k to move to a new house, so I\'d be looking at voluntarily losing thousands of dollars just to move from a nice home into a shitty apartment. That\'s my last resort at this point.\n\n**Can OOP reach out to his roommate\'s family or friends regarding her wellbeing?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I wish. She has no family and has alienated her other close friends already. This guy is basically all she has now.\n\n**OOP\'s state and the tenants\' rules on guests staying overnight** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** Florida. The landlord filled me in - the 14 day in six months restriction is designed for that scenario.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/Y2AO0RWT42): **October 14, 2025 (two months later)**\n\nCondensed version: I (m) have lived with a long-time friend (f) for about three years, after moving to a new city. I paid most of the bills to help her out, and in turn she introduced me to a ton of new people and helped me build a social life. It was great. This summer we moved from an apartment to a direct home rental.\n\nJust as we were moving, her dog died unexpectedly and tragically, and it broke her. She started seeing this weird guy and shortly thereafter got a DUI. He bailed her out, and suddenly started basically living at our house. He had a toothbrush in the bathroom, clothes in the house, etc. He\'d be here with her from 3pm on, stay over, shower here, leave in the morning, and come right back. They also trashed the kitchen and bathroom on a daily basis, forcing me to clean up after them just to be able to cook and shower. I was begging her to stop but she refused and our friendship collapsed. Things became extremely antagonistic.\n\nOur landlord - who lives next door - repeatedly reminded her that our lease prohibits guests from staying over more than 14 times in a six-month period. My roommate started lying, saying that she didn\'t feel safe around me and needed him here for \"protection.\" Then I noticed his car was filled with clothes - dozens and dozens of hangers with shirts, pants, shoes, etc - and it became clear he was never actually going to another home. He was just living here.\n\nUnfortunately we never had a signed rental agreement between us, so I was stuck paying 75% of the bills while she and her boyfriend basically took over the house. She made it clear she was not going to leave or break the lease (she knew neither of them could get a place on their own) and I didn\'t know what to do. I changed the WiFi password, locked up all the pots/pans/dishes (they were all mine), hid all of my laundry detergent and dryer sheets, etc. They had no TV, no internet, and were using a cheap, $3 saute pan and paper plates to cook with, but they kept on living here.\n\nLuckily, I\'ve been friends with our landlord since we moved in and she was just as upset with him living at the house as I was. So she sent my roommate a formal notification that, if the boyfriend stayed over beyond 14 days, they would evict us. My roommate said she understood and that he would be gone after the 14th day. But, sure enough, on day 15 he was right back at the house. We had a confrontation (which I filmed) and her boyfriend charged at me and tried to attack me, but my roommate held him back. I was actually kind of hoping he would hit me so I could get the cops involved, but he just stormed out and slammed our door. I spoke with a cop friend and she told me it unfortunately wasn\'t enough to seek a protection order.\n\nAfter that he stopped staying over but continued to basically live at our house, arriving around 3pm and leaving at 11 or 12. I was miserable, and basically just accepted the fact that this would be my life until the lease ended next summer.\n\nBut two weeks ago I finally caught a break. She fucked up and had her boyfriend stay over again. I documented it and sent proof to the landlord, and she texted me back saying \"Woohoo! You\'re free.\"\n\nAn hour later she sent both of us a notice of eviction, instructing us that we both had to be out by the end of October. My roommate and I happened to be at the same sports bar (a huge multi-story place with dozens of mutual friends) when the notice came in, and she came upstairs screaming at me, cursing me off and telling everyone that *I* had gotten us evicted because I \"went whining to the landlord.\"\n\nShe and her boyfriend left and went to the landlord\'s house, freaking out and saying that she\'s gonna be homeless and won\'t be able to rent a place with an eviction on her record. She actually tried to convince the landlord to just evict me and let her boyfriend move in instead, saying that I was the one causing all the problems. The landlord said no dice, but told her she could avoid the eviction if she agreed to break the lease, move out at the end of the month, and didn\'t have her boyfriend over at all in the meantime. If he showed up, the landlord said she would immediately send a seven-day eviction notice and we\'d be out within a week.\n\nAfter that my roommate and her boyfriend basically disappeared. I think at first she might have thought that if they stayed away for a bit things might cool down and he could start coming to the house again. But at some point something must have changed - either they realized there was no path forward or they found someone else to stay with. I don\'t really know. But about a week ago they came to the house and started packing up some of her stuff from the garage. And yesterday my landlord said my roommate had agreed to break the lease at the end of the month. I just signed a new lease today, and will officially have my home back on Nov. 1.\n\nNot sure what the lesson is... Definitely be cool with your landlord, and always *always* sign a separate rental agreement with your roommate(s) before you enter into a lease together.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** This was a long time friend or just 3 years? It’s really sad that the friendship just went to shit. Did you ever have like a heart to heart before things got as bad as they did to see why the sudden changes in how she was treating you? I know it sucks losing a pet but throwing away a long term friendship over it is odd\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We\'ve been friends for many years. We had one period after moving in where we had a heart to heart and she agreed to start being more respectful. It lasted for two days.\n&gt; \n&gt; It may have started with her dog but it became all about the boyfriend. It\'s one of those high school, co-dependent, us against the world kind of relationships. She lost her license so she spends literally - literally - every free minute of every single day with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; She\'s now extremely self-centered, mean, disrespectful, and completely lost to the world. It\'s really sad, but she\'s not the girl I knew anymore.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 2:** Drugs. She’s on drugs.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Just weed and booze. But they\'re the kind of people who give weed a bad name. Full on space cadets.\n\n**OOP on his friend and her boyfriend\'s behaviors and ages**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Not really. It\'s just me saying \"we\'re going to get evicted\" and \"he needs to leave\" over and over again, while they act like teenagers. They\'re in their mid 30s\n\n+\n\n&gt; No joke. It really seemed like he was trying to establish residency here. When he met my landlord for the first time he actually hugged her, and put on the most obvious, fake charm act imaginable.\n&gt; \n&gt; She called me afterwards and was like, \"Does he think I\'m stupid? He really thought I\'d buy that. He\'s so weird.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Both of them thought they could hug their way into taking over the lease.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Glad they\'re getting out. Now have your landlord change the locks the minute the end of the month happens. Your (ex) friend did you wrong in so many ways. Sorry, I know how it feels.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thanks for saying that. Honestly. I know I\'m making light of it but the past two months have been hell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oc30qx/roommate_moved_her_possibly_homeless_boyfriend/', 3662, 264, '2025-10-21 10:00:09', '2025-11-07 23:43:29'),

I apologize for any errors in my English as it\'s not my first language.\n\nI (29M) and my wife (30F) have 2 kids (5M, 3M). My wife works a full time office job, while I work from home with extremely flexible hours (basically as long as I meet my deadlines no one really cares how many hours it took or what time of day I work outside of some zoom meetings). My sister (26F), let\'s call her Barb, and her husband (30M), let\'s call him Nick, live nearby and work full time jobs. They have a daughter (5F), let\'s call her Tracy.\n\nBecause of my comfortable work schedule, when our kids started going to daycare, we basically decided that I\'ll be dropping off and picking up my niece from daycare alongside my own kids. I didn\'t really mind and I thought it was great for my kids to spend time with their cousin. I get along with Tracy as well, and always thought I was her cool uncle. She\'s a sweet kid and usually well behaved. So anyway most days I bring her and my kids back to our house, I make them snacks or dinner, and in the afternoon/evening my sister comes to pick them up.\n\nA few days ago the 5yo kids were watching Bluey on the TV as I was preparing snacks with my 3yo and I suddenly heard yelling. I rushed over to see what\'s up and my son was yelling at her that \"My dad\'s not a girl!!\" while my niece yells back \"He is! He\'s a f\\*\\*\\*\\*t! That\'s like a girl!!\" (the word is different in my language but the meaning holds, as is the distinction between using it vs. simply addressing a gay person). I\'m kind of in shock at first, but I turned off the TV, and I sat her down and began explaining that this is a very bad word and we shouldn\'t be calling people that, and that regardless, I\'m not a girl. And because this is a bad word she should apologize to me because we don\'t act mean to each other in this family, and if I hear this again I\'m going to talk to her parents and she\'s going get in trouble.\n\nShe said she won\'t get in trouble because that\'s what her dad called me, and he\'s not in trouble. I was stunned. I told her that regardless of what her dad said, it\'s a very bad word and she\'s not to use it with me or in my presence, and that she should apologize regardless because it hurt my feelings, which she did, because she\'s a really good kid. We talked some more and I prodded her about other things her parents said, and from what I gather (getting info out of a 5 year old being obviously a difficult and unreliable process) Nick, my BIL, told my sister in Tracy\'s presence that men shouldn\'t be sitting at home all day and doing childcare, that cooking is a woman\'s duty, as is cleaning and really most of the things I do around my house. And that I\'m a girl (I interpret this as \'not really a man\') because I do housework and my wife earns more money than me. I explained to her the best I could that men and woman could work from an office or from home, and that my wife or Barb working long hours from the office doesn\'t make them men, and vice versa, but I didn\'t dwell on it with her since it\'s not really her fault.\n\nI didn\'t immediately bring it up with my sister because I figured it would be a difficult conversation and I didn\'t want to have it in front of the kids, and I wanted to talk it out with my wife first as well. I did talk to my wife that evening and she seemed really upset as well. I told her that I think I should demand an apology from Nick and my sister, and she agreed. I called my sister and told her what happened, and she said that it\'s just a word and I\'m blowing it out of proportion, and obviously Nick doesn\'t dislike me. I said I don\'t care whether he does or doesn\'t dislike me, he is talking shit about me behind my back to my niece and to her, and she is apparently very chill about this, rather than standing up for me. She said that was how Nick was, and I should stop being a drama queen. I told her to fuck off and if that was how she felt she could pick up her own child from daycare, and hung up.\n\nI know it was really short notice and rude, but I really felt like I was being disrespected by people I did so much for over the years, and were my family. My wife said she understood, and that I shouldn\'t back down until I at least get a proper apology.\n\nThe next 2 days were a weekend and there was no daycare. I assumed there would be calls or texts from Barb, but there was nothing. In fact, the suspicious lack of any messages or calls made me think she didn\'t take my words seriously, and this actually got me even more angry. The calls did come when it was time to pick up Tracy for daycare and I (obviously) didn\'t come. I dropped my own kids off, and didn\'t even answer for a while. I know it was petty but I was stewing for two days and figured letting Barb stew for a few hours seemed really appropriate and felt really good. Around noon when she called again I did pick up. I was going to smugly tell her that I was ready for my apology, and we would put it behind us, but I didn\'t get to. Instead – she went off on me, about how I was irresponsible and I flaked, and she was so late for work because of me, to which I just said \"I told you I wasn\'t going to pick her up. You had two days to make arrangements.\" And she kept yelling at me, so I hung up again. She kept calling and sending me texts about picking Tracy up from daycare, to which I said I will not be, then stopped replying.\n\nWhen I came to pick my kids up, Tracy was expecting me to take her as well, and I didn\'t which was very rough on me and her both. Like, I know it\'s not her fault and she\'s 5, and she suddenly doesn\'t get to go over to our place and play and have snacks, but at the same time – I didn\'t want to just let this thing go. I felt like I deserved an apology (and still do), so I explained that me and her mom were fighting, but I\'ll pick her up again when we work it out. She obviously didn\'t take it well (because she\'s 5), but I apologized, took my kids and left.\n\nWell a bit later I got a call from my mom – Barb roped her into picking up Tracy, but my mom is disabled, so she was having a really hard time with Tracy, and asked me why I was being mean to Barb. I told her everything, expecting her to take my side, but instead she also pulled a \"you know how Nick is\", to which I replied that the more I realize how Nick is the less I like it, and if he thinks all this shit in general and about me specifically, I sure as fuck ain\'t going to be doing free labor for him. She said I was blowing this all out of proportion, and I told her I wasn\'t the one doing it, because all I asked for was a fucking apology, and everyone else seemed to prefer all of this shit to just giving it to me, to which she said I should just be the bigger man and not let it get to me, to which I said I was done and to have fun with Tracy.\n\nThat evening I got a call from Nick himself, which I was hesitant about, but chose to answer on the off chance that I was actually about to get that apology. Nope. Apparently my behavior is causing Barb great distress and we\'re family and how can I do this to my own sister. I told him that since we\'re family – how can he talk shit about me to his kid which I take care of daily, and he said he was only joking, and it was all in good fun. I told him it was neither good nor fun for me, and I want my apology. He blew up on me, telling me I was a f\\*\\*\\*\\*t and couldn\'t take a joke, and called me a hysterical little girl. I told him to fuck off and that I was done with him and hung up. This led to a bunch of calls from Barb &amp; my mom which I didn\'t answer. Barb texted me that it wasn\'t fair for Tracy to pay the price for me being petty, and I told her that it wasn\'t fair for Tracy to pay the price of her parents being ungrateful pieces of shit, to which she just text-yelled at me a bunch about how she was going to lose her job and I was being cruel to her and to mom. I told her I was done and unless her next message was an apology I will be blocking her number, and it wasn\'t – so now I blocked her.\n\nPast few days my mom\'s been picking up Tracy and it\'s been really rough seeing her in daycare and explaining that grandma\'s going to pick her up, which she hates, and tells me she isn\'t having fun with grandma and wants to come over to our place, and it\'s breaking my heart, but at the same time – I never got a single apology from anyone but the 5yo, and I feel like letting this go would just be telling my family that it\'s okay to ignore my boundaries. But at the same time I do love my niece and I don\'t want to traumatize her or have her resent me. She is a good kid and none of it is her fault. So… AITAH? And… What do I do?\n\n**-- Edit *\\[same post\\]*:** Holy shit you guys. Post barely been up 4 hours and I am already so grateful for all your support and advice!\n\nThe angle of Nick actually wanting Barb to quit her job is not one I considered but now I think it might actually have merit, and it makes me very worried for her.\n\nAt the same time I can\'t really do much until she at least acknowledges that \"that\'s just how Nick is so stop overreacting\" isn\'t going to fly with me. I also assume it\'s only a matter of time until my mom is no longer an option (she\'s already having a hard time) so I hope I get a chance to talk to her about it - ideally because she sees my point of view, but I\'ll settle for because she\'s desperate (I don\'t know what sort of childcare they\'ll be able to afford - they took out a large mortgage on a house they can barely afford).\n\nI will also make certain to stress upon Tracy that I love her and none of this is her fault. Thank you all!\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS:**\n\n&gt;nta. Nick is always the asshole so people are used to putting up with him. you standing up to him and making him responsible for his actions is breaking the status quo. they would rather tell you to help stabilize the boat than tell Nick to stop rocking it because it\'s easier to bully a nice person than it is to change a bad person.\n\n**\\[There is no consensus on** r/AITAH, **but OOP was NTA\\]**\n\n**Update: AITAH for refusing to take care of my niece after she called me a slur?** \\[*One Day Later - November 13th, 2024*\\]\n\nAlright, so I posted this yesterday, and was genuinely overwhelmed by the comments, advice and support. I\'d like to than everyone for it, and feel this warrants an update.\n\nJust to clarify a few things:\n\nMy dad died from a heart attack two years ago, which came as no surprise because he smoked a lot and lived a pretty unhealthy life, so we weren\'t really surprised - it wasn\'t his first either. He was a great grandpa and a great dad before that and right up to the end. But his death left my mom alone and she doesn\'t work.\n\nMy mom has MS, which is basically mostly steady, but slowly gets worse over time and flares up occasionally, and is made worse by stress, which my mom goes through now. A flare up often means the level she gets back to isn\'t quite what it was before, so we mostly try to keep her stress free. My dad had life insurance so her house is paid for and she had a little money, but there\'s also a caretaker coming over 3 times a week to clean, cook, do shopping etc, which she can\'t afford so me and my wife pay for.\n\nAs I mentioned in a comment on the original post - me and my wife are doing probably better off financially then Barb &amp; Bill. they have a fancy house and fancy cars but they have a mortgage and loans.\n\nSo, the great response I got made me think about this shit again, and I thought how I could stand my ground without giving up on Tracy altogether, and figured there was no perfect solution, and I had to settle on \\*something\\*.\n\nI took the day off work because I just needed to process and deal with this shit.\n\nOne comment on the original post really got to me - about how someone would feel in Tracy\'s place, and I just can\'t do it to her now. I know this isn\'t the update some of you have wanted, but I just can\'t. I love her like she was one of my own, and my kids do as well, and it\'s not her fault.\n\nI unblocked my sister because obviously if I\'m going to be interacting with her child, she needs to be able to reach me.\n\nI talked to my mom during the day and she was (Again) distraught about having to pick Tracy up, which is pretty hard on her. I told her I was willing to do it, but I\'m coming over and she\'s going to have to hear me out, to which she agreed. I talked to her for a long time, avoiding snark and lashing out this time, and just explaining that basically how serious Nick was or how he is doesn\'t matter. I used that rocking the boat analogy someone linked to in comments, and further stressed my point by saying that it shouldn\'t matter if I was justified or not in getting upset, I am her child and if something upset me it at least warrants giving me the benefit of the doubt before siding against me, and eventually it seemed to come through. She apologized and we hugged it out, and I think she got it. She\'s not a very confrontational person and generally really tries to keep the peace and this time she went about it wrong. I\'m not saying I\'m not mad, but she\'s my mom and she apologized. I explained to her that she shouldn\'t be covering for me because that means I have no leg to stand on when confronting Nick and Barb, and she was receptive to it.\n\nI texted my sister that we needed to talk and I\'ll drop Tracy off at their place tonight, to which I got a stoic thumbs up. I picked Tracy up from daycare today and she was overjoyed. she was actually a little possessive of me, staying by my side all afternoon instead of running off to play, which was cute but also made me feel like shit a little, because that\'s impact me not picking her up. I explained to the best of my ability that she\'s not in trouble and I\'m not angry with her, but I \\*am\\* angry with her parents and we need to work that out, but I\'ll do my best to not stop picking her up anymore, which she was really happy about.\n\nI dropped her off in the evening and once she was in bed I sat down to talk with Barb and Nick. I told them flat out that mom wasn\'t going to be covering for them anymore, and if they didn\'t let me finish what I had to say, I would get up and leave, and they can find new arrangements for Tracy (didn\'t mean it but they don\'t need to know that). they weren\'t happy but they were willing to listen, so that\'s progress, or at least the threat working. I explained that this was the situation now - I don\'t need them to mean their apology, but I sure as fuck was going to need one. This was principle now. I have spent \\*years\\* taking care of their child, and if they wanted to be assholes, I wasn\'t going to do it for free. So this was how it goes now:\n\nI am no longer going to be dropping her off in the morning until further notice. there was no excuse for the way Nick acted and it needed to have \\*some\\* lasting impact.\n\nI was no longer going to be paying for family outings and family vacations. It was a man\'s job to support his family, so good luck with that. The exception is Tracy - who is always welcome.\n\nIf I hear anymore BS being talked about me behind my back, I was going to start charging them from my service.\n\nMy plan was to dangle the thing they want - childcare. Restoring it, but at the same time giving \\*some\\* repercussions and threat of things getting hard for them again. I also laid it on pretty thick about how I am a man so I obviously have my pride and can\'t have that be disrespected, even by my own family who I obviously love (don\'t really consider Nick family but figured he wouldn\'t figure that out). Nick was \\*not\\* happy about this, and my sister actually had to take him outside to talk it out without me, but eventually they did agree to it, and I got my (admittedly half-hearted) apology. I could probably press it further, but I didn\'t want to risk having to either back down or hurt Tracy again, so I took this.\n\nThere were no tears and no warm hugs, but I get to walk away with what I wanted - giving them some payback without having to give up my time with Tracy. I still plan to talk to my sister alone about her relationship with Nick and about how she sees me, but I figure I should let things calm down a bit before I do.\n\nI know this isn\'t the resolution some (maybe most) of you wanted, but at the end of the day I need to find a solution I can live with, and for me this is it. Will update if anything changes.\n\n**Update: AITAH for refusing to take care of my niece after she called me a slur?** \\[*Three Months Later - Wednesday, February 19th, 2025*\\]  \n(Thanks for suggesting the addition, u/Perfectmess92)\n\nThese past few months things have been tense, but… okay. I haven\'t gone back on my word about dropping her off, and haven\'t being paying for meals or anything, really. I also, having realized what sort of man Nick is, I\'ve been gently trying to get some alone time with my sister and ask her some questions about their relationship – has he been isolating her, is she financially dependent on him, can she go out with her friends, how jealous does he get. Some of her answers made me a little uncomfortable, but I can\'t really force her into anything. I\'m not trying to excuse the way she treated me, but also I think she\'s in a bad situation herself, and I don\'t want her to become more isolated than she is, so I\'m gently trying to guide her down the right path, dropping hints like \"isn\'t it like what your really bad ex used to do?\" and the like. I don\'t think she quite realizes how deep into this she is, but I also know from past experienced that forcing her into anything is really going to mostly cause her to pull away and become more stubborn, so I\'m trying to guide her to the right conclusion gently, while making sure she knows she has a place to go and someone to support her if she ever chooses to break things off.\n\nNick hasn\'t really been… anything with me. I don\'t think his feelings about me changed much, but he\'s basically avoiding interacting with me and \"has to work\" a lot when we get together as a family, which I think might be the best outcome for everyone involved. Tracy has been sweet. She\'s slowly learning to read alongside my oldest, and still enjoys bad words, we just use less mean bad words now. \"poop\" has been a hit. She\'s now a big fan of the Tom Cardy song \"Have you checked your Butthole.\" We\'ve been pretty good about making clear the difference between rude words and hurtful words.\n\nOver the holidays we went on a trip. At first Barb and Nick were probably shocked that I was serious when I said they were welcome to join us, but I wasn\'t paying for anyone but Tracy, if they choose to send her along. I talked it over with Barb, leaving it up to her how to convey that to Nick, who, as stated, was avoiding me. I assume he didn\'t take it well but I don\'t really have a way of knowing for sure. Barb, for her part tried doubling down, getting me to cave, but I stood my ground – I said I wasn\'t paying for things and I meant it. I explained, again, that this wasn\'t about a specific trip, but about the fact that I used to believe that they genuinely and unconditionally loved me, and that is just no longer the case. It\'s not something I can just unfeel. I need this to feel like I am standing up for myself and she can choose to respect my feelings and my decision or to be angry, but I won\'t back down on this, and the only choice that IS up to her is to come on her own dime or not to, and send Tracy along with us or not to if she chooses not to come. She ended up sending her along and we had a blast.\n\nMy wife seems much relieved to no longer have to put up with Nick as often. She apparently had him pegged from the get go, but wanted me to come to my own conclusions, and was hoping he wasn\'t as bad as he seemed to her initially. She\'s glad I\'m standing up for myself and is glad we still get to hang out with Tracy.\n\nI still hope someday Barb comes to her senses about her situation, and I will support her fully if she does, despite not quite being over what she either thought about me or at least didn\'t stand up for me to Nick about, but she\'s still my family. Regardless thank you to everyone for your support and advice!\n\n**---NEW UPDATE** \\[*Posted Eleven Months Later to r/TrueOffMyChest - Thursday, October 9th, 2025*\\] **---**\n\n**I\'m having a hard time being there for my sister after my mom\'s passing**\n\nI don\'t really know how to explain this frustration, really. It\'s not that she did anything wrong. She\'s not being rude or hurtful or anything, I\'m just really really tired. I feel like I\'m spread too thin and I don\'t have much left to give. It\'s all just too much...\n\nIt all started a few months back - my mom\'s health took a turn for the worst. She started some treatment which made her immune system go out of whack and unfortunately that caused an infection and she was just gone. It was a matter of weeks. One moment she was her usual self, then she had an MS flare-up and soon she was just gone. It was so sudden.\n\nAnd then before I really had time to deal with my feelings of that, my sister told me she was getting divorced. I don\'t blame my sister for that - the way her ex behaved regarding my mom\'s health and passing made it absolutely the right choice, but my sister just started depending on me so much for everything - emotional support, childcare, it was too much. I used to be able to be there for her all the time, but I just can\'t as much anymore. I have a job. I have my own children to deal with. I can\'t have a 2 hour phone call with her at 2am then get up and function all day like I could when I was 23.\n\nTo make things worse, her ex is making the divorce an absolute nightmare. He keeps making things up or randomly opposing previously agreed to terms, which my sister needs to deal with, which often involves turning to her lawyer, the social worker managing the case and sometimes a judge. It drains her time a resources, and then I have to shoulder some of that load as well. It gets absurd - at one point he used her spare key to her car to take his daughter\'s car seat. There was no reason to, as far as I can tell, except it being a gift from his mom or something and wanting to be petty. He just left her without one without telling her, which meant I had to be called to give her my spare. It was the pettiest shit in existence.\n\nThey\'re trying to sell their house, which they have to do to cover what I now know to be an absolutely unreasonable mortgage they took out to buy it, but this having to go through 2 levels of lawyers (the ones handling their divorce &amp; the one handling the property stuff) also makes it both cumbersome and exhausting.\n\nAnd I\'m just drained. I want to be there for my sister, and even more importantly - my niece, but I\'m just so tired all the time. I feel myself have less patience, become less fun with the kids. I hate that they\'re paying the price for what isn\'t their fault at all but I just don\'t know what to do. I considered therapy but I genuinely don\'t have the time. My wife\'s been a godsend, but her work is incredibly demanding and there\'s only so much she can reasonably do, and besides, these aren\'t really her monkeys. I can only reasonably burden her with so much. I\'m just drained.\n\nI don\'t know what to do really except soldier on. But it\'s just really hard right now.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**\n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Anonymotron42', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1onwg6y/aitah_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_niece_after/', 3537, 164, '2025-11-04 10:01:58', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

I’ve had her for two years and she’s changed my life. My roommate (19F) and I have lived together for six months with no issues.\n\nLast week she told me her boyfriend (30M) is moving in. I said okay, but asked that we all sit down to discuss house rules since it’s a big change. During that conversation, he said he’s “uncomfortable with dogs” and wants her crated whenever he’s home.\n\nI explained she’s a service dog, not a pet, and that she needs to be with me to do her job. He said he “gets that” but his comfort matters too since he’s paying rent. He suggested I could keep her in my bedroom only, but she needs to move freely to alert me wherever I am in the apartment.\n\nI said no, this is a medical accommodation, not a negotiation. Now my roommate is saying I’m being “inflexible” and “ruining her relationship” because her boyfriend is reconsidering moving in. She said I’m “choosing a dog over her happiness” and that I’m being selfish since “it’s her apartment too.”\n\nMy sister thinks I should just try to keep the dog in my room more often to “meet them halfway.” I told my roommate either the dog stays as is, or I’m moving out. Now she’s crying that I’m “abandoning” her and she can’t afford rent alone.\n\nAIO?\n\n*(editor\'s note: narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain\'s ability to control sleep-wake cycles)*\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NOR, it\'s illegal to separate you from a service animal. I had to stand my ground against my family for the same reason, only my dog senses my seizures before they hit.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Exactly!! No one understands that part. My dog doesnt bother anyone, shr barely even barks, and I always look after her. There shouldnt be an issue\n\n**Commenter 2:** Is he on the lease? If he’s not on the lease I would not agree to him being put on the lease or moving in. You might want to check your lease agreement and make sure there’s nothing about unauthorized long term stays from people as well - some leases have clauses like this and you’ll want to make sure you aren’t breaking the lease agreement by allowing him to move in.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I don’t want to be a rude roommate and snitch :/, she’s nice and we have handled everything verbally, if this continues, I will look into my lease. Thanks, I didn’t even think of that!!\n\n**Commenter 3:** Putting your health &amp; safety is non negotiable. Perhaps if he meets the dogs and watches how the dog interacts around the space/people he might be able to understand how the dog will be less concerned with him and more concerned about ensuring you’re well informed about your own health.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** When we sat down and talked, he told me he was once attacked by a group of dogs when he was younger. He’s been going to therapy recently to help overcome that fear and many other things, and he even cried when he as telling me the story. Regardless, my dog is soo sweet but I dont think letting him around my dog is the best decision anymore.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Please don’t let him move in / you’ll come home one day and your dog will be gone - “escaped” while you were out, sleeping or whatever.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That’s what I’m saying, he already showed dissatisfaction for my dog, what if he ends up doing something?? I just don’t want him there anymore\n\n**Commenter 5:** Stand your ground. NOR. If this guy doesn\'t move in it\'s probably better for you and your roommate.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I agree, I try my best to be a good roommate but another person in the house seems like a lot to deal with\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[My friend took me on a picnic and brought this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharcuterieBoard/comments/1ohwykw/my_friend_took_me_on_a_picnic_and_brought_this/): **October 27, 2025 (next day)**\n\n**Editor\'s note: OOP provided a picture of the charcuterie board.

(Part 2)\n\nFirst off, thank you guys for all the comments and advice on my last post. I appreciate everyone who told me to check my lease, stand my ground, and yes, even the people who said to call him a hobosexual (which I’m definitely not doing lol). Honestly, I did not expect things to turn out like this.\n\nI’ll link the previous post in the comments, for those interested.\n\nSo after our fight, my roommate asked if we could all have another talk at the apartment. I agreed, hoping it would ease up the tension since we still had to live together while I figured out my next steps.\n\nWe sat down in the living room. She immediately apologized for how everything went down and talked about how she’d been doing a lot of thinking about her relationship and living situation.\n\nAbout 5 minutes in, her boyfriend showed up with a bag of dog treats and a full charcuterie board. He sat down and immediately apologized.\n\nHe told me he’d talked about the entire situation in his therapy session, and it helped him realize how he was being completely unreasonable about the situation.\n\nHe said he’d been “selfish” and “ignorant” about what service animals actually do.\n\nHe said he would prefer to stay with her because he’s in the process of buying a home. He thinks it would take about 3-4 months before he can close on the house he wants, and doesnt want to renew his current lease for another full year.\n\nThen he said if he still moves in, he wants to pay half my rent AND cover all my dog’s food going forward. He called it “the least I can do for being an asshole about a disability accommodation.” My roommate nodded and said they’d discussed it and agreed. They both seemed genuinely sorry.\n\nI told him it’s something I need to think about. He said he completely understands, that he’s going to give us our space, and then he left.\n\nMy roommate and I decided to take the charcuterie board and go on a picnic for the day at a park nearby. We both agreed it was best for us to just enjoy our time together, and that I should sleep on it before I make any decisions. She said she wants me to be as comfortable as possible, which honestly made me feel a lot better.\n\nThe offer is REALLY generous. We’re talking like $600+ a month between the rent and dog expenses. But I keep thinking about whether this would last or if the complaints will start again once he’s settled in.\n\nMy sister (who told me to “compromise” before) now says I should take the deal because “free rent is free rent.” But my mom thinks it sounds too good to be true and I should still move out.\n\nAIO for still being hesitant even after the apology and extremely generous offer?\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** why do you have a teenage roommate?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Last year of college at off campus-housing :)\n\n**Commenter 2:** Does sound too good to be true. Will your dog be safe?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That’s the most important question.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Do not take the bait.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I don’t want to, but tbh it would really help me financially :/.\n\n**Commenter 4:** $2k for being an asshole seems unlikely. And if the house plan is legit, is your roommate moving out then too?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I think she would finish up her lease here and then move out after, so technically yes\n\n**Commenter 5:** It does sound too good to be true. He probably means it for now, but next month he’ll be complaining about it. I’d tell them I appreciate the apology and the offer, but I’d still be moving out. Nothing personal, you just can’t expect anybody (ANYBODY) to follow thru on an offer like that.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Someone suggested I get a contract, what do you think?\n\n**Commenter 6:** not overreacting, look into getting a contract for it with a time limit on how long he\'s allowed to stay etc.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Omg exactly!! If hes actually getting better, and willing not only to pay half of my rent, but also ALL of my dogs’ food, AND he did say 3-4 months only. I am thinking about putting this in a contract and see if he would actually sign\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/CB1vrZLhLT): **October 28, 2025 (next day)**\n\nAIO for thinking my roommate’s boyfriend is just going to “stay over” constantly after I said he can’t move in?\n\nNote: Thank you to this community for all the help!! I think everything is going back to normal now, but I need advice again (sorry my life is so messy right now 🥲)\n\nOkay, so I slept on it like I said I would, and this morning I asked my roommate if we could talk privately.\n\nI told her I really appreciated the apology and the conversation we had, but after thinking about it, I don’t feel comfortable with him moving in. I explained that regardless of the money he’s offering, I can’t live with someone who initially dismissed my medical needs so easily. I need to feel safe in my own home, and I need to know my service dog can do her job without restrictions or tension.\n\nMy roommate actually took it really well. She said she completely understands and that my decision doesn’t change anything between us. She told me she really enjoyed our time together yesterday just talking and eating our charcuterie board and that she’s glad we were able to work everything through. She said he won’t be moving in, and that’s final.\n\nLater, I overheard them talking in her room. From what I could gather, it sounds like he came over last night while I was sleeping. And from their conversation, it seems like he’s planning to sleep over again tonight too.\n\nI’m trying not to jump to conclusions, but I’m a little concerned this is going to turn into him just “staying over” constantly instead of officially moving in.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Now you go over your lease and talk to your landlord. \n\nTime for you to find a new place. \n\n**Commenter 2:** He’s just always going to be around, even if he says he isn’t living there. I expect that he’s slowly going to bring things into her room, one backpack at a time. It’s best you move.\n\n**Commenter 3:** You have every right to address your concerns to your roommate. You live there. You\'re not over reacting at all. If I were you, honestly, I would not feel comfortable with him being there at all. He sounds like a manipulator. I wouldn\'t take any dog food or treats from him either for your dog, let alone feed your dog whatever he gifts you. He is trying to weasel his way in to live there and will continue to do so. You both are young and with him being 30 years old, he will try to control every situation that arises. Your friend should seriously think about the relationship with him.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Sooooooo this dude is still moving in anyway? Unofficially.\n\nYou need to speak to your landlord about him always staying over, wanting to move in and now back to staying over when you said no.\n\n**Commenter 5:** NOR. You need to make a final decision and MOVE. This situation is not going to get better and her boyfriend will be there constantly. Soon, you’ll come home and see he’s moved in all of his things.\n\nAt this point, you need to tell the landlord a third party is living there while still making arrangements to move. You will not win while your roomie and boyfriend are plotting behind your back.\n\nPlease move and do not sign another lease or you will regret it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1onyra2/aio_for_refusing_to_crate_my_service_dog_so_my/', 3244, 337, '2025-11-04 12:00:04', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

We’re not the “speak every single day laurel/susannah” type friends, but I genuinely considered her a sister and her parents like an aunt and uncle. Our families are close. My whole family is invited to her wedding, as is my boyfriend’s family (my boyfriend is Sophie’s brother’s best friend). That’s how close we all are. So I wasn’t really surprised when she asked me to be her maid of honour and i think I’ve been a good one.\n\nWell, two weeks ago Sophie, the other bridesmaids, and I went to try on bridesmaid dresses. I thought we all had a good time and that it was a successful trip as we found dresses. \n\nApparently not really, because a couple of days later Sophie asked to meet me. She asked that I step down from being maid of honour. She said seeing me in the bridesmaid dress made her realise she just didn’t want me stealing focus from her and that she wouldn’t feel good standing up there knowing everyone was probably comparing us. I was so hurt, I admit I cried right there in the coffee shop. Partly because I never wanted her to think that anyone would be thinking anything other than that she was the most beautiful bride on her wedding day, and partly because I was just so excited to be up there with her and she was kicking me out over something that I couldn’t even control and wasn’t really true. So I said fine, it’s her wedding, if she didn’t want me up there I wouldn’t be, but I wasn’t going to come to the wedding as a guest when clearly my presence was going to be a burden to her. \n\nSophie said that wasn’t what she meant, and I asked her to explain. She said she desperately wanted me there so she was going to put aside her feelings but she just wanted pictures at the alter to be with her looking the best and to have that moment with everyone looking at her up there. She also wanted me to tell everyone I dropped out because I was too busy. I said none of this felt fair and I wasn’t going to lie for her. I was a good friend and did nothing wrong and she was being a brat but that was her prerogative and I didn’t have to play along.\n\nI told my boyfriend about this who was pretty horrified, and agreed that if I didn’t want to go I shouldn’t (although he still is because he’s friends with the groom). But my mum and stepdad think I would be the AH if I didn’t go. My mum said it’s also been obvious that Sophie was insecure (I never noticed this) and that she can understand where she’s coming from. She said I’ve had the spotlight our whole lives (again, I don’t think this is true! Sophie is far more outgoing and well liked than I have ever been) and even though it’s pretty sad, maybe she does deserve to be the princess on her wedding day and I shouldn’t hate her for it. She says I’ll regret missing the wedding over this. My stepdad says I should go because she’s my oldest friend and even if she is being unfair, sometimes you have to let people be irrational. I really don’t know now. Sophie and I have so many mutual friends there’s not a lot of people I can ask about this without it getting back to her, so here I am.\n\nI feel like maybe I’m being a jerk having this blowup but I don’t see why I should even stay friends with someone who would exclude me from her wedding party over something superficial. And clearly she’s been sitting on these feelings forever. Not to mention I already paid for her whole bachelorette party and the bridesmaid dress and contributed to the cost of her wedding jewellery. And now I just feel used.\n\nSo am I being a petty AH by refusing to go?\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Downvoted Commenter:** Your friend told you she didn\'t feel pretty enough to have you stood up next to her on her special wedding day. I was all for saying you weren\'t the asshole until you mentioned your mother. It\'s telling that your mum has been able to see how insecure Sophie and you haven\'t when she\'s meant to be YOUR friend. The fact your mum has pointed out that Sophie has always been insecure and tou, her best friend, haven\'t noticed that speaks a lot about your friendship.\n\nThe fact your response is that \"maybe\" your friend deserves to feel like a princess on her wedding day kinda seals it for me. YTA\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I meant “princess” like maybe she deserves to have her cake and eat it. And yes, it’s a maybe, because I’ve never thought getting married means you get to treat the people you love like crap.\n\n**Commenter 2:** NTA. Her decision shows she’s not actually your friend. Friends don’t actually care if you’re prettier than them.\n\nAnd honestly. I think your BF sucks for still going. He should stand by you. His friend fiancé disrespected you. He should see they are a unit and realize you two are a unit. If one of them hurts you, it should hurt him.\n\nAnyone who tells you to swallow disrespect cares more about their peace than your well being.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Well, he said “should I also not go” and I was like “no let’s not become those people, it’s not a boycott”. If I didn’t want him to go he wouldn’t, but if he didn’t then Sophie’s brother would know why and then it would become a whole big thing. Plus then his sister who is also my friend would feel like she shouldn’t go and I just didn’t want to start the domino effect. Especially since I don’t even know if I intend to tell anyone why I’m not going\n\n**OOP\'s response to a downvoted comment regarding the competition between herself and Sophie for attention**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** The “spotlight” she’s referring to is specifically male attention (and I guess looks based attention generally from people we meet). And yes, I’m aware of that but that’s not what I consider to be spotlight, or not the be all end all, anyway. Sure, I get approached more by men. But Sophie was always the one with more friends, better grades, the person teachers actually liked, she was in clubs and well known. I considered all that to even out or even swing in her favour, honestly.\n&gt; \n&gt; But yeah, it’s true I never realised that the male /looks attention thing bothered her that much. But to be fair, mothers do pick up on things about your friendships when you’re younger that sometimes you don’t. Sophie never let on that this one thing bugged her to this extent.\n\n+\n\n&gt; It’s true that I’ve always got more male attention/people commenting on my looks, I admit that. But in the grand scheme of life, I never felt like that was a big deal. Sophie dated often while my current boyfriend is my second ever relationship. She has always had more friends, been more popular, even better academically. It’s not like she’s come second to me in everything. Just in this one thing. So I guess I just figured it evened out, or even that she was “winning” out of the two of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thing is, I probably would forgive her, if she ever bothered to apologise. But clearly she still thinks she’s in the right here.\n\n**Commenter 3:** NTA. That\'s because you have been used. Wtf is wrong with your dad &amp; stepmom? Sophie hurt you so deeply, and they tell you to take one ror the team. That is truly awful for them to expect you to do. Also, your boyfriend is still going to be in the wedding because the groom is his best friend? So, in essence, he\'s saying that it\'s okay for the groom\'s fiancee to devastate you, as long as he still gets to go.\n\nYou really need to find new friends and a new boyfriend. Unfortunately, it\'s not so easy getting new parents. You should really let your parents how horrible they made you feel by putting their interests over their own daughter\'s.\n\nYou are no longer in the wedding, so send Sophie a bill for the bachelorette party and the wedding jewelry. Let her know that because you are no longer the MOH, it is her new MOH\'s obligation to pay. If she refuses, take her to small claims court.\n\nDon\'t go to the wedding. It will be so uncomfortable for you, and you won\'t enjoy a minute of it.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** My boyfriend is going because his whole family is going and I told him not to skip it on my account. Because if he also skips then it’ll become a big thing. I don’t want him to boycott in solidarity, I think that’s childish.\n\n**OOP on if she is professionally more successful than Sophie?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No, not at all. I’ve inherited some savings, and my boyfriend takes care of our household expenses so I have more disposable income. But Sophie is far ahead of me professionally and is much more career minded.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Hmm wow I wonder if your better financial situation is viewed by Sophie as an extension of something like your looks that you didnt have to \"work\" for. Although of course inherited moeny/relationship financial support absolutely shouldn\'t be thought about in those terms.\n\nYour boyfriend is also Sophie\'s brother\'s best friend. Did you meet your boyfriend through Sophie\'s family? I wonder if she feels like your family and even her family all favor you (her mother, brother, aunt, cousin, groom) and the wedding was just another reminder.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I guess I kind of met him through her family. Her brother and my bf did the same sport that’s how they knew each other. My stepbrother also competed in the same sport so I knew who he was anyway but they were in different categories. But yeah I guess I got talking to him and stayed in his orbit because of Sophie’s brother because they stayed friends all those years so he was kind of around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously it’s weird looking back on it now because you question how you remember things. I always felt like I was the annoying one, not in a mean way, but we’re the only two girls in the immediate family (she has a brother, I have all stepbrothers) and I was always the “difficult” one because I didn’t like trying new things or I just wasn’t as easy going. The boys always thought I was a bit of a stick in the mud.\n\n**OOP explains more about her family\'s background with Sophie\'s family and friend group**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Firstly, our families are close, as in, our mothers were/are close, and we were close. My mother was single for a while so I guess yeah, we did get more absorbed into her family because we went over there more rather than them all coming to us. Then she got with my stepdad and it was more equal because the boys would hang out all together although my stepbrothers are quite a bit younger. She wasn’t really close to my stepbrothers because of the age gap, and I wasn’t really close to her brother for most of my life. It was only when my now boyfriend and I were getting closer that I got a bit more absorbed into their friend group and now talk to her brother a lot more. I didn’t just “steal” her family or something. Same with her mum, I’m not close to her really, but she’s my mum’s best friend and I’m closer to my own mother than Sophie is to hers, hence how I got this info. I assumed she didn’t say the comment exactly like that because that’s not even how my mum relayed it to me, and my mother god bless her is lucky if she remembers even the general idea of what someone tells her. So it was Chinese whispers. And okay it’s an assumption that she wasn’t really harsh about how she said it because i don’t know her to be cruel. Maybe she is and I don’t know. So yeah okay that was an assumption, but it wasn’t a defence. However she said it wasn’t the right thing to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; But as for the groom, idk maybe I’m just nuts but this man saying “she’s perfect” and literally meaning that I am “perfect” in his eyes seems like an insane comment. Why would he think that? Why would he say that in front of his fiancé and her brother and his own friend? He doesn’t even know me well enough to confidently hold that opinion. Like it would come out of nowhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it seems kind of unfair to say it’s my fault I didn’t know how she felt. She did tell me about her insecurities, and I told her about mine, and we supported each other. She just never mentioned that they had anything to do with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HCvUydCUOu): **October 29, 2025 (nearly three weeks later)**\n\nUpdate - My friend didn’t want me as MOH because of my looks\n\nSo idk if anyone wanted an update but the situation has somewhat concluded now and I thought I would provide some closure.\n\nFirstly, some digging was done by my boyfriend and myself, and we thinkkk we found the root(s) of the issue. \n\nA couple of months ago, my bf, Sophie’s brother, the groom, and Sophie were out for drinks. I remember this night, I had an event for another friend and couldn’t go. Over drinks, the groom apparently asked when my bf was going to propose to me, and my bf said “probably sometime next year”. Groom then made a comment to the effect of “why would you wait that long, she’s perfect”. \n\nNow, according to both my boyfriend and Sophie’s brother, Sophie was really mad about this because Groom waited several years to propose to her. She’s been bringing it up to him regularly since. Obviously we all assume he meant “perfect for you” not literally perfect, but Sophie appears to be taking it personally. \n\nThe second thing is that my mother did a little gentle probing and it turns out that at the bridesmaid fitting, Sophie’s mum told Sophie that she should have chosen a dress that wasn’t going to make me look better than her (I don’t think she said it like that to Sophie this is just how she relayed it to my mum) and draw attention. \n\nAccording to Sophie’s mum, her aunt and cousin said the same thing and I guess one of ganged up on her about it. She also has been on Sophie about a pre wedding diet. So it seems like these two things got blown out of proportion and ended up in Sophie’s request that I not be MOH.\n\nI ended up deciding not to speak to Sophie about any of this. She’s planning her wedding, she should enjoy this time, I don’t want to make this about me, or our friendship. And if I’m being totally honest, I was kind of done with the friendship after the initial conversation. I wanted to know the reasons for my own peace of mind but the truth is, nothing was going to change the fact that she took her feelings out on me, who only ever wanted to support her. None of these things came from me or had anything to do with me but she chose to take a wrecking ball to a 20 year friendship rather than confront the people who upset her. I can’t wrap my head around that and I’m not going to try going forward.\n\nThat being said, I decided to go to the wedding, as my boyfriend’s plus one essentially, just for closure to this entire mess. Now that I’ve calmed down, I really don’t feel any particular way about going. I’ll eat, I’ll drink, I’ll clap, and Sophie will just be the wife of my boyfriend’s friend from now on, I guess. I haven’t told anyone why I’m not MOH, I just said in the group chat that it was for “personal reasons” and everyone can speculate. Once the wedding is over, I’ll tell our mutual friends the truth and they can do with that info what they will.\n\nSophie has reached out since to talk, but I sent her a message telling her that I’ll be at the wedding as a guest and that I hope she enjoys this time in her life and wishing her the best and haven’t been replying to anything else. It’s surprised me how quickly I’ve reached the numbness of just not caring anymore, but that’s where I’m at. I genuinely wish her the best but I just have zero interest in being part of her life anymore. I just can’t see her or anything about our friendship the same way anymore.\n\nSo…that’s that. I don’t really know what else to include. If anyone has anything else to ask that I’ve missed, feel free to ask. Thank you to everyone who commented!\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Downvoted Commenter:** Please don’t tell your mutual friends the whole story. Why stir up more drama? Let the whole thing fade away and move on.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Because they’re going to want to know why we’re not hanging out or close anymore. And I have no reason to lie to my friends.\n\n**Commenter 1:** The fiancé could have realised his own mistake in delaying his proposal and is advising his friend not to do the same. Sophie may just be very emotional and stressed with the wedding so you’ve done the right thing by giving her space. I do wonder if she is also recognising that she overreacted and now wants to make amends before the wedding?\n\nYou know her best though after two decades of friendship. It’s really hard losing a friend over silly drama though, I’m sorry OP\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I had also known my boyfriend for over a decade before we got together. It’s not like we started from scratch, and we both went into it knowing we thought we were going to get married. So it’s not the same situation at all and I don’t think it’s at all relevant to Sophie’s relationship.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know she is trying to salvage the friendship by reaching out. But it’s like all my feelings have evaporated. I don’t feel like there’s anything I want to say or share with her. She’s the kind of person who would take her issues out on Someone over something purely superficial. I don’t want to engage with that at all\n\n**Commenter 2:** INFO: Your initial post ended with you saying that you had already paid for a bunch of stuff because you were MOH. Did she offer to reimburse you for that? Do you think she waited to drop you from MOH until after you spent the money? Good for you for looking out for yourself. \n\n&gt; **OOP:** She didn’t offer and I didn’t ask. I really don’t care about the money enough to keep talking to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don’t think she dropped me when she did because of the money. I do believe it was a coincidence. And she would probably make a plan to pay me back if I bugged her about it but I paid for those things for someone I loved at the time. I don’t want to take away from her experience just because I can.\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oj0945/update_my_friend_didnt_want_me_as_moh_because_of/nm7jt8p/) about not having to tell the truth to the friend group regarding Sophie asking her to step down from MOH and let Sophie have the wedding she wants**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I did solve it. I did what she asked. I didn’t want to drop out, she dumped me. Why should I have to stop myself receiving support from and being honest with my friends because she chose to misdirect her anger?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regardless of what she feels because of things that have never come from me, I have been a good friend to her. I don’t think she is better off without me but it doesn’t matter. But she wasn’t thinking of 20 years of friendship when she chose to make everything my fault, so clearly it didn’t mean that much to her either.\n\n**OOP responds on Sophie\'s insecurities and life being better for Sophie without OOP in it, dropping the friendship between both of them**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It’s not that I never noticed she has insecurities. Everybody has insecurities. I just never thought her insecurities were focused on me, in comparison. I don’t take my feelings out on other people and I’m not a punching bag for people to do the same to me. And mind you, all this stuff I found about? NONE of that is things she ever bothered to tell me, or explain to me. She never tried to let me in to what she was feeling, or gave me the chance to be understanding, she just presented it as like “sorry you’re just not good enough anymore” as if it was my fault. Again, I just don’t have anywhere to go from there. Someone who does that isn’t someone I want to share my life with. That’s not to do with my ego, that has to do with keeping my associations positive.\n&gt; \n&gt; I really do hope her life is better without me in it. At least then this was all worth it. I hope in the long run we both end up happy.\n\n+\n\n&gt; We are in a truce. I haven’t done anything to her, I haven’t badmouthed her, haven’t asked her to reimburse me for anything. I just don’t want to be friends anymore, that’s all.\n&gt; \n&gt; It’s not about being the victim. Other people hurt her, so she hurt me. I’m not interested in that dynamic.

I haven\'t been able to write anything up until now, it was just too much of a shock for us.\n\nBoomer was just a few months past his third birthday. From the moment he arrived at 3 months old he was a confident and vocal boy that loved life and adventure.\n\nI feel he knew his life would be short as I always used to joke that he burned the candle at both ends. He never slept and always always always wanted to play and get the most out of every single day. It was always go time for Boomer. His full name was Boomerang. Named after a mark on his side but we always called him Boomer or Boom. That name couldn\'t have been any more appropriate, he was crazy loud. Easily ten times the volume of any other cat we\'ve known. He made his feelings and demands known at all times. He was our adventure boy, he took to a harness instantly and rarely if ever had any issues with it. He knew to walk around trees/poles and to retrace his steps when coming back through bushes on walks. \n\nSpeaking of adventure and walks. We specifically wanted an adventure cat and we got way more than we ever imagined. He loved his walks so much. Once we started we never missed a day. The average time spent outside with him was over 4 hours per day. It was very demanding of our time but was also enjoyable. We spent more time outside then we ever had previously. We got to know our neighborhood very well along with so many great people in the area. He was very popular and had so many friends(both people and dogs). The weather never stopped him - wind, rain, snow didn\'t matter - we walked, ran, and jumped on everything. And walk we did, all over. We also went on many car trips to many parks. When we opened the car door he shot right in ready for adventure time. We did some quick math and over his 3 years we went over 5000 kilometers(3100 miles) on walks. How those little legs did so much we\'ll never know.\n\nThere is so much we miss about him. His relentless drive to just go and experience everything about life without fear was inspiring. That was his biggest gift to us. \n\n  \nI\'ve added a few pictures from his last adventures. Feel free to also check out our older pics and vids to help us celebrate his life.

They don’t know each other well since my mom either ignores her or is very short. Not long after the announcement my mom called me to ask if I was taking “that woman’s” name.\n\nBut outside of that there hadn’t been much trouble until my grandma told her we were having the cake testing (my grandma is having our wedding at her house and agreed to help pay for the cake, so she came to the testing with us). According to my grandma, my mom said “oh, they are actually getting married?” My grandma then explained that she pointed out how strange it was for my mom to not be involved in my life or relationship and she felt like my mom would be more included in wedding planning if she showed interest. I knew instantly that this would set my mother off.\n\nLater that night I got a call from my mom where she screamed at me, telling me my fiancé has to be a criminal to be interested in me. That our wedding was shady because it’s not traditional, and that my fiancé changed me as a person. She said I have grown hateful ever since I moved out of her house (for context I lived at home for many years because my dad had terminal cancer). After this screaming rant where my fiancé was getting more and more upset beside me, my mom let me know that my grandma decided she didn’t want the wedding at her house, but that I shouldn’t worry because she’d fix everything for me.\n\nAfter talking to my grandma, it was revealed that my mother called her and gave her a list of reasons not to have my wedding. My grandma is easily swayed by my mother, so she agreed at the time. I called my mom back, upset. I think that was when she realized she kind of messed up. She intended to get my wedding canceled so she could get a “better” venue and be the hero and pay for everything. But my grandmas house has emotional significance to me. Luckily after talking to my grandma again, she realized my mom’s manipulations and changed her mind.\n\nI was crushed for days after. Not only about my mom trying to use her typical narcissistic manipulations to change my wedding, but also how blasé my grandma was about canceling on me. Truthfully, it’s been like pulling teeth to get any excitement or interest from my family about my upcoming marriage.\n\nMy mom’s second attempt at ruining not only my wedding but my relationship happened the other day. She called me to chat (I was very short with her because I am still upset), during the call she asked if my fiancé was in the room and after I said yes she told me I was probably pregnant. You can see how that would cause tension. Luckily my fiancé knows my mom’s behaviors and doesn’t believe a word she says, but I was left reeling that my mom would try to drop a seed of doubt between my relationship. My sister called me later that day and told me that my mother is telling the whole family that I’m pregnant.\n\nI’m tired and we still have 4.5 months to go until the wedding.\n\n❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Is it that you are getting married, or is it that you are gay?\n\nEither way, fuck that. I would seriously cut off anything that treated my serious relationship that way.\n\n&gt; **OOP:**I think it’s a mix of both. She claims she’s not homophobic but then says homophobic stuff. Plus she’s always wanted me attached at her hip\n\n**Commenter 2:** Just because she\'s, your mother does not mean you have to interact with her. If a stranger treated you this way, what would you do? Treat your mother the same way\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Im mostly low contact with my mother. Before the wedding announcement there would be months of no contact unless something important came up. Now she’s inserting herself into my life again\n\n**Commenter 3:** First off it sounds like your mom is pissed you’re marrying another female. Please stand up for your fiancée at all times and it’s interesting that anyone would believe you were doing IVF all this time to get pregnant without anyone knowing.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I’ve dated both men and women, so I think she’s trying to imply I’m cheating\n\n**OOP\'s fiancee made an appearance in the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1m374js/my_mother_keeps_trying_to_ruin_my_wedding/n3vi298/)** \n\n&gt; **Fiancee:** Fiancé here! We have discussed cutting her off after the wedding we just didn\'t expect her to start imploding the wedding after she realized it was truly happening. And I dont feel like I need protecting. OP is trying her best to keep her mom at bay and for us to have the wedding of our dreams and, as long as mil doesnt screw everything up, it will be. I want to be moral support for her and my family will gladly kick her moms ass if she tries anything day of.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/fcQUwgLRhx): **October 16, 2025 (nearly three months later)**\n\nSo a lot of things have been going on lately and now we are a month away from our wedding. Since the first time I posted, things have calmed down a lot and everything seems to be smooth sailing outside a few comments from my mother.\n\nIt started off with her asking me to move back in with her temporarily, which I turned down. Then it turned into her talking about getting a new house and selling the one she lives in currently to something smaller where it could be just her, my sister, and I. Then on my birthday, she kept commenting that things were about to “go back to normal” and “soon everything will be okay again”. That paired with her bringing up my ex relationships and asking if I talked to any of them in front of my fiance was putting me in a pretty bad mood.\n\nYesterday morning my fiance and I decided to head to the court house bright and early to apply for our marriage license since we had the morning free before we had to go to work. While there, we started talking and making plans.\n\nSo I\'m thrilled to announce that yesterday evening my WIFE and I eloped at a Red Robin.\n\nEverything has been turned in and made official and you are now hearing from a married woman who has one heck of a celebratory party planned a month from now.\n\nAlso no one outside my sister who was a witness and a few close friends I trust know. So if my mother tries to object or mess up the ceremony, well tough. Can\'t stop a marriage when someone is already married.\n\nThanks everyone who read and gave great advice.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Do you live in a state where you can do a self binding ceremony or did you get an officiant to marry you over bottomless fries? Either way I love it. Congratulations!\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We got a friend who is ordained to marry us over bottomless fries and pretzel bites\n\n+\n\n&gt; We actually stopped at one of those parking lot coffee places and got coffee for the whole car (everyone carpooled with us)\n\n**Commenter 2:** So happy you made it for yourselves and can shut down the haters!\n\nHopefully RR stays a special place for you both.\n\nDefinitely should pull contact with mom back. Like low contact. For your own sanity\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We actually went to red robin to celebrate after getting engaged so it\'s quickly becoming our place\n\n**Has OOP gone low contact with her mother?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I am very low contact with my mom. The first time I\'ve seen her since the original post was my birthday this past weekend. All comments I\'ve heard have been second hand from being in the room when my mom called my sister and she didn\'t know it was on speaker. I respect what you\'re saying but that\'s not the situation. The only reason my mom was invited to the wedding was because it was required for my grandma not only to host the wedding but also help pay for it.\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment regarding having a \"fake\"  ceremony where OOP\'s mother will be there. Does OOP\'s mother know she\'s married?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We are still having a wedding ceremony for the family and they don’t know we are already married. If my mom stands up randomly and tries to object the wedding or make a scene and get the wedding stopped, it won’t change anything because me and my wife and already married\n\n+\n\n&gt; Yes they know we are already married. My wife’s childhood best friend wants to officiate the big family ceremony.\n\n+\n\n&gt; To have pictures of us and all our friends. For the memory of the ceremony. It’s not really a fake ceremony either, it just doesn’t include signing the paperwork because we already did that.

(162, 'reddit', '1ogybrn', '(New Update) My(f21) parents decided to stop splitting tuition with me because I declined their invitation to attend the US Open', 'I am not OOP. The OOP for this post is u/throwraturbulenticon. Her posts were made to [r/family](https://www.reddit.com/r/family/) during the two-week period when the US Open of tennis was taking place\n\n**Trigger Warning**: &gt;!politics, racial prejudice, body shaming!&lt;\n\n**Mood Spoiler**: &gt;!unfortunate and frustrating, but hopeful for OOP!&lt;\n\n[Original Post (September 1st, 2025)](https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1n60i9m/myf21_parents_decided_to_stop_splitting_tuition/):\n\nAs the title says, my parents told me that they weren\'t gonna split tuition anymore following an argument we recently had, and the argument involves something dating back years. We\'re a big sports family (NBA, NFL, MLB), and my younger brothers play sports too (both play baseball in HS, but dabbled in others). I played tennis at my community college (before transferring after my associate\'s) and have since I was young, and I\'m grateful to my parents for paying for our sports despite our differences. I still live with them, and I pay rent. I work two part-time jobs and split tuition until recently after an argument about something dating back years.\n\nThis week and last week is the US Open of tennis, and we\'ve watched tennis together growing up. Over the years, I\'ve done so less and less after realizing my mom\'s disdain for certain players went deeper than your average rivalry dislikes. For example, my mom despises Serena Williams, and she felt that way since I was young. Whenever she plays, she roots against her. And when I\'d ask why, she\'d point to her outbursts against Naomi Osaka and Kim Clijsters, saying she has no class and was a bad role model for black athletes. And while I understand some of the criticism against her outbursts, I disagree with her other arguments such as her saying that she doesn\'t act \"womanly\" and is probably on steroids and numerous comments about her weight that just seem hateful. I understand \"hating\" a certain player or team in a rivarly sense, but that\'s not what she did with Serena. She personally prefers Venus or Coco Gauff and Madison Keys in recent years. But she\'s had similar opinions about other athletes not in tennis which seemed to form a pattern.\n\nDuring the 2020 summer olympics, she said she disagreed with people who commended Simone Biles for her choice to withdraw from an event due to having \"twisties\" which could\'ve endangered her health. She called her withdrawal weak and that commending it was harmful to teach other girls to \"quit\" and \"use mental health as an excuse to do so\". She said that mental health was thrown around too much as an excuse to get out of facing challenges, and that\'s just one of her many takes I disagree with. She\'s had other opinions including some about the 2024 olympic boxing match where Carini withdrew from her match, and I refuse to talk politics with her too. The reason my parents decided to stop splitting tuition was because of an argument that happened last week.\n\nMy parents asked me if I wanted to attend the US Open as they were purchasing grounds passes. And as I\'ve done in recent years, I declined. That led to them asking why I don\'t do as much with the family anymore (like watching sports or going to sporting events or eating in my room if they are), and they\'ve often harped on me for not acting like part of the family (as I\'ve stopped watching things with them over the years). I decided to speak my mind instead of coming up with an excuse and told them that I was tired of watching sports together because it had become annoying.\n\nI hate how mom says certain athletes are good or bad role models for black people while bringing her political bias into it (she hasn\'t liked LeBron since he spoke at a Hillary Clinton campaign stop years ago), and it took the joy out of watching sports together years ago (they temporarily stopped watching basketball in the Disney bubble when the NBA put BLM on the courts in 2020). I don\'t wanna be around her constant hate attacks while watching a game. So because I \"didn\'t want to act like part of the family\", they said that this upcoming semester would be the last that they split tuition (it\'s already paid), so I\'m on my own going forward. I believe I can find more work/hours to cover next semester myself, but I wanted to ask if it would be better to take a break after this semester to try and move out and return to school later. I think it\'d be less stressful, but I could use other opinions because I\'m near the end of my rope with them, and they\'ve held firm on their position since I refused to go to the open.\n\n[First Update (September 12th, 2025)](https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1n60i9m/myf21_parents_decided_to_stop_splitting_tuition/):\n\nAlmost all of the advice I received was to stay in school, and I\'d love nothing more. A break can turn into years quickly, from what I\'ve heard, and some have suggested using this semester (that\'s already paid for) as a time to find bearings for the next semester. I took advantage of my school\'s free counseling offerings and booked a session with a counselor to discuss my options. We discussed financial aid, payment plans, and campus jobs, in addition to finding a full-time job off-campus. I have two part-time jobs, but hours are inconsistent, and they don’t pay great. Even if I take less classes per semester, I believe staying in school would be the best option, and I have another session with my counselor coming up where she said we can talk more about it.\n\nI also told her about the situation that led to my parents changing their mind on tuition, and saying what I felt out loud helped me find some additional realization. According to my counselor, I internalized a lot of it because my parents weren\'t receptive. So talking to her was therapeutic in a way. With my family always being a big sports family (hosting Super Bowl parties, going to many games, siblings and I playing sports), sports was the thing we bonded over for all of my life. Heck, it was a forgone conclusion that we skipped church on Super Bowl Sunday to prepare for guests and on Championship Sunday for the gentlemen\'s finals at Wimbledon in the morning.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, it became less fun to watch sports with them due to the things I mentioned in my previous post. Mom (more so than dad, but he has his moments and agrees with her stances) began infusing her political beliefs into sports (and other areas), and it tainted the very thing our family bonded over. Sports is often an escape from work and stress, something that people on both sides of the political aisle can come together over and cheer for the same team at a stadium or party. Ignorant bliss plays a role in that, of course. But, as humans, I believe it\'s important to come together to find community, and sports is one of the most common ways to do so despite our differences. But when those differences caused my parents to decide to walk back their agreement to split tuition, it hurt because it felt like I was being punished for my different opinion.\n\nI love sports because it brings people together in a world where it\'s so hard to do so genuinely. At one of my retail jobs, our managers have huddles with team members with cheesy slogans, monthly themes, and team-building activities that coworkers laugh at once the huddle ends (and criticize for being fake enthusiasm). But sports unifies people like nothing else, and I\'m sad that watching sports became tainted over the years at home. The only time sports isn’t tainted in my family is when we go to my siblings\' games to cheer them on, and that\'s because no politics are involved. Every family has their own \"thing\", and I\'ve seen many at church when I used to go. From musical families at church who have members in the choir or orchestra to missionary families who travel together... every family has things they bond over, and sports began to change in our family because it became less fun to watch with mom and dad. I\'d love to move out sooner rather than later, but I\'m weighing all of my options. Staying in school remains the priority, and I hope I\'m able to find more work soon. I\'m glad to have found a nice counselor who has options such as payment plans though. The payment plan is the one I\'m hoping to utilize.\n\n[New Update (October 15th, 2025)](https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1n60i9m/myf21_parents_decided_to_stop_splitting_tuition/):\n\nSo, I decided to take next semester off (after finishing my current fall semester) because of a recent conversation with my parents, but I\'ll get to that in a second. I somehow forgot to clarify that my mom is black which would\'ve provided a lot more perspective on my first post. A lot of people DM\'d me to ask which made me realize. So with that out of the way, I\'ll get to what happened. At the suggestion of my counselor, I decided to reach out to a relative for support to have someone on my side, and that relative was understanding and offered to help with tuition since my parents wouldn\'t. But they also decided to call my parents (without telling me) to give them a piece of their mind, and that led to another argument \n\nMy parents didn\'t appreciate me \"going outside of the family\" and said it furthered their point about how I wasn\'t acting like a part of the family. So, they suggested that I start looking for my own place by the end of the semester because I was \"disrespectful\". I told that same relative about what happened (despite how she called my parents) because I\'ll still need her help to move out by the end of the semester, but I\'ll be taking a break from school (after this semester ends) to try and find full-time work in hopes of having a place to myself sooner rather than later. I\'m just upset about how my parents are at this point over such stupid things that are really meaningless \n\nI fully understand/respect that I\'m living in my parents\' home and have no right to tell them what to do in it. But when I decide to not go to the US Open (or other sporting events in the past) or sit at the dinner table when they\'re watching clips or opinionist podcasts about their favorite President, I\'m apparently being disrespectful. I always sit down at the dinner table when we\'re not watching politics and mom\'s not on one of her tangents. But there used to be a rule in our home about not watching TV at the dinner table because that’s where we\'d talk about each other\'s day. I used to complain about it when I was younger, but now I miss that rule. It just sucks that choosing not to engage in political conversations is somehow being disrespectful and not a part of the family \n\nBut, I\'m not surprised to be fully honest. I\'ve kinda gotten use to leaving the room or staying silent whenever mom goes off on her tangents in recent years. The NBA BLM jerseys/court was five years ago in 2020, and I refused to entertain her opinion then when I was 16. Her racial remarks towards Serena goes back over a decade. And while I don\'t support Serena\'s tantrums and threats she made towards an official once, it\'s no excuse to make such remarks towards her. Simone Biles faced similar remarks from my mom more recently during the 2020 olympics along with LeBron over the years too. So when I\'ve chosen not to watch sports with her for years now, I suppose she finally reached her breaking point because being silent is \"not being part of the family\". If anything, I\'m curious to see what life would be without having to tiptoe around them 24/7, so I\'ve already started applying for full-time work because being around them is emotionally draining', 'MadisonBrave', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ogybrn/new_update_myf21_parents_decided_to_stop/', 2985, 257, '2025-10-27 04:46:37', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

Combine that with our current food environment, and the result was me weighing over 400lbs. However, when I turned 29, I decided not to spend my 30s as heavy as my 20s. And thanks to an unexpected wave of motivation, the majority of my weight loss wasn’t much of a struggle for me, and I was able to get under 200lbs in about a year and a half.\n\nHowever, while there was not much food noise in the beginning, once I got in the “onederfuls,” it was like a switch was flipped, and it has been a struggle ever since. Maintaining/ continuing toward my goal weight of 160s has been much more of a challenge for me than losing the first 200lbs. In the summer of 2023, I gained 50lbs or so back. I was able to re-lose that weight, but the last few months I have been struggling with a desire to binge eat again, even caving in about a month ago and binging for the first time since 2021. \n\nBut while it has been a struggle, I have been hanging in there. I have even finally escaped the 180s, where I have been stuck for over a year. As to how I do it, I go to the gym daily and do OMAD. Wanting to have good workout sessions has discouraged me from binging, knowing the gym will be a struggle in the following days. And OMAD helps me in several ways. The convenience of only having to make food once a day. I find it hard to stop eating once I start, and only having to start once a day is much better for me. And while I would like to view food with less emotion and more practicality, I look forward to having my meal at the end of the day. I don’t view OMAD and weight training as THE tools to weight loss/ maintaining, but simply tools that work for me.

I’ve had accounts in the past, but I always ended up deleting them because I struggled with the temptation to disappear and succumb to my food addiction.

(166, 'reddit', '1ok1p3f', 'I got my telework back, and you can too', 'There is a way to get your telework (TW) back. I\'m here to share how applying for a reasonable accommodation for Religious Purposes got telework back for myself, others in my office, and other FEDs who have reached out to me. Since I got mine approved back in July, I\'ve been sharing my experience to help others in hopes of getting them their telework back. Let me share with you how I went about it and how hopefully you can too.\n\n***TL;DR:*** OPM’s July 16 memo and the DOJ’s Sept 18 memo both support **telework as a religious accommodation.** It’s legal, low-cost, and hard to deny. Request 1–3 days as situational TW, cite the memos, and you’ll likely get approved.\n\nWhy am I doing this? Two reasons:\n\n1. to help my fellow FED friends and family\n2. if this administration wants to weaponize religion and use it for hate, I say fuck em.\n\nIf they want to offer such a lenient policy as to what constitutes justification for a RA for “religious telework” then I think everyone should apply for it. Religious or not.\n\n**Background:**\n\nOn January 20th, the President released his [Return to Office Memo ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/)which took away remote work and a lot of people\'s ability to telework. I know some agencies have brought TW back since then,  but a majority have not. According to [OPMs TW ](https://www.opm.gov/telework/)page online, anything inconsistent with that memo or what [their memorandum](https://www.opm.gov/media/q0tbu2eq/guidance-on-presidential-memorandum-return-to-in-person-work.pdf) says is rescinded (granted their link to their own memo is a dead link).\n\nThen on July 16th, OPM dropped this: [Reasonable Accommodations for Religious Purposes](https://www.opm.gov/chcoc/latest-memos/reasonable-accommodations-for-religious-purposes.pdf). The 3rd page is what caught my attention:\n\n\"agencies are strongly encouraged, where feasible, to consider telework as a reasonable accommodation for **religious practices, such as Sabbath or holiday observance, scheduled prayers, services, meditation, fasting, or other religious obligations.**\"\n\nIt then goes on to list some other examples in greater detail like Sabbath/Holiday Observance and Preparation, Fasting, and Prayer/Religious Observances.\n\n**Light Bulb Moment**\n\nI thought to myself, \"Surely an administration hell bent on removing telework and remote work wouldn\'t make it this easy to get TW back, would they?\" But in the next sentence they say: \"**Telework is often a low-cost solution that aligns with the Groff standard, as on a limited basis, it typically does not impose substantial operational burdens.**\"\n\nNow, before I start I just wanna say that I\'ve seen all the jokes everyone made when this came out in July, and laughed at them. I\'ve seen all the naysayers saying it won\'t work and it\'s not possible. I even toyed with some of the ideas and mention them a little further down. So I thought, \"Screw it, what do I have to lose? Worst case I get told no.\" So now, time for some malicious compliance, or ethical gray area interpretation of it all. The way I see it, if I skip out on breakfast or giving up coffee for a few weeks, that\'s technically fasting. If I say a little prayer before my meals, well that\'s a scheduled prayer. If I\'m sitting at my desk, spacing out, lost in my thoughts, some would say that technically meets the definition of meditating. If I\'m putting up Christmas Decorations, technically that is Preparation for a Religious Holiday Observance (and I have a lot of decorations). I hope by now, you\'re picking up what I\'m putting down. If not, I\'ll spell it out for you:\n\n**THERE\'S A LOT OF LEEWAY HERE AND YOU DON\'T HAVE TO BE RELIGIOUS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LENIENCY OF THE MEMO**.\n\nI even thought about what religions have the most religious observance days:\n\n\\- Pastafarians: have 1 every day, but unfortunately aren\'t legally recognized by the US govt \\*\\*sadly removes collander from head\\*\\*\n\n\\- Mort Orthodox sects\n\n\\- Christianity and Catholicism: lent, several weeks of fasting (abstaining from certain foods or drinks)\n\nThe memo even says for agencies to engage in good faith and that \"Denials of telework accommodations for religious practices or observances must be justified with evidence of significant operational impact, per Groff\". My biggest takeaway: don\'t be a POS, don\'t abuse it, and you have the legal backing to TW. No one is gunna go to your house to see if you are or are not praying, fasting or whatever you claim to be doing. Also, nowhere does it say that I have to explain myself to anyone why I am requesting a reasonable accommodation for religious purposes.\n\n**What I did and what you should do too**\n\nSo, I requested 1-3 days a week as situational TW, dependent on workload, as a reasonable accommodation for religious purposes. I just said \"based on the memo, I am seeking RA for religious purposes. My beliefs and values are a private matter that I wish to keep private, but to shed some light on why I am seeking this RA:....\" Then to ensure things went as smoothly as possible, I included a few Bible verses to really sell it. Speaking of the Bible, I went the Christian route because that\'s what I am, but also, if things went sideways down the road, i would use their nonsense against them (which I\'ll explain in the next section)\n\nThe verses I included were these:\n\n**Prayer in solitude**: Matthew 6:6 encourages private prayer, stating, \"But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen.\"\n\n**Fasting and spiritual dedication**: Joel 2:12 and Matthew 6:16-18 emphasize the importance of fasting in humility and privacy as an act of personal spiritual discipline.\n\n**Meditation and scriptural reflection**: Joshua 1:8 advises meditating on the Scriptures, while Psalm 1:2 highlights the blessings associated with meditating on God\'s Word daily. Likewise, 1 Timothy 4:15 urges believers to practice meditation regularly to deepen their faith and understanding.\n\n**Preparation for Sabbath observance**: Exodus 20:8-10 and Luke 23:54 emphasize the importance of setting aside dedicated time to spiritually prepare for observing the Sabbath.\n\n(If you don\'t use the bible, use your holy book, ask ChatGPT to find you some verses that covers religious practices, such as Sabbath or holiday observance, scheduled prayers, services, meditation, fasting, or other religious obligations.)\n\nI typed up a letter, sent it on it\'s way, and a few hours later. I got my reasonable accommodation letter signed and approved. Sweet, \"GREAT SUCCESS!\" (Borat voice lol).\n\nI literally did this the week the memo came out and have not had any issues since. Most weeks I do 2 days of TW, occasionally 3 days, rarely 1 (like I said, don\'t abuse it, but definitely use it).\n\n**They want to take it away? Use their tools of fear against them.**\n\nAlthough my process went well, in the back of my mind, I always feared that it would be taken away and I ran through that scenario in my head. If they tried to take it away, I would\'ve asked them if their local TW policy trumps OPM policy. I could\'ve even taken it a step further and said that because of the Executive Order \"[Eradicating Christian Bias](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eradicating-anti-christian-bias/)\" I strongly believed that they were now infringing on my religious freedom to TW and I will be reporting them to their supervisor, EEO, and the \"anti christian task force\". I think all of this still has grounds and will cause your leadership to think twice if the juice is the worth the squeeze to try and remove your Religious TW. And as others in this subreddit who have applied for it and gotten it approved have said; the fear is real from higher ups in terms of religious discrimination or being reported for violating the eradicating Christian bias executive order for not approving or accepting the request.\n\nThankfully, to make this endeavor even more air tight, on Sep 18, the DOJ released the memo that I didn\'t see get a lot of attention: \"Religious Liberty Protections for Federal Employees in Light of Recent Legal Developments.\" Its 15 pages long, a good read, but to sum it up for you, the DOJ told EEOC that:\n\n**\"we conclude that the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum does not preclude—and, in some circumstances, Title VII may require—the appropriate use of situational telework as a form of religious accommodation.\"**\n\nLook up the memo for yourself, a lot of good references you could use to back up your request are from pages 10-15. To help you out [I\'ve added a link to one with my highlights](https://pdfhost.io/v/qGWQvL7LzQ_EEOC_memo_on_religious_telework__my_highlights_). Yellow is good info, red is REALLY useful info:\n\n\\- Pg 10: \"Read in context of both the President’s commitment to religious freedom and existing federal law, **we do not see the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum as an impediment to using situational telework as an accommodation for federal employees’ religious practices** in appropriate circumstances\"\n\n\\-\n\n\\- Pg 12: \"Indeed, OPMwhich is tasked by Congress with providing “policy and policy guidance” regarding telework, 5 U.S.C. § 6504(b)(1), has acknowledged that “**situational telework” is permitted under the memorandum so long as it is intermittent** and not authorized as a substitute for routine or recurring telework.”\n\n\\- Pg 13 (**if your leadership are Trump supporters use his actions to bolseter your request**): \"It would make no sense for a President who has publicly (and repeatedly) committed to protecting religious liberty to the maximum extent allowed by law, see, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13798, 82 Fed. Reg. at 21,675, to simultaneously prohibit minor alterations to work schedules and locations to allow for common religious observances.\"\n\n\\- More Pg 13: \"even if situational telework were generally implicated by the main clauses of the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum, religious accommodations would still be excluded from the memorandum’s coverage. The memorandum includes two important qualifications: (1) “**department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary**,” and (2) the “memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.” Both qualifications support the use of situational telework as a form of religious accommodation. The former clearly grants agencies “**broad leeway**” in deciding when to permit telework. **In our view, such leeway includes the power to make exemptions for the protection of individual religious liberty**, a paramount governmental interest recognized by both statute and executive order. In the case of jobs for which the agency can make exemptions, **the fact that agency heads may make exemptions very likely means that \\*they must\\* make religious accommodations** in appropriate circumstances for the memorandum to be “implemented consistent with applicable law.”\n\n\\- Pg 14 (really put me at ease in terms of taking it away): For positions where agency heads have discretion to permit telework situationally for non-religious purposes, **the prohibition is not generally applicable and the agency may deny religious accommodations only if it can satisfy strict scrutiny. The strict scrutiny standard is “unforgiving,”** but we do not prejudge whether any particular agency will meet it\n\n\\- Pg 15 (if they say it\'s not fair to coworkers or if coworkers complain): Relatedly, we also note that **refusing such an accommodation in the name of purported fairness toward employees who have returned to work would be inconsistent with Title VII. In fact, such an approach would likely violate both Title VII and the Free Exercise Clause because it would reflect “hostility” to “the very notion of accommodating religious practice.**” Groff, 143 S. Ct. at 2296. Refusals to approve situational telework as a religious accommodation must instead be based solely on the genuine needs of the agency and the specific facts at issue.\n\nThis was a longer post, and if you read it all, I appreciate it. It\'s a lot of words and references. But I did the heavy lifting for ya\'ll. As I said in the intro, this admin is destroying our government, so take small wins where you can. If you\'re even the tiniest bit of religious, you\'re missing out on not doing this. And if you\'re not religious, who cares? Game the system. They’re breaking all sorts of laws, doing all sorts of illegal shit, who gives a fuck if people embellish a little to get their TW back. Sign up for it. Get all coworkers on board (or just your friends who didn\'t vote for this hell we\'re being put through). I wish you the best of luck friends, I hope this helps you out during the shutdown or post shutdown to get some time back to you and not have to commute or go in the office.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Edits 4 hr later to give you answers to popular or good questions:**\n\n**\"How often are you really TW?\"**\n\n**Really, 1-3 days a week. On average two days. I**f we\'re really busy, sometimes I don\'t go ask that week because the team needs me. It really is a give and take. Like sure I could be a dick and be like \"but you said I get 3 days a week\" and then piss them and others off. But non busy weeks I TW 2-3 days, who cares if every few weeks I don\'t get to TW.\n\n\n\n  \n**situational TW is intermittent and is not an authorized substitute for routine or reoccurring TW. But from earlier in your post, it sounded like you TW regurarly 2 days a week. How do you get around that?**\n\ngreat question. Per [OPM FAQ on telework](https://www.opm.gov/frequently-asked-questions/future-of-work-faq/general/what-telework-options-can-i-make-available-to-employees/), and how we our office was teleworking before hand was situationally. It never happened on set days (routinely) i.e. \"I am teleworking every Monday and Friday.\" We would TW twice a week, just let our boss know a few days before \"hey I\'m TW on days x and y next week (mission allowing)\" and then the next week I\'d telework on days y and z. Same thing here. Now I just say \"hey I\'m TW on days x and y next week (but now with the implication and understanding it\'s because of religious reasons).\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Some people have said \"our boss doesn\'t let us telework\".** \n\nI don\'t know all the rules about when you can and can\'t allow TW. I\'m sure it\'s up to their discretion. HOWEVER, TW for religious accomadation is different and follows different rules.\n\nOur boss took away all TW when the initial executive order came out. We argued that the initial exec order specificaly called out remote workers only. Not Situational Telework. **The Memo from the DOJ not only clarifies that the executive oreder is for remote only, but also agrees with our thinking that situational telework is authorized and does not go against that executive order! (Pg. 10, section B, First Big paragraph).** It also says that the exec order does not pertain to a RA for religious telework (PG13). Then it goes on to say that directors who can approve it SHOULD approve it. At that point, like [u/Pinksk8boardgirl](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pinksk8boardgirl/) said, it\'s literally not legal and opens grounds for an EEOC complaint, potentially antiChtistian Bias Complaint, and Religious Discrimination along with violating **Title VII** (page 10 block A):\n\n\"**requires government employers toprovide reasonable accommodations for an “employee’s religious observance or practice”** so long as an accommodation does not result in“undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.”\n\nand also very last sentence, the DOJ is telling the EEOC that:\n\n\"we conclude that the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum does not preclude—and, in some circumstances, **Title VII may require—the appropriate use of situational telework as a form of religious accommodation.\"**', 'ojoslocos21', 'fednews', 'https://reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1ok1p3f/i_got_my_telework_back_and_you_can_too/', 2949, 323, '2025-10-30 20:46:56', '2025-11-07 23:43:30');

Putting the edits in the proper order for ease of readability**\n\n\n[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/rDBkvbT0F9): **September 13, 2020**\n\n[Copy of the rareddit post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/is9p55/wibta_if_i_sue_my_sil_for_stealing_my_book_and/)\n\nI (24f) write as a hobby, and I like sharing my short stories with my small following. I do want to publish one day, but I want to make it perfect first since it\'s not edited yet.\n\nThe unfinished book we\'re talking about came from an idea that I started to build when I was in middle school. I just finished it last year, but because of the virus, I was forced to put that project aside to ensure steady employment with my day job.\n\nMy brother and SIL came to visit me to introduce their baby daughter about 6 months ago. SIL just thrusted her baby into my arms even though I lack even the barest knowledge on how to hold a baby. The baby was fussy and my brother helped calm her down while SIL said she wanted to use to bathroom to pump breast milk.\n\nThey left later and I didn\'t think anything of it until recently that I was told SIL had published a book, and it had been a while since she published. Self-publish is not as time-consuming as traditional publishing. I don\'t doubt my SIL\'s intelligence because she is a smart woman, but I\'ve always heard how she dislikes books cause they\'re boring and drags on.\n\nI wanted to show my support and brought a copy only to realize it\'s way too similar to mine. I compared it to my copy of unpublished work; it\'s obvious it\'s been edited and proofread for fluidity and clarity.\n\nI was angry and I admit I overreacted by confronting her over the phone. She said my screaming was upsetting her and hung up on me. It was a back and forth battle with phone numbers to get to the truth. By this time, my parents and her parents are involved.\n\nThen the truth boiled over, probably from stress and being caught since I do have my copy and detailed notes of my progress in world-building and in-depth characters for second book.\n\nShe said that my brother and her needed the money cause they have a child and the lockdown threatens their work. She said she will give me 75% of the continuous royalty to settle it.\n\nI said no and told her to give me the pseudonym she put the book under and take the amount she paid for editing and proofreading the book and the marketing ads.\n\nShe said I\'m taking away her daughter\'s college funds, she just lost her job, and her unemployment check hasn\'t come yet. My brother is the sole supporter. I threatened to sue, and everyone is furious with me. I believe I will proceed with the lawsuit.\n\nSorry for the grammar, I\'m writing with anger.\n\n**Unnecessary edit because there are just too many ugly messages**: To those who think this is fake because of incoherency, grammar, and structure; it\'s why editors and proofreaders exist. They\'re hired to fix the manuscript before publishing. I didn\'t proofread this, and that\'s my fault. I like to write, but I\'m not a professional writer. English is my second language. To those who think it\'s impossible to make lots of profit from a one-time self-published book with an unheard of author: SIL has a decent following. When her followers by the book, it climbs Amazon ranking, and that means it\'s more visible to other buyers interested in the same genre.\n\nI came here not for legal advice at first because I was struggling morally. I needed help, not to have people attack me in private messages and in the comments.\n\n**To those who only commented that this is fake or how I can\'t be a writer who fail at basic writing skills: if you do not have anything useful to say, please kindly keep your irrelevancy to yourself.**\n\n**Edit:** SIL was and still is a mommy blogger. She started a blog when she found out about her pregnancy, so it was a weekly-update journey, and the blog turned into a full-on mommy blog now. She has a decent following and she makes money from the ads, but I don\'t think it\'s full-time worker salary. I gather from the book\'s review (on social media platforms that isn\'t selling the book-to avoid policy violation) that her followers got the book because they support SIL. I know it\'s bitter of me, but I can\'t help to feel offended that I worked hard on it to have it brought not under the intention of being interested. It\'s how the book climbed ranks, her followers brought them.\n\n**Update:** I\'ve taken your suggestions and have one more talk with SIL without involving other family members. The deal was same as before: give me the name she published under, take whatever money she used to publish and advertised. She insist that I take the 75% royalty because her followers are expecting a sequel from the book. I told her that I will not allow her to make a profit off my work that I put so much effort in. This morning (about an hour ago), she had told my parents and her parents about me not compromising for the sake of her family and her daughter. Now it\'s me that\'s the bad guy. My parents treats SIL like a daughter, so they told me that either accept her offer or they essentially disown me, saying families don\'t sue each other and we\'re to support each other. I\'m somewhat surprised and somewhat not because I never grew up to be someone they\'re \'satisfied\' with, and SIL has traits that they dream of me having. I feel like a stranger in my own family.\n\n**Final update (?):** I\'ve thought it over, and I\'m still thinking about it. I love my brother and my parents, but they are not supportive of me. They don\'t care about my feelings because I\'m tearing the family apart. My SIL is still very much upset and angry at me, but frankly, I\'ve given her a fair compromise. If my family and SIL don\'t take my feelings into consideration, then I will not either. I will be taking time to myself and not speak to them until they apologize. I\'m going to gather all the text messages (can\'t do anything about the phone calls), and I will see if I can borrow some money from my friends to get a lawyer. If not, then I\'ll think of something. I\'m going to sue her. Not to get back at my SIL and family, but because it\'s my property and for the disrespect she has shown.\n\nThank you all for your support. I never expected so many things to change overnight, but it did. I\'m angry, resentful, and bitter.\n\nI don\'t think I can convince my parents and brother that she is in the wrong because she did it for her daughter\'s future. I\'ll probably not have a niece anymore, so maybe that\'s why I still have inklings of doubt. Part of me wonders if intellectual property is worth losing my family.\n\nAnyhow, thank you, everyone. I appreciate every comment whether you think I\'m right or wrong, or if this is fake/real. It\'s good to have multiple perspectives.\n\n**Verdict: Not the Asshole**\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NTA You need a lawyer, whether you decide to sue or not. Even if you decide to settle without suing, you need a contract memorializing the agreement and you need to file for federal copyright registration ASAP. If you don’t know how to find an attorney, call your local city or state bar association and ask for a referral to a copyright attorney.\n\n**Commenter 2:** NTA. Its your work that she is claiming as hers. You have proof that its your work. If you didn\'t buy a copy and read it you\'d never have known.\n\n**Commenter 3:** NTA She did a bad thing and you have every right to try and correct it. Even if she made little to no money from it, it\'s still your idea, your story.\n\nNot that it effects anything here, but I am curious what your brother thinks about all this. You only mentioned your SIL. Does he know what his wife did? Is he okay with her stealing from you?\n\n**Commenter 4:** YOU ARE SO NTA. Numerous people have either lost their job, companies or are facing economic turmoil, however that is in no way a reason as to why you should steal someone\'s life\'s work!!! Girl buckle up, get your lawyers because this is your right. You are NOT responsible for their child or her future.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/rTXoI5hrby): **October 4, 2020 (three weeks later)**\n\nThank you everyone for giving me advices on how to proceed with this mess.\n\nAfter speaking with my pre-law friend, I decided to go the legal route. I reiterated my compromise with SIL and my brother, but he has fully taken her side. My parents warned me that I\'d be disowned and I\'d be dead to them if I\'m willing to stoop so low.\n\nI hired a lawyer and given all the details on my side. My lawyer said she needs my unedited manuscript for the book and my SIL\'s published book along with the copy SIL sent to have it proofread and edited. Because the published book has different parts changed, my lawyer needs the unedited version which SIL should still have in the transaction she did with her editor and proofreader. We took the risk to ask SIL for the unedited copy she sent to her editor &amp; proofreader despite the chance of having her feign \"I don\'t remember their names, I don\'t have their contacts anymore, I don\'t want to, etc.\" I told SIL that we will go through the route of having to use third-party notarization to ensure no foul play on either part (have 1 individual look at my unedited manuscript and the one she sent to her hired editor + proofreader).\n\nOnce I told her that, she must\'ve realized I was not bluffing. SIL and my brother accepted the compromise (I take the pseudonym, the royalties: with evidence of sold copies). I stipulated that SIL must put a message out to her followers on her blog that she stole from me and not a single word in the book is hers. I thank the Redditors for suggesting that.\n\nShe is clearly pissed off and disgusted with me for doing this to my own family.\n\nI threatened her with further legal proceedings if she doesn\'t do it. No lawsuit happened, but I\'m glad I got a professional option just in case. As words got back to my parents of what I did and how dare I got a lawyer to punish SIL because her blog followers will surely lose trust in her and future revenue.\n\nI told them and my parents that if they have anything to say, use my business email. I\'m done with them. They treated an outsider (SIL one month into dating my brother) better than they ever did to me. I don\'t need that negativity dragging me down.\n\nI\'m happier, more free with my opinions, and I don\'t have to feel the need to compete with everything SIL does just to get my parents to love me a little more than a daughter in name.\n\nI have my friends; they\'ve always been more of a family unit to me than my biological ones. I knew I was going to lose something coming out of this, but I didn\'t expect I\'d be okay with the disappointment and hurt.\n\nThank you, everyone. And no, I will not be telling anyone what the name of the book is because I only came here to get a moral judgment and update everyone on what happened. Please don\'t think I\'m using this for clout. The book will not be promoted on Reddit: not then, not now, and not in the future either.\n\n**Little update on the apology**: it\'s not out. She said she needed more time to prepare her emotional state and she\'s overworked with their child, but she\'ll let me know when I can have the apology. (ʘ言ʘ╬).\n\n**New Edit (11/18/20)**: Things did not go as planned. I can\'t give you an update now, but soon. Really sorry.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** This is great news for you. This story makes me question so many things about humanity. What a terrible family you have. Wow\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Growing up with my parents\' parenting, I thought a lot of favoritism towards my brother was normal because he\'s a male and an \'heir\' in a sense. No one told me it was unhealthy for me to feel inferior and placed in second place. Then I realized when SIL came into the scene that it wasn\'t just because my brother was a man but because I didn\'t live up to their standards.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Wow, they really cared more about her \'future\' than the fact that she was a liar and a thief. Screw all of them. Did she make the blog post?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Not yet. She has a week to make it in case she wants to use a PR team to lessen the damage of her name.\n\n**OOP clarifies the timeline of her brother and SIL\'s relationship**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Sorry for the confusion. My mind is running on fumes. When my brother introduced SIL to my parents after 1 month of dating (she was only his girlfriend at the time), my parents were... I guess, elated to have her over more after they asked her what she did for a living. SIL and my brother broke off their engagement twice for personal reasons and wrong timing, so I wasn\'t sure how to describe their love-timeline in a non-confusing manner.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I\'m glad it worked out in some way for you. Never understood the you don\'t do that to family people in these situations. It\'s okay for family to steal or do something horrible to you but if you retaliate in a logical and legal manner Suddenly It\'s family you need to forgive and forget. I\'m glad you cut them out let\'s see how much they care about family when she starts stealing from them. Or better yet when they have to sacrifice for her because \"family\".\n\n&gt; **OOP:** To them, SIL could do no wrong. I think, to them, me being their daughter has more flexible room to offend than losing SIL. She\'s my parents gem that they can flaunt to other relatives. It\'s a weird mindset: my brother is their pride, so technically SIL is also an adjacent pride of theirs.\n\n**OOP on receiving the profits from the book**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I received the name the book is published under and every penny the book sold on from the moment the password is in my hands, tax information changed, and linking bank account changed. It\'s how SIL had set up her receiving payment method.\n\n**What about the profits from the previous sales? Will SIL get anything?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I will receive that too. I\'m taking every cent from the moment the book went live to when I have full control of the book and pseudonymous.\n\n+\n\n&gt; She doesn\'t get a dime. Previous revenues will be given to me.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Can you define “huge profit” in a rough dollar amount? Respectfully, very few self published books make huge profit...\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I looked at the sales report when it first went live. Her pretty-decent sized followers brought nearly 7k on the first day. The immediate sales made the book climb rank and that meant more visibility. The book is no longer available for purchase the moment I unpublished it.\n\n**OOP on if she decides to re-edit and published the book**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** The book is tainted in my mind. It\'s hard to look at it without thinking of SIL, and it probably will never be as satisfying when it\'s re-edited and published.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ofhyrp/repost_wibta_if_i_sue_my_sil_for_stealing_my_book/', 2925, 200, '2025-10-25 10:00:04', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

(170, 'reddit', '1okbncs', 'Traveled around Saudi Arabia for 9 days and it was an interesting experience. Trip report below', '**Why Did I Go To Saudi Arabia?**: I’m a very curious person in general, and I’ve always been curious about countries that don’t get much tourism for whatever reason. Saudi Arabia only started allowing tourism for the first time ever in 2019, and after being curious about the country for a while, I decided to visit it and see what it was like for myself.  I knew they had some very cool ancient historical sites to visit, so that was the main purpose of the visit. I also have a female friend who is from Saudi and lives in Riyadh, we went to college together in the US, so it wasn’t completely random because I also wanted to visit her. I’m an American woman and I traveled with my very willing husband. \n\nOverall the experience was a mix of good and bad. \n\n**General trip itinerary**: We flew into Jeddah and spent 1 night near the Al Balad district, which is the historical neighborhood of the city. It’s being restored and was by far the highlight of Jeddah. The next day we drove 8 hours north to AlUla where we spent 2 nights in a luxury resort and visited Hegra and Dadan. They’re ancient cities built by the Nabataeans and Dadan people 3,000-6,000 years ago. One of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. Then drove about 4 more hours north to Wadi Disah where we spent 1 night (was supposed to be 2, more details below). Then drove back south about 4 hours to Umluj, a coastal town on the Red Sea, where we spent 1 night just to relax. Then drove 5 hours back to Jeddah and flew to Riyadh the next morning. Ended the trip with 3 days in Riyadh in the Olaya district, visited the national museum, Diriyah, and the KAFD district. \n\n\n**The Good**:\n\n- AlUla was incredible and the resorts there are gorgeous. Hegra was incredible, the history is just amazing and the sights are magnificent. They’re very set up for tourism with plenty of hotels and tour guides \n\n- Things are generally cheap compared to the western US. A meal in a regular restaurant was around $5 USD per person, sometimes much less, and the food is good\n\n- Riyadh is a nice, clean, modern city with a brand new very nice metro system. The Diriyah area is very cool and was the highlight of Riyadh. It’s an ancient neighborhood that’s been restored beautifully and you can easily spend half a day wandering around it. I recommend staying into the evening as it becomes very lively with tons of locals \n\n- Saudi people were generally friendly \n\n- The Al Balad district was very nice and is being restored which will make it much nicer when it’s done \n\n- It was very easy to get a visa online \n\n- The western part of the country is generally very beautiful, it’s covered in mountains and some really beautiful empty scenery \n\n- There are mosques absolutely everywhere and they all have free, clean, public bathrooms which was a life saver when we were in the middle of nowhere \n\n- There are free drinking water stations all over the place that the locals fill up because they believe that helping others will help them too \n\n- We saw tons of women out and about on their own, and working in most establishments we walked into, which was nice to see, as that’s fairly new \n\n- The new-ish government (from 2018) has a goal of earning more money from tourism than from oil by 2030 which I think is a very nice but unrealistic goal \n\n- Overall, the country has made massive progress socially in the past several years with the elimination of guardianship laws, giving women many more rights than they’ve had in a long time, eliminating the religious police, opening up to tourism, and setting many more progressive goals for the next few years. There’s still a long way to go in many aspects, but they have come a long way in a short period of time which I respect \n\n**The Bad**: \n\n- Overall the country isn’t ready for tourism yet. They need at least 10 more years to continue developing tourism infrastructure and teaching people English. Will delve into this more in the below points \n\n- The only way to get around Saudi is driving &amp; flying as Riyadh is the only place in the country with efficient public transportation. The roads are generally not in good condition, and all of the signage is only in Arabic, including speed limit signs. We drove about 1,300 miles so we saw a lot. People drive like absolute maniacs and there were some scary high speed/dangerous moments \n\n- There was a lot of trash all over the place \n\n- There are some very beautiful areas, but there’s also a lot of ugly areas that were kinda awful to drive through. Like massive filthy industrial areas with smoggy air and just shitty, decrepit infrastructure \n\n- We found multiple businesses that didn’t accept Visa cards, only the Saudi bank cards, so we had to use cash in several places \n\n- There were a lot of abandoned gas stations and several long sections (4+ hours) with no services at all, so we had a couple times where we were a bit nervous about getting gas (and food), which is interesting being that it’s probably the largest oil country in the world \n\n- You can generally tell that the government doesn’t share its wealth with the citizens as there were a lot of sad, decrepit towns \n\n- Our experience in Wadi Disah was bad. I booked a hotel through WhatsApp and the guy I was texting was speaking English. When we showed up, nobody there spoke a single word English, and the guy I had been texting wasn’t replying. The room was dirty (hair in the bed, ants all over the bathroom, bad smell) and the employees there were unfriendly and slightly aggressive. We felt very uncomfortable and left at 4am before anyone woke up so we could avoid any further interaction with them\n\n- More on the driving: there were literally unmarked, hidden speed bumps in the middle of a 75mph freeway that you have to slam the brakes and go down to 5mph for. I almost had a head on crash with a police car who was passing a semi truck in a no passing zone, I had to pull entirely off the road suddenly to avoid the crash. Driving in Jeddah is absolute chaos, there are huge 6 car wide roads with zero lines, other cars get within 2 inches of your car in traffic areas, people will drive the wrong way down a divided highway for 1+ mile to avoid having to u-turn at the next intersection, it was truly the most chaotic driving I’ve ever seen, and I’ve driven in both west and east Africa. \n\n- The country is heavily pushing to expand tourism, but they’re not ready for it. They need to fix their roads, make English speed limit and street signs, teach their people English, build a lot more non-luxury hotels, expand their public transportation, build a lot more general infrastructure like stores and gas stations, and a lot more. \n\n**Overall, it’s hard for me to recommend visiting the country to most people**. AlUla was amazing and I do recommend visiting it. It’s like Petra but with almost nobody there. But if I were to redo this trip, I would have flown straight to AlUla and then straight to Riyadh and that’s it. There are some beautiful areas in the western region, but not really worth driving 20+ hours for. It was nice to see how far the country has come socially in the past 7 years, and I’m glad to see women finally, *mostly* have the freedom they deserve. But there’s still much more progress to be made before Saudi can become a realistic tourist destination. Overall my curiosity about the country is satiated and I don’t plan on returning for a long time, until they’re really ready for tourism, which I expect will take 10-20 more years. \n\n\n', 'olliecakerbake', 'travel', 'https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1okbncs/traveled_around_saudi_arabia_for_9_days_and_it/', 2819, 257, '2025-10-31 03:03:26', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

There. Someone. Who. Speaks. English?\"\n\nFriend and I have seen this before, we **know** it\'s about to get funny because she\'s absolutely going to fuck with them now.\n\nShe puts on the most placid, vacant smile, enhances her own accent, and says, \"Ohhhh, I speak English! You sit. I help, go, go!\" And almost shoos the couple to a table within view of my friend and I. We\'ve both seen her do this before, she just becomes the worst possible stereotype to fuck with customers like this and it\'s always hilarious; she jokes with regulars later that it\'s \'free dinner theater\'.\n\nShe disappears for a good half hour while they try to find someone; the owner comes out to do something at the till and they do the Boomer Finger Snap. Owner stares blankly at them, they say they\'d like to order now. \n\nOwner stares blankly then loudly says: \"SO SORRY, NO ENGLISH.\" While poitning to herself. She is also fluent in English. She goes intot he back again.\n\nHer sister comes back out with that same vacant smile on and goes to take their order, just nodding at literally everything they say; they order pho, cool. She comes back with the pho, a pho spoon for each of them, and chopsticks then walks away.\n\nFriend and I get to watch these two struggle to figure out what to do with this as they clearly do not know how to use chopsticks. It\'s hilarious to watch. We\'re both sure the owner, kitchen staff, and her sister are watching on the cameras in back.\n\n**The restaurant does have forks and spoons but when they came in the sister had been just starting to put clean flatware out so none of the tables had it yet.**\n\nEventually, she comes back out, \"How is food?\" Same vacant smile.\n\nThey ask for forks.\n\n\"No fork. Only chopstick!\" Still smiling. \"You try!\" She pointed to the chopsticks on the table, \"Very easy! Child can do!\" and walks away again.\n\nFriend and I get more of the show of these two desperately struggling to figure out how to eat noodles or anything with chopsticks. Owner\'s sister comes back to check on them, they ask for forks again.\n\n\"No fork. Only chopstick!\"\n\nThe Karen at the table points to the table I\'m at, \"Well why do they have forks at that table then?\"\n\nOwner\'s sister does not miss a beat, \"Oh, they bring from home!\"\n\nFriend and I just nod in agreement with her, never mind that we\'re both eating with chopsticks and the fork/spoon/knife combo is wrapped in a napkin with that paper holder around it, which is a pretty clear indication they belong to the restaurant.\n\nThe husband just **LOSES** it at that point, screaming at the owner\'s sister that this is all ridiculous, that they clearly have forks, that they\'re \'being racist\' against him for not providing them, etc...\n\n\"To go box?\" With that same hilarious vacant smile.\n\nThey ended up just paying and walking out without their basically untouched pho.\n\nEdit for people who don\'t understand how restaurants work: The restaurant calls itself a \"Thai restaurant\" as part of the actual name of the restaurant, their menu is split into three sections: Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese. It\'s not a huge city and it\'s predominantly white, so having a variety of food attracts more customers.\n\nIt is literally not \'unheard\' of as, some weirdos in my DMs think, for a restaurant to have mixed cuisine or to offer chopsticks, forks, spoons, and knives all at once.

And when we do fight, we usually communicate well afterwards and things go back to normal. I brag to my friends about how reasonable my wife is and her ability to communicate and empathize is something I deeply admire. She doesn’t hold grudges. She talks me through my rough times. Until now.\n\nDue to a fire, my wife is out of work but still earning her salary (thanks insurance). We decided she would stay home with our young son while out of work. She doesn’t love child rearing, which is something we knew going into having kids. Honestly, it’s hard to tell. She’s a great mom. Present and loving even when I can see she’s struggling inside. I give my wife a lot of breaks. We co parent. Split bedtime routines for our two kids. We both pull our weight.\n\nYesterday was a snow day. My daughter was home with my wife and son. I was working from home downstairs all day. I helped my daughter with cyber school until noon. My wife was with my son in the snow all morning, plowing the drive and sidewalks etc. maintaining the house. My daughter joined them and from the sound of things and some videos, she brought her friends over for playing and hot chocolate. I worked until around 5:00 and when I went upstairs it was chaos. My wife was doing laundry and helping my daughter who fell and hurt herself on the ice. She sent home the friends and we had dinner. I did the clean up and right after finishing- keep in mind I’ve been downstairs working all day, not even a bathroom break after noon- I go into the play room and my wife approaches me. It goes like this\n\nHer- “Hey can I go lay down for a bit.”\n\nThe maybe offense… I admit I made a face and said\n\nMe- “I haven’t gone to the bathroom all day and I put cookies in the oven.”\n\nI can tell I messed up just by the face she give me\n\nHer- “Fine. Never mind. Forget I asked. Heaven forbid.”\n\nNow I’m sensing some attitude and know I’ve misstepped here. So I say.\n\nMe- “no it’s fine I’ll take care of it all. Go take a break.”\n\nTo my complete shock, in front of our kids who I admit aren’t paying us much attention, but are still close my wife says.\n\n“I said never fucking mind. I’ve been running around on my feet all day watching our kids and other people’s kids and heaven fucking forbid I ask for twenty minutes to myself.”\n\nI again say “Go take a break! I told you it was fine.” But she’s clearly lost her marbles and is seeing red.\n\nShe starts cleaning up and helping with the kids and I do too. I tried to overcompensate but she just took over caring for them and they listened to he\n\nIn the hall I said “I think you forget I work all day.” And she viciously says.\n\nHer- “thanks for reminding me. I almost forgot.”\n\nI feel like an ass. I get that she works hard caring for the kids but I work hard too. I think not having her job and escape is making her reaction to this fight worse. She texted me the next day with her usual communication. She expressed how upset she felt with my behavior and the way I acted toward her. She said she was feeding and taking care of six kids all day in the snow alone and still cleaned the entire house and deep cleaned our craft room. I explained that I’m stressed at work and that I didn’t get why she’s so upset since I offered her a break but she said “I don’t want your pity breaks” She ended it with “thanks for the apology btw.” Which yeah, I didn’t exactly apologize but for what? And then she asked for the number to my daughters piano teacher. The piano teacher was the only activity that I manage for my kids.\n\nI found out she text her asking to go through my wife from now on as she will be managing the schedule. Normally my wife would text me asking if I can get my daughter from dance on my way home yesterday. I do this every week. I didn’t hear anything and when I got home I found out my wife dropped and picked her up. I confronted my wife with “I am very present with my children do not make me out to be an absent father.” My wife responded with “if I didn’t manage and ask you for help, you’d see them a quarter of the time you do now. And I’m done managing you.”\n\nI get it. I should have just smiled and agreed when she asked for help but this is extreme. She’s having a fit and trying to ice me out of my relationship with my kids. It’s so petty. It’s like I don’t even know this woman. Gone is the reasonable level headed communicator. So if you’ve made it this far thank you. And please please tell me if I’m wrong here.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**OOP on being told his wife is stressed**\n\n&gt;Thanks for the response. Her reaction is so out of left field. She really is usually the most reasonable person I know. It’s been stressful for her and I admit I’m also so stressed at my job that I didn’t see it. I figured a few months off paid would be a luxury. But yeah, now I see having six kids and a toddler alone all day might be as luxurious as a barrel of hair. Guess it’s my turn to be the empathetic reasonable one. She’s done it enough for the both of us.\n\n**OOP on being told to take the initiative and give the wife a break**\n\n&gt;You are 100% right. I normally do say that. She asks me for a break at least three times a week to take a bath or go read and I almost always immediately say yes. It was just an off moment and I know I reacted poorly but she’s completely trying to ice me out. I had to argue with her this morning just to let me take my kid to school because “she said she’d do it.” And the kids just went along clinging to her and then when I pushed back my kid started crying for her. She had to calm him down and insist going with dad is fun just to undo what she did. He was fine with going with me but it’s messy and so unnecessary. I am scared with her behavior. I love my wife and I don’t want to push her away.\n\n**OOP on his wife\'s schedule**\n\n&gt;My wife has two days during the week without my son or daughter. She’s been painting the house and deep cleaning. My son is gone from 8-2 and my daughter 9-3 Monday and Friday both. I think the snow day broke her but hopefully she’ll come around and be sensible. I’ve never known her to ice me out or stop communicating and it’s freaking me out.\n\n&gt;It’s a little bit why I think there is more to this fight.\n\n[Told my wife (F35) that she couldn’t do it without me (M34).

Her work is closed and she’s being paid, but she’s home with our kids now, including one 3 year old. She gets breaks on Monday and Friday with childcare. We went into having kids knowing she wanted to be a working mother. So this has been an adjustment… to say the least.\n\nOnto the OG fight. She spent a long day with our kids and the neighboring kids, and when I came upstairs from work and she asked for a break, I didn’t respond well. I made excuses and didn’t offer help and for the first time in years my wife lost her temper and cursed at me.\n\nLike an idiot I dug in and thought I was right. I admit we both said some unkind things. But after reddit humbled me and she made me sit down and write a list of things I did for the family that day and compared it with her… longer list, I apologized. She accepted and I figured things would go back to normal.\n\nThey haven’t. My wife used to include me in parenting our kids. I did dance pick up most weeks and bedtime was split. I gave baths. Made dinner. All the stuff. Since our fight, my wife hasn’t asked me for any help with the kids. The first morning I woke up on what was supposed to be my morning with the kids, I figured she was just being nice or trying to prove a point but it keeps happening. She didn’t even send them down to say good night last night. Normally my wife does this silly game where she sends my son to ask me to read 5 books and then we would negotiate down to 1 or 2 and race upstairs. Last night I heard her racing him and came up to find her doing bedtime yet again. The kids haven’t even noticed. It’s like she’s replacing me.\n\nWhen we were fighting I said something really really dumb that’s living inside me and festering. My wife was being nasty and said “you wouldn’t see the kids a quarter as much as you do if I didn’t arrange it and I’m done managing you.” I defended myself, I’m not an absent parent- and said something along the lines of “I’d like to see how long you can manage without me.”\n\nConsider my foot officially in my mouth.\n\nShe’s started running again. She’s cooking really healthy and often. Every night I come home to my perfectly happy stepford wife, doing it all without me and I feel empty inside.\n\nHow do I fix this?

I had this perfect life with an amazing successful wife and a great job. We juggled two careers and two kids like champions, always communicating who is where, doing what activity. Working together to manage the American dream of doing it all. Then my wife’s job burns down and she’s home all the time doing everything. She gets stressed and we fight and now she’s totally different. Idgaf about warm meals and a stepford wife, I want MY wife. My partner. My teammate. And yes my FUCKING manager back! She was amazing. And now I managed to fuck it up like always by sticking my foot in my mouth. She’s still perfect only now I KNOW she’s not doing what she wants and that I have failed her in some way that seems to have broken her. Or maybe fixed her. Idk. Like I said. I’m confused and apparently an idiot.\n\n&gt;\n\n**OOP when asked if maybe his wife wants an equal partner**\n\n&gt;You won’t believe me anyways. I’ve been with my wife since we were kids- 15/16. I know this woman. She LOVED doing it all and she was amazing at it. She always bragged about being a working mom but she never put down woman that stayed home. Her mother was a stay at home mom that got married super young. My wife didn’t want that life. We used to joke about her earning more then me so I could stay home. She never complained about the kids schedule either. She did drop offs at daycare and I did pick ups. We had a rhythm and flow. I think not being home during the day with them made her soak in the time at night more than maybe I did. Idk. But I honestly think she was happy.\n\n**OOP again explains his wife\'s work schedule**\n\n&gt;My wife works with animals and makes her own schedule. She can schedule days off whenever so she is more flexible. She is home to take the kids into daycare and then I would pick them up and drop them at my moms and my wife would get them around 4. She does not need to work. I pay the majority of the bills. My wife’s job earns less, but that doesn’t make it less worthy. She actually effects the world. I just type at the computer all day and deal with air emissions. My wife works to pay for daycare. It’s her “big” expense. I do mortgage and everything else. She also uses her money to buy stuff. She has full access to my account and often transfers money when low. I do not have access to her account. It’s a personal boundary of my wives that she always have her own private money. I don’t need or want that myself so she manages most of the finances. My wife has traumas around being “stuck” as a homemaker and baby maker.\n\n**OOP ADDS TO EDITS TO POST**\n\nEdit: Fuck guys I get it. I’m a piece of shit. I’m going to make this right.\n\nEdit 2: thank you to the handful of people that reached out with advice. Believe it or not, I do want to be a good father and husband. I’ve royally fucked up and I see that and fully admit it. This is going to be my only edit and then I’m going to get off my phone for a while and focus my attention on my family. My wife had dinner cooked when I got home. Everything is fine between us so there wasn’t any tension. After we cleaned up I went upstairs and ran my wife a bath, put Taylor swift on her Alexa and lit a few candles. I told her to go relax upstairs for the night. She was surprised but smiled and went on her way. I’m currently on the toilet watching my kids take a bathe. People mentioned love bombing etc. but I’m just trying anything I can to show her I do appreciate and love her and our family and I want to be a present father. I’m going to do bedtime tonight and probably all next week. I’ll tell her she does so much during the day and deserves the break because it’s the truth. I get that I come off as an asshole. I grew up in a not great situation and didn’t have the best role models growing up. I’m terrified of my children not having enough and I overcompensate by working too much. This new job came with a big pay increase but the hours are longer and I feel like I can never keep up. I’ve reached out to a few recruiters tonight. I used to love my job and was always home by 4:30. Even if it means taking the lost income, I’m thinking about going back.\n\nRelationships are hard. And humans aren’t perfect. For all the people telling me my kids don’t love me and I’m a waste of space, idk guys, just remember I’m an actual person. That shits rough. Anyways that’s all I have for you folks. I need to watch these kiddos and start planning out my long road of groveling and reconnecting. Thanks all!\n\n# OOP ADDED COMMENTS AFTER THE BORU WAS POSTED\n\n[Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/qIfRyTpLWA)\n\nBack on after a while and I see this comment right away. Thanks for asking.\n\nThe update is slow moving. My wife and I had a few nights of talking and crying that have helped make us stronger. I know everyone hates me but I DO love my wife and had she ever expressed an unequal workload before this fight I would have put effort into learning about it and fixing it.\n\nAs it stands, we agreed to therapy. My wife feelings like her reaction to our fight was out of her norm and wants to start her own therapy to help. I fully support that! I also do weekly therapy and find it helpful. Boy was this week fun for my therapist….\n\nAnyways I looked deep into weaponized incompetence and unequal mental workloads and have come to realize I’m essentially another head to manage for my wife. We agreed to be partners in this life and somewhere along the line I lost that thread. She still claims she wants to manage our schedules but I don’t want to be that husband or father. I have always thought my wife was amazing and looked up to her WWAD (what would wife’s name do) is my motto. I want to be more like her so I need to learn how to manage myself and my time and my kids time without her help.\n\nI’ve asked to take on the parenting responsibilities 100%. I didn’t realize she needed to do so much shit. It’s been eye opening. Idk how long we will keep this up either. My wife isn’t the biggest fan of handing over the reigns.\n\nReddits hate has lit a fire under my ass. Having so many outside people looking into the situation and simultaneously getting the ick from me has been humbling.\n\n[Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/oUQFQAXg6f)\n\nI think I’m going to go with what my wife and I decided in terms of deciding what’s realistic or sincere. I wanted to see what it felt like to be 100% in control of everyone’s schedule and making sure to take care of it. It’s incredibly difficult to constantly be reminding myself of the time and who needs what and when but it’s also been humbling and rewarding.\n\nWe both know it won’t last forever and we will get back to finding our new healthy medium. Things won’t go back to before and they won’t stay like this forever. But for now, I’m taking over doctors and school duty and when we sign up my son for kindergarten next year I’ll be doing all the work for that and making sure I’m fully involved in the things I missed with my daughter. I’m going to be a better dad and that’s just final.\n\n**OOP updated in the original post Feb 18, 2024**\n\nUpdate: 2/18 It’s been a minute since I bothered with Reddit, but when I logged in it seems some people care for an update. It’s not exciting. I’ve taken a lot of time to really LOOK at the man I’ve become. My wife and I are 100% back to being a team, but I’ve realized I wasn’t stepping up the way I always wanted to. I promised my wife a partnership and even though it’s been a month or so since our fight and my wife keeps asking me to “forget it happened”, I can’t. My therapist is helping me sort through my overthinking.\n\nMy wife started therapy b/c of the stress losing her work (temporarily) and staying home has caused. Her issues appear to stem from feeling “useless” without bringing in a paycheck and was taking on too many tasks at home to overcompensate. She doesn’t feel like she deserves breaks and when she takes them she feels awful about herself and like she’s ‘lazy’. Coming from the LEAST lazy person I know, I can tell she’s struggling. And I’ve been supporting her the best I can. I often make sure she knows I think she deserves breaks. So when I see her hyper fixating on cleaning the floorboards I intervene gently by reminding her that this doesn’t need doing right now but that I will finish it for her while she does me a favor and takes a little break. Sometimes it works and other times she tells me to “stop fussing and leave her to work” and I do. It’s been working well and I don’t mind the extra work for the peace of mind it offers me. My wife is my everything and her happiness is paramount.\n\nMy kids are mostly clueless to all this. We don’t involve them. And I must say, I made a throwaway comment about my wife not loving child rearing and received a lot of nasty comments about not having kids we don’t want. I’m weary to dignify this with a response but will say what I meant was that we agreed before having children that my wife would not be the sole support system for them and that she would never feel obligated to quit working. My wife is fiercely independent due to her past and a big part of her comfort in our relationship comes from her ability to leave it safely if she ever needed to. That trauma is hers and I won’t touch more on it other then to say I agreed to this aspect before we married and do not mind it. She SHOULD be an independent person. I’d want the same for my kids.\n\nSo that’s basically it. I’ve taking on the role as primary parent. I get my kids to daycare/school and home and while my wife helps half the time, it’s now my responsibility to see who is doing what and coordinate things. I can’t do it all in my head like her but i have a chart that’s been helping. She rebelled at first but gave up the reigns surprisingly easily. She needed a break. I also put my son back in full time daycare although my wife keeps springing him early, I can tell she likes the break. That’s all I have for now. Thanks guys and sorry it’s not more dramatic. I know some of y’all wanted my balls and were hopeful my wife would leave me. While I would be lost without her and the thought makes me physically ill, it’s nice to see people appreciating my wife the way she deserves and stand up for her so fiercely. Thanks all!\n\nOne last thing: I bought her this game PalWorld on the computer. She hasn’t gamed since having kids b/c of some pre-conceived conclusion it made her a bad parent but I insisted she spend a few hours and since I’d spent money, she did. I find her playing a lot to wind down when the day is over. It seems to be helping her feel more herself too. So thanks video games! I’ll stand for a lot of assumptions on my character- and boy have there been some nasty ones- but one thing I won’t take is people saying I don’t love my wife. She’s my person and it is my duty in life to make her happy.\n\n[Evolving..](https://www.reddit.com/u/get-a-lifee/s/wN8JACiU64) **Aug 4, 2025 (self-post 18 months later)**\n\nI say evolving because I can’t say I’ve changed. It’s not been long enough for that. I posted a while ago on Reddit to vent. I was angry about a fight I’d had with my wife about something stupid I’d done. I’ll be honest, it was multiple stupid things. After a lot of… strong opinions on here and some heavy reflecting (I didn’t even know my kids doctors name) I had a perspective shift. I decided I wanted to be more involved. More of the primary parent. My wife agreed so start handing me the reigns starting with registering our son for kindergarten and all of my daughters activities. I work from home and am flexible and honestly enjoy being the one to get my kids on and off the bus. Now, I am the one they call when the kids are sick. Even when they do bother my wife she will call me because I’m closer and I’m free now. I am home room parent for my son this year. Bring the office ladies eggs. Got the background checks for volunteering. Shark shop from 11:30-12:40 is a perfect way to spend my Tuesday lunch break.\n\nThe kids still prefer mom sometimes, but wow has it made a huge difference.\n\nSo… if you can, dads, be the primary. It’s worth every second.\n\n[I can\'t do this alone ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1o8ye0v/i_cant_do_this_alone/)**Oct 17, 2025**\n\nMy entire personality was my life with my wife. We grew up together. I knew her in diapers. We got together in high school and stayed together. We had ups and downs and we build a family upon our ability to love and learn. She was the best part of our family.\n\nMy wife died 5 weeks ago in a car crash. She left to grab a few things to make for dinner. My last words to the love of my life were an answer to “any preference for dinner.” Something she asked a lot and often got annoyed when I answered the same fucking way I did that day “I couldn’t care any less.” And those were the last words. I’m drowning in this grief. A wave has come and swept me away and I don’t have the strength to fight it.\n\nI have two young kids. I can’t drown. Everyone keeps telling me that. I need to be strong for them and I’m trying. They are back to school. Back to some level of normal. My in laws are gone. I’m alone with my grief.\n\nI can’t do this guys. I don’t think can survive this. I don’t want to be here without Katie. I can’t do it. I want to stay but how? HOW? I’m so mad. This wasn’t supposed to be her end. This wasn’t supposed to be how it went. I took her for granted. I didn’t deserve her anywhways. I just want to die.\n\n[Struggling with grief and young children](https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1o9ykfl/struggling_with_grief_and_young_children/) **Oct 18, 2025**\n\nI lost my wife suddenly. My kids are young, 9 and 5 and it’s been really really hard. My issues could fill a book but I’ll stick to one that’s concerning me. My therapist gave good advice but I’m wondering if this is something anyone else experienced. My 9 year old is refusing to accept my wife’s death. She doesn’t cry about it. She doesn’t want to talk about it AT ALL. When I bring it up, she leaves or just kind of shrugs and gives short answers. This is out of character for her, she’s usually the one to cry over a sad song or a stubbed toe. The other side of the coin is my son, who cries himself to sleep most nights begging for mommy. I’ve even screamed “so do I but she’s not here.” At the poor kid. I’m trying not to drown myself and I’m scared I’m failing them tremendously.\n\nThey both are in therapy. The therapist says it’s normal. Google says it normal. Idk what I want. I guess other windows and windoweds to say “yes that happened to me and everything is fine.” But I have no illusions anything will ever be fine again.\n\nI know I need help. I’m struggling here. The path forward seems impossible and my grief immovable.\n\n[Grief and kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1odgq1b/grief_and_kids/) **Oct 22, 2025**\n\nScreaming into the void for help with my young kids. My wife died suddenly and my kids are 9 and 5. My daughter won’t talk to me about her mom. She’s avoiding the topic entirely- leaves when I bring it up, just gets quiet and doesn’t contribute when I’m trying to talk about her. I hate saying this but it’s easier than my son. My son was very independent and wild. Now he won’t leave me alone. He’s with me all the time, following me around, if he can’t find me after calling out once he burst into tears and becomes inconsolable, which annoys my daughter who then calls him a baby and runs to her room.\n\nI feel like I’m drowning. My son is always on me and I just need space. My daughter is so angry and I can’t address it because I am too. When my son cries for his mother I join him and I know I shouldn’t but Jesus Katie, this wasn’t supposed to be how our lives ended.\n\nI’m so alone guys. I don’t want to be here anymore.\n\n[Six Weeks](https://www.reddit.com/user/get-a-lifee/comments/1oe309x/6_weeks/) **Oct 23, 2025**\n\nKatie- my missing you has become a visceral pain I carry all day- I don’t sleep- I don’t eat- I’ve showered three times. Work is being lenient but their wife didn’t bleed out in a car alone so Don needs my help with purchasing “whenever I can manage.”\n\nI can’t manage Katie. Are we so sure we can’t go back in time? If I believed in God I’d bargain my own life for yours. You were always the best of me- my better half. I wish I’d cherished you more. Loved you better. Saved you…\n\nThe kids are lost. It’s like the sail to our boats been cut and we are all just drifting out to sea, clinging to whatever remains of this boat that once soared. E is hurting in silence. I’ve found a good therapist- it’s a farm and they use the animals to help. Your cousin told me about it, even helped by calling. I’m so worried about our kids, Katie. She doesn’t want to talk about you- she just wants to be moving and going- she skates every day now. Remember just a few months ago how hard it was to convince her to go. Now she can’t run from me and our home fast enough. She stays at the Clausers a lot too, I know being with friends brings her peace but I miss my little girl.\n\nA is even worse. He is so afraid of death I don’t know what to do. Katie, you were also so patient and soft with A, and now he’s stuck with me. He sleeps in your spot at night, the smell of you on the pillow comforts him. I took the top pillow case and put it in a bag to persevere your smell. He asks me about your death a lot. At 5 I know he’s confused and curious but I can’t stand thinking about it. I can tell he’s nervous I’m going to leave too. He calls out for me if I leave his eye sight. At school, he’s begun to cry a lot and has been sent home twice this week alone. The therapist doesn’t accept kids under 8 so I need to find him a place soon. So much to do…\n\nKatie, my love, most of all I’m afraid. I’m afraid you died alone. I’m afraid of the pain you felt. I know your cause of death was quick, but they told me you showed signs of “defensive efforts”, combined with your father proudly saying you went out fighting and I just know you had moments of clarity where you knew death was coming. Were you scared my love? Were you cold? Did you call out for me?\n\nThis can’t be our life Katie. I’m so sorry love.\n\nI have to go.

We got 2 kids (a girl 3 and boy 5). He works for 40 Hours a week while I work 32 hours a week. He dresses them and brings them to childcare and makes them ready for bed and puts them to sleep. I do the household, cooking, laundry (he helpes me from time to time but only if I ask). He goes with the dog in the morning and I go in the evening.\n\nIt was always like that, and I never had any issues so far, till I went to a therapeutic center with our 2 kids for 3 full weeks. In the time I was gone, I asked him to do 3 normal chores. Cleaning the toilet, sending a packet back, and cleaning the laundry in our kids\' room. He did nothing of that. I flipped and went mad, and he said he did so many things like cleaning out the garden from stones, even though they would be collected in Jaunary. So his work wasn\'t necessary. He told me I should appreciate that he does household stuff and it\'s my own fault I went to a therapeutic center I could stay with the kids and he could\'ve take care of the kids like always. He told me I suck at communicating because I\'m sick of it, telling him what to do. After a few arguments, I flipped and basically told him I\'d rather didn\'t come back home. Because now he went on a work trip and I\'m now alone with the Kids and need to clean up after the 3 weeks.\n\nNow the question AITA and what should I do after he comes back?\n\n**Edit:** I’m not a native speaking American and thought that health resort is the term what we use in Germany as \"Mutter-Kind-Kur\". I changed that. I went to a therapeutic retreat because of overload with everything.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions, but heavily leaning toward NTA**\n\n**Editor\'s note: posting a comment to help clarify what OOP was trying to explain about the therapeutic center**\n\n&gt; **Commenter:** OP are you in Germany? And was this a Mutter-Kind Kur? Because people are going to see the word resort and be frothing at the mouth. If it is that, you might want to expand on the concept so people can understand that it’s not a resort in the sense they’re thinking of, it’s more like parent rehab for moms who are at the end of their tether. There’s lot of different kinds but they’re usually out in quiet, rural areas, you have individual therapy as well as group therapy and even family therapy, they have childcare for the times you need to do adult stuff etc. there can also be spa like things as well to help with stress management.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example I had a friend who went to one of these because one of her kids had horrendous allergies as a baby and they couldn’t figure out what was going on, he didn’t sleep, was covered in rashes all the time and she had 4 other kids to take care of. This place specialized in children like her son so they not only figured out what was going on with him, but she got help for the stress she’d been under not sleeping, taking him back and forth to the hospital and taking care of her other kids. All in a relaxing and controlled environment with lots of professionals around.\n\n**Some of the Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment regarding her husband can do whatever he can choose for himself to do the chores at home**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I can understand your point if I wanted him to do things that aren\'t necessary. But he had full 22 days for doing things that need to be done. And in these 22 days, he worked normally, on 2 weekends he drank with family and the remaining time he sat there and just played on the PC some games.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you know how long it took to me to scrub the toilets? The packet can\'t be returned anymore and I\'m overloaded with normal household stuff because it\'s now more after the 3 weeks.\n\n**Commenter 1:** So you had a 3 week holiday and came home to give him shit for not doing chores that make no difference.\n\nCongrats on being the world\'s most self-centered AH\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I don\'t know if 3 weeks with 2 kids in a small room for 24/7 can be considered a holiday while I went to recover. Kids and me are Ill since 2 weeks, I couldn\'t leave the room because of 3 days quarantine. While he is at home drinks for 2 days, does his normal work and spends most time before the PC. I guess he had more of a holiday then me :) and asking him for 3 simple tasks was to much I guess.\n\n**OOP\'s reason for needing to attend a therapeutic center**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Work overload, Kids overload because they hate each other, family overload which lives nearby and some small mental issues which grew over the years.\n\n+\n\n&gt; You either take the kids with you or leave them at home. He wanted to work and said I should take the kids with me, so ye I couldn\'t really recover but I could form a better bond between me and my kids. Since I had more time with them and no work.\n\n**OOP gives examples of the childcare** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** The kids dress themselves, I pick out the clothes for childcare because he would dress them to lightly in this weather. They dress themselves at bedtime he brushes their teeth and reads a bedtime story that\'s it. I pick them from childcare, I go grocery shopping with the kids, I go with the oldest one every Friday to soccer. Every Wednesday I bring the 3y old to music school. I try to play with them after doing our household.\n\n**OOP on telling her husband the simple chores he could have done**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I told him the things I want to be done in the time I\'m gone, he did nothing and pretty much said I shouldn\'t treat him like a slave just because I asked for couple of things. But he also said I should tell him if I need help and he will do it .. so ye I\'m mentally pretty down\n\n**OOP responds to a comment regarding her husband\'s mental load**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I do know that he also has his mental load, and we already had some fights. I made the post so that everyone can judge me their way. In his eyes he does everything and I do the stuff what’s needed to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why should I value work that everyone needs to do? Like cleaning out the laundry, cleaning the toilet? I also don\'t get a shoulder pat every time or a thank you that I did it. Its a necessity for a clean home. If we divorce he needs to keep it clean or he wouldn\'t get our kids. And in the 3 weeks I was gone I only saw that he could play videogames till 3 or 4 but doing small stuff was to much for him and he lashed out on me that I treat him like a slave just because of a bare minimum he can\'t even provide with.\n&gt; \n&gt; And the stones would be cleared out anyways in January, he just moved it from our backyard to our front yard next to the garage.\n\n**Did OOP\'s husband have to do other tasks? What about the priorities?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** He at least vacuumed every now and then. I never said his priorities were wrong, but moving the stones from the garden to the front garden doesn’t make sense, since, as already mentioned, they will be picked up in January.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were enough days when he played video games until 3 or 4 a.m., because he was also online on WhatsApp during that time. This isn’t the first time he’s had strange priorities. He enjoys tinkering with PCs, and there were often times when, just before evening, when the kids need to go to bed, he suddenly starts taking a PC apart. So, when I’m putting the kids to bed, he gets upset because he would’ve done it right away.\n&gt; \n&gt; He could do it at the evening when the kids are asleep. We had alot of arguments already regarding this, but it got better for few weeks and then it got worse.\n\n+\n\n&gt; He had no other task. I never asked him to clean our entire home. Just these 3 specific tasks. I know he never cleans the entire 2 bathrooms, windows etc. I would have done everything when I came back, and doing the other tasks would\'ve helped me out with my workload.\n&gt; \n&gt; I didnt explain the entire convo. we had but basically he told me I shouldn\'t come back with such an attitude, I was really mad. And just replied: Ye, I\'d rather didn\'t come back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/gLkrzSipMB): **October 15, 2025 (10.5 months later)**\n\nUpdate: AITA for telling my Husband that I didn\'t want to come Home after coming from a health reasort with the 2 kids, while he didn\'t do anything?\n\nHi,\n\nits about this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/KkosZVAr7I\n\nSo after a year I just wanted to share what happened and how its now going.\n\nAfter he came back from his business trip, he brought me flowers and chocolate. We sat down together, and I openly addressed all the issues that had been eating away at me over the past few years. He also brought up the things that had bothered him.\n\nI also told him that if we didn’t work on our relationship, separation would be my only option, and that if he didn’t improve his attitude toward hygiene, I wouldn’t want the children to stay with him if we separated. He was immediately very eager and wanted us to get to work on things right away.\n\nSo we allowed ourselves a “quiet phase” for two months. We lived in the same house but slept in separate bedrooms. We also set up a detailed plan for each week about who would do what, and each of us got our own free time while the other took care of the kids.\n\nI have to say, it’s only been going uphill since then. We haven’t argued as much, and if we did, it was only about minor things. There were no big fights anymore. He really started to take care of the things that had bothered me and now takes his own initiative around the house. I hardly have to tell him anything anymore. Of course, some things have stayed the same, and I still clean some things myself because he simply doesn’t see those as a priority.\n\nBut I’m glad that in the end, things turned out well.\n\nThank you for all the kind messages from the previous thread! Many of them really made me laugh and sweetened my day. It definitely made that time a lot more bearable.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** It\'s good he made changes after your discussion. But have you made changes, about issues that he said bothered him?\n\nIt\'s good that you are both communicating better, keep it up.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Most of the issues he had about me resulted in the way he acted.\n&gt; \n&gt; He said he hates that I nag him if things don\'t get done. And I only start to nag after the third day if I asked him to do something.\n&gt; \n&gt; He also hates it that I get mad over small things, and I only get mad because these same small things happend daily in the past years.\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest problem I have is when things escalate badly and I shut down because of it, ignoring him for several days. But that has actually gotten better and hasn’t happened again. Now I try to talk things through completely, even though he’s usually pretty set in his opinion.\n\n**OOP on working on her issues with her husband together and how to get things done without each other bothering about it**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No, I didn’t feel like you were calling me out. I just wanted to clarify things. In the end, I’m only telling my side of the story, he might feel completely different about it. He can’t really speak for himself in this situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that was also the biggest issue in our relationship. He and I had very different priorities. What frustrated me most was always having to think for everyone else, and that ultimately caused things to escalate. I had to plan all the birthdays, take care of the vacation plans, handle all the paperwork, manage kindergarten arrangements, organize playdates, manage the household, take care of the pets (buying food, giving medication) and when you’re doing everything and ask your partner to handle just one small thing, and it still doesn’t get done after three weeks, it just feels like a slap in the face. It honestly felt more like living with a third child than with another adult.\n&gt; \n&gt; I’m glad things are working better now. Of course, I still take care of most of the tasks, but he’s starting to do a lot on his own without me having to ask. He’s learning to put his priorities aside more often, and I’m trying not to nag as much, instead, I focus on talking calmly and explaining things to him.\n\n**OOP on what rule she made after the original post and how she and her husband decide on this**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We set ourself a rule that we will talk daily about our life and our feelings. We also ate together as a family atleast 2 times a week. But other than that no, we just did stuff for ourself and with the kids.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Communication is king in a relationship.

Now…\n\nThe RS3 is in doubt the most engaging audi or any sports sedan I have had the pleasure to own. I’ve owned the whole lot of S, RS cars including the S3, S5, RS5, RS6. I’ve also owned an f82 M4 and this little pocket rocket is the closest I’ve gotten to feeling that visceral, engaging feeling that makes you just wanna take the back roads home. There’s just something so unique about the sound of the inline 5 that makes you wanna wring it out to the red line. The handling is Superb, the car truly does feel like a go kart. \n\nI wouldn’t be honest if I didn’t point out some negatives based on my ownership thus far. \n- the car is small, so If you need to carry your whole family, this isn’t it. I take my two girls to school (7 and 10), I’m 5’11” and I have no issues. We use the q7 for long family trips \n\n- there’s noticeable wind and tire noise at high speeds. I’ve read that the Bridgestone protenza sports can be very loud so I might switch them next summer.\n\n- the quality of the interior is questionable in some spots, although if I’m being truly honest my rs6 had tons of rattles and the dashboard quality was also questionable.\n\nThe RS6 is truly a remarkable car which I understand to many is the pinnacle of audi. Here are some observations based on my ownership of the RS6\n\n- Quite possibly the best looking modern audi, estate. Always admired its exterior design. \n- Brutally fast, but really shines on the highways\n- Very thirsty. I averaged 18L/100km over my ownership. Got about 300kms per tank. Spent about $400 in gas per month. \n- Very comfortable even on the 22” wheels but cannot win over physics, it did feel quite heavy and big especially around corners.\n- Driving aggressively came with some guilt knowing how much fuel it drinks and consumables (tires and brakes) are to replace. The RS3 is a no guilt kinda RS car. \n\nFor the first few days after I switched I had the biggest buyers remorse knowing that I’ve given up on what most would consider a “dream car” but the more I’ve driven the rs3 the more I forget about the rs6. \n\n\n', 'Hour-Pie-6447', 'Audi', 'https://reddit.com/r/Audi/comments/1og8o9j/traded_my_rs6_for_a_brand_new_rs3_honest_review/', 2705, 342, '2025-10-26 07:51:28', '2025-11-07 23:43:30');

They will not. Most major addon projects will require entire rewrites with hours and hours of free labor from devs only to be in a very gutted Version and many won\'t bother.  \nThere is also major stuff missing to even make something that looks different but has the same funcitonality as the basegame as many UI functions became flat out impossible for addons to interact with, even the ones that are required to reproduce what blizzard does. Expect more Addons to follow suit.\n\nFor those interested here is an entire writup on Nameplates that goes into all the details of what is currently impossible: [https://gerritalex.de/blog/nameplates-in-midnight](https://gerritalex.de/blog/nameplates-in-midnight)\n\nHere is the quote from the mentioned oUF statement:\n\n&gt;Actually... never mind.\n\n&gt;After spending a couple of hours on the alpha and seeing how bad the state of it actually is I\'ve decided to put this endevour on hold.\n\n&gt;Just to get oUF not throwing errors left and right I had to completely disable core functionality such as nameplates, tags, castbars and auras, as well as a couple more elements. Tags and nameplates could probably be salvaged, but for the others there just isn\'t a way to have them in any working order.\n\n&gt;Blizzard wants us to provide them with feedback and free Q/A, and I\'m not doing that just to help them fix the mess they got themselves into, they have employees on their payroll that can figure that out for themselves. In the current state oUF will not be worked on, atleast not by me. I will give it another go in a few months when they announce a date for the pre-patch, to see if it\'s in any way salvageable.\n\n&gt;If by then it\'s still a broken mess we might just call it the end of this project. I\'m going to leave this draft up for now and we\'ll see when the time comes.\n\n&gt;Quoting haste; \"20 years is a good run\".\n\nAnother comment from the ouf devs:\n\n&gt;We aren\'t taking a break, people seem to weirdly misinterpret what we said, some do it maliciously, others just don\'t understand how the addon development works.\n\n&gt;I see people say that we aren\'t updating things because that\'s just too much work, but that\'s not true. We\'ve been through multiple overhauls over the years, there\'s a rewrite in Legion, there\'s a massive update in DF. We never complained about those, if anything, they\'re fun because Blizz weren\'t just gutting the API, they\'re upgrading it, we\'re given new toys to play with which either helped us improve the visual presentation or performance.\n\n&gt;What\'s happening right now is completely different. Rn Blizz are simply gutting the API. No matter how much time and effort we throw at the rewrite there\'s just nothing we can do to replace the things that are broken atm.\n\n&gt;Sure, I could rewrite the castbars so that they would work on a super basic level, they\'d be choppy, but they\'d work, but I can\'t add empowered casting that\'s used by evokers and in a bunch of world quests and events like the brewfest cooking thingy. I can\'t even add delays for when you get hit.\n\n&gt;Auras on the unit frames are another thing. They\'re completely cooked. People have been complaining about auras on the default/blizz target frames for ages now, that they\'re hard to read, that there\'s no filtering, etc. But atm we can\'t even make anything that\'s ON PAR with that atrocity. And due to the new limitations our version would perform SO MUCH worse despite having basically no features whatsoever.\n\n&gt;The same applies to sooooo many other things like health, power, classpower, etc.\n\n&gt;People keep bringing up \"ion said this, ion said that\", \"combat APIs this, combat APIs that\", \"customisation will be possible!\". In reality to customise things you need to do some maths under the hood, but we can\'t do any of that now because all the needed values are secrets, we can\'t read them, we can\'t alter them, we can\'t react to them. The only thing we can do is to pass them around as a hot potato.\n\n&gt;All in all, it\'s not about the time and effort, we simply no longer have the tools to do the things we want to do\n\nElvui/OuF devs If you want your exta statements edited in let me know.

I go to college in the city I grew up in and am getting my bachelors, but I live at home to save money. My parents aren’t together and had me pretty young so they didn’t really have anything saved for me, so I have a smattering of scholarships and since I don’t need to pay rent or anything like that no loans.\n\nI was always week on week off with my parents and have continued that. A few weeks ago my mom and stepdad (35f and 40m) told me they were finally expecting a baby after years of trying. I was so happy for them until they told me I couldn’t keep living there as they’d need to focus on the baby and there wouldn’t be enough room. They do have enough room but I know having a baby is a lot and it’s my stepdads first baby. Plus I don’t know how to explain it but they were nice when they asked, it wasn’t like gtfo we’re replacing you. I love them both and want them to have time for themselves and their baby so I asked my dad (35m) he told me I could of course live there full-time.\n\nI guess he didn’t talk to my stepmom (42f) about that lol because when I showed up she was pretty unhappy. They have two kids of their own (8 and 6) and she has two kids 14m and 16f and still in high school. I share a room with her daughter when I stay there but her kids don’t see their dad so they’re always there. I’ve always gotten along with everyone and consider her kids my siblings, like if I’m not in school or working I’ll go to their sports games or take them to shows or movies or out to eat and pay for it. They’re really sweet but pretty shy. So just for background. And the younger ones are little I don’t do much with them because they’re barely even people so far lol.\n\nBut yeah… my stepmom wants me to either start paying rent ($500 a month!!!!) or take on a bunch of additional chores. For the record I do chores of course, I always have but she wants me to do things like driving all four kids to and from school so they’re don’t have to take the bus, make their lunches, and help them with homework (in additional to my existing chores of cleaning all the bathrooms and doing the yardwork).\n\nI asked if we could compromise and I could take the older ones to school in the morning on my way to class (their school is kind of on my way to my school while the little kids school will add forty minutes of driving) and help them with homework, but I can’t pick them up after school because I’d have to leave my school to do that and then come back for my labs and study groups. Right now I stay on campus basically from 8-6 but she wants me to leave in the middle of my day (and on some days I even have class at that time) to pick them up and bring them home. And making lunches for four picky kids plus my dad and stepmom just sounds like a lot on top of school and I also work 35 hours a week (mostly on weekends granted).\n\nMy dad thinks it’s a good compromise but my stepmom doesn’t and won’t stop being mean to me. Or telling me that she has had an emergency and I need to drop everything and pick up the kids when the emergency is that she felt like going to a networking happy house (what happened yesterday). I feel like such a nuisance but I know I’m saving money living here. I don’t want to tell my mom any of this and stress her out, my stepmom keeps saying it’s my moms fault but when she had my younger sibs I only came over every other weekend to give them space to be a new family because it’s what she wanted. I just feel like none of this is fair but also like I’m the biggest burden in the world. My dad says I don’t have to pay rent or do the additional chores, but I don’t want to cause issues in their marriage. Aitah for just doing some of the new chores my stepmom wants me to?\n\n**Edit** I put it in a comment but I’m really sorry. I’m sorry I was so argumentative last night. I haven’t been sleeping well and have been so stressed out and sad. I got some sleep and talked to dad and he’s going to handle my stepmom. Luckily they’re not legally married, he let her move in when she got pregnant because she was losing her place and they had a ceremony in our backyard but it’s not legal. He did promise me he wouldn’t kick her older kids out because they did nothing wrong but he’s been done with her behavior all summer and even before that.\n\nIf I’m honest about my mom, it was always us and then my stepdad came and he was so nice to me compared to my stepmom. They asked if I could spend more time at my dad’s for a few months after their baby was born because they know I hate babies and I took that as an eviction. And moved out immediately. I’m going to talk to my mom today, I’ve been kind of avoiding her and not going over there every other weekend like she wants because I think I’m being immature about the baby.\n\nBasically in short last night I was hungry, tired, and needed to touch some grass and I’m very sorry I was so bitchy to everyone. I am thankful for all of your advice even if it was hard to hear but I need to be a big girl and talk to my mom.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Some Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Idk. This is a tough spot to be in for everyone. I have a question. Do you pay for your own food, toiletries, phone bill, car insurance, cost of living, etc. besides rent? You shouldn’t be responsible for a lot of those things she’s asking you to do for her kids but I get that she’s asking you to step up considering you’re living there for free.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No, my mom pays for my car and health insurances and my dad pays my phone bill. I pay for my own gas and a lot of the food I eat since I’m not home when they have dinner etc. so I cost them probably less than the other kids? I’m only 19 and I can’t afford to move out and idk anyone else my age that pays their parents rent!!\n\n**Downvoted Commenter:** Soft YTA, because you have no standing to bargain here. It is not your home, and you are an adult living there. 500.00 is the number because stepmom wants you gone.\n\nDad is being a wuss because he won\'t have a hard conversation with stepmom. Stepmom is asking for a CRAZY amount of duties for a 19y/o in college- if you were any younger this would be called parentification and could get you removed from the home or them arrested.\n\nSo you have a choice to make.\n\nYou can tell stepmom to pound sand with her chores, pay the 500,00 and demand a full lease. You get it in writing that you get your OWN room, possibly your own bathroom, and there are no restrictions on you - come and go as you please. If she balks on the own room, she needs to back off on the rent - you NEED to get dad involved on this. If they insist on you sharing the room with a sibling, you need to may MUCH less, no argument.\n\nOr, you can suck it up, do ALL the chores without complaint and keep saving money.\n\nOr, you can find out what it would cost in the dorms, get loans and grants and move out.\n\nBut you have no standing to tell her no, if you are living there for free.\n\nEDIT: One other option - as all these chores constitute you being a de facto nanny. Make them pay YOU accordingly.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I’m only 19, I’m barely an adult and I can’t even afford $500. Maybe $300 but I have to pay for all my own stuff and gas and I make ok tips but not enough to get by if I have to pay them rent. They don’t have anymore rooms. I didn’t complain when I had to share a room with my sister or not come over after they had their kids for a while idk why she’s being such a b about this when I’ve always been nice to her\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment regarding who owns the house and invading her stepfamily\'s space**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It was my dad and my house before they even met. But your comment is totally wrong and if she thinks that way I want nothing to do with her. How am I invading my sisters space? It’s always been MY room, when my stepmom got pregnant yes it became OUR room but just because she’s always been able to live here full time I don’t see how it’s anymore her room?!! They did have notice, I asked my dad about a month before I moved in and he literally said I didn’t even need to ask, this was, is, and will always be my home.\n\n+\n\n&gt; Idk who’s on the deed, but weve lived here since before he even knew them. He tells me all the time he’s leaving it to me since it was his parents house too. There are four rooms. I had the biggest obviously when it was just the two of us. When they moved in we each had our own room but when my stepmom got pregnant her older daughter moved into my room. Both my stepmoms older kids dads are deadbeats who she can never get ahold of so her kids always live here. But they’re not my dad’s kids, he loves them and everything but he’s not either of their dads.\n\n**OOP on her budget and living situations with both sides of families**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I make more than a lot of my friends, but jobs are hard to find these days and I’m lucky I get the hours that I do.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I don’t think my mom and stepdad are being mean. When my stepmom got pregnant i mostly lived with my mom at stepmoms request so they could get used to the babies together without me distracting them, and I knew that when/ if my mom got pregnant that would be the plan. I don’t see how it’s fair to tell my mom I won’t do that for her when I did for my stepmom?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don’t want to cause problems but I do need to stand up for myself, and I’m not moving out just because she’s throwing another tantrum. My dad is traveling for work a lot and I’m rarely home as it is? I’ll just try to avoid her.\n\n**OOP on her talks with her father about what was going on at the household with the stepmother**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah. I talked to him a little tonight and he told me not to worry about my stepmom, she just has a weird thing about me since they never had a daughter together and needs to get over it because he’s sick of it. Or something like that idk it’s complicated.\n&gt; \n&gt; I told him I’d probably spend some nights at my boyfriends (he has his own place but again I’m not ready to live with him) and I don’t think he loved that though. But I’m done driving the others and making their lunches. She’s going to have to figure something else out.\n\n+\n\n&gt; No I talked to my dad about it tonight. He said my stepmom needs to get over her issues with me and he’s getting sick of it. I’ll probably spend more time at my boyfriends which he lowkey hates but at least he admits she’s being a nightmare. He said he’ll deal with it but idk.\n\n+\n\n&gt; I don’t need to do that. My dad and I know the issue is that my stepmom hates that my dad has a daughter and it makes her uncomfortable. I think she wanted me to go away when I turned 18, she’ll say messed up stuff like that it’s unnatural for a woman to have to live with another woman’s daughter (but apparently it’s very normal and natural for my dad to live with her kids with other men? Lmao) and it’s been going on for months and I think my dad has finally hit his limit. I know he was stressed because they aren’t legally married and technically she would have full custody of my younger sibs but ever since he went to the court to get 50/50 in case something happens he’s been pushing back.\n\n**Is the stepmother jealous of OOP? Are OOP\'s father and stepmother having financial struggles?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** They’re fine on money. My stepmom just has this stupid thing about me because she never had a daughter with my dad. It’s fucked up but she just needs to be an adult and get over it. My dad was telling me about it and how he’s about sick of it and she needs to figure it out or leave. I obviously don’t want that but it’s so annoying. Like neither of her two older kids do any chores and never have, I’ve had chores since I was 8! I’m just done with her.\n\n**Commenter 2:** I\'m so sorry your parents have treated you this way. It might be a good idea to talk to your mom, ask her if you can stay there until you finish college, and offer to help with the baby when you aren\'t in school or studying. Tell her about the stepmother\'s demands, and start distancing yourself from your stepmom. Soon you\'ll be on your own, you just need a bit of support for the next few years.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I’m sorry I was so argumentative last night. I haven’t been sleeping well and have been so stressed out and sad. I got some sleep and talked to dad and he’s going to handle my stepmom. Luckily they’re not legally married, he let her move in when she got pregnant because she was losing her place and they had a ceremony in our backyard but it’s not legal.

I am thankful for all of your advice even if it was hard to hear but I need to be a big girl and talk to my mom.\n\n**OOP on her parents were being 16 when she was born?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Ya they were in high school\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/xUIaDf2Sbx): **October 14, 2025 (one week later)**\n\nUpdate: aitah for not wanting to do extra chores after moving in with my dad and stepmom?\n\nThanks for all your help on my last post. https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/i0idZI2Gqm\n\nBasically I’m 19 and in school, my mom and stepdad are finally having a baby, when my dad and stepmom had their kids I lived with my mom and stepdad. I was 50/50 with my parents before this, but moved in with my dad full time and it pissed my stepmom off. She has two kids with my dad (they are not legally married) and two teenagers, one of whom 16f I share a room with here. Neither of their dads are in their lives. My stepmom either wants me to do an excessive amount of chores or pay $500 rent to live here, I refused to do either and my dad backed me up.\n\nSoooo my dad and stepmom got into a huge fight over this. It started because my stepsister, who I’ve always been nice and welcoming to, threw a fit to her mom about sharing a room with me. Please remember that this has always been MY ROOM. She moved in a few years ago and I never threw a fit. But she was just yelling at me and her mom was backing her up. I went to leave and my stepmom took my car keys and told me I needed to get my stuff out of the bedroom and stay in the basement. I laughed in her face and told my dad what happened.\n\nI think he finally hit his limit after EVERYTHING with her and told her she needed to leave. She left to stay with a friend and has been there this whole past few days but it’s been so hard because now my dad and I have to pick up all her slack for the kids. He wasn’t going to kick any kids out but made it clear to my stepsister that I would not be moving my stuff to an unfinished basement. I was pretty uncomfortable and went to see my mom.\n\nI told mom everything and she was absolutely devastated that I had kept it all from her. I feel bad. I know it was just an excuse for me to not stress her out while she was pregnant and I think it was more so I was mad at her. Which I know is immature. She said she knew I really can’t stand babies and didn’t think I’d completely move out full time with my dad, just spend more time there.\n\nI actually feel really bad. My parents don’t get along and I’ve always treated them more like friends than people who I could lean on for support and I think that was wrong. After I told her everything, my mom actually called my dad for the first time in years! It was crazy. She apologized to him! And then he said she shouldn’t apologize! I thought I was living in the twilight zone.\n\nMy stepsister went to my stepmoms friends house to live, but my stepbrother (who is nice to me) wants to stay and there’s no room for the little ones at that house. And my stepmom told my dad to figure it out. I get why she’s mad but they’re still her kids… My mom and stepdad said I’m not their parent and told my dad to ask them for help if he’s going to ask me. When they used to have me babysit the little ones I’d bring them to my moms so she could help me so they know her.\n\nI don’t know what’s going to happen. But I do see my parents different now. Like I’ve always thought I was out for myself and I’d need to figure things out. Like when I got a speeding ticket I found and paid for a lawyer. But then they found out and were mad I didn’t ask for help. I think I’m going to work on thinking of them as support and people who are there to help me and not people I owe things to. Sorry this don’t a great update but I wanted to get that off my chest.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** How many kids your dad have actually? Wasnt clear\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Three biological ones but he’s been in her older kids lives for like 8 years way more than their dads.\n\n**Commenter 2:** … is remodeling the basement an option? Because while I sympathize with you, and think your stepmother is a jerk, lack of space is lack of space, unfortunately.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah but that costs money and my dad’s paycheck really supported everyone. She works at a gas station and doesn’t make much so maybe he’ll be able to save more money not having to pay for her dtuff\n\n**Commenter 3:** I still dont understand why she moved out in the firstplace, also id take that unfinished basement is a second over sharing a bedroom with a 16 y.o\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She didn’t so much move out as it’s my dad’s house and he told her she was no longer welcome to live there. I’m sure if she was smarter she’d figure out squatters rights or something so I’m glad she just left. And It’s MY ROOM. It has been my entire life. Why should I leave when she’s the brat?\n\n**Commenter 4:** Your dad should file for full custody and get child support. This way he can hire a babysitter to help with the kids.\n\nThe stepmom already abandoned the kids.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** He actually went to the court to get 50/50 custody earlier this year! Since they aren’t married and in my state he found out if you were never married mom has full custody unless you go to court. They were fighting and she threatened him about it.

OOP is navigating the complex family dynamics, mainly with her son Luis and his fiancée, Jessa. OOP is closer with her sons and their partners, but she feels uneasy about Jessa due to political differences and Jessa’s deceptive hostility towards Jaime’s wife, Lucy. Jessa made snide comments about Lucy, and there are tensions surrounding her wedding, particularly concerning the rehearsal dinner. OOP is conflicted about paying for the dinner, as she feels it may enable Jessa’s treatment of Lucy, but her husband suggests they should let it go to avoid conflict. She’s concerned about maintaining a good relationship with her children and their partners but doesn’t want to overlook behavior that hurts Lucy, whom she’s very close to. She asks if withholding payment would make her an \"asshole.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Wg9Y7dXqEi): **August 2, 2025 (two days later)**\n\nAfter inviting her son Luis to lunch to discuss rehearsal dinner and wedding plans, OOP learned there are significant tensions between Luis and Jaime, which she hadn’t realized was so severe. Luis expressed frustration with Jaime, accusing him of being controlling and unsupportive, particularly regarding the wedding. This revelation was shocking, as both brothers had always been close, and she’s unsure how to proceed. OOP was not sure about making an intervention, as her husband thinks Luis and Jaime should work it out on their own, and she’s unsure whether to get involved in the family drama or let things unfold. With the wedding approaching closer, she’s left navigating her role in this difficult situation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/rbxdSZ7gAm): **August 9, 2025 (one week later)**\n\nPlease be kind to me, I know that I have not been a perfect mother or mother-in-law and I know these issues aren\'t mine to fight, but my family is falling apart.\n\nLast weekend my son Jaime and his wife Lucy went out of town for a concert. My husband and I stayed home and had Lettie and we had a great time (although they probably facetimed us every two hours all day Saturday!). Saturday evening Luis and Jessa invited us out to dinner, we told them we could go somewhere but would need to be home by 8 for Lettie to go to bed or they could come to our place and we could get take out and hang out here! I assumed they wanted to talk about the rehearsal dinner. They didn\'t respond until after I got home from church and my son just texted me and said \"we were thinking somewhere nicer, never mind.\" Kind of odd, but whatever. Everyone got home safety but Jessa and Luis skipped our Sunday dinner the next day.\n\nThen a few days ago, I was home with Lucy and Lettie, and Luis came over with Jessa to pick up the ring. Luis has this thing with Lettie where he\'ll walk in and say \"ring ring!\" and she\'ll yell \"hello!\" and then he picks her up and gives her hugs and kisses. But he came in and was just ignoring her so she ran up with her arms out and yelled \"HELLO!\" and he just walked past her! He got what he needed and they left but I was appalled! I asked Lucy if we should tell Jaime and she just said that we probably shouldn\'t - but how are you going to be rude to your niece (she\'s also his GODDAUGHTER) just because you\'re mad at her dad?\n\nBut that brings us to yesterday. I was out grocery shopping. Apparently **keep in mind I was not there** Luis came over to bring something to my husband, who was outside/ in the garage with Jaime and Lettie. Luis and Jaime got into an altercation that became physical. My husband says that Luis instigated the physical fight, but he\'s not sure of the rest since his only goal was to get Lettie inside. When he got back outside it seemed over and nobody was hurt but they were still yelling at one another. My husband told Luis to leave and when he did had Jaime go downstairs to cool down. I asked him what even started the fight?! He said he isn\'t even sure, everything escalated so quickly and I have never seen him so shaken in so long!\n\nWe don\'t know how we\'re going forward, but I finally agree with you all. This is Jaime and Luis\' issue to work out, I can\'t blame myself and I certainly can\'t fix it myself. My husband and I told Luis he was no longer welcome at our home, and he lashed out at us, telling us we were taking his side and I told him listen, he attacked his brother in front of his child, they both deserve to live somewhere they feel safe! The other thing is that Luis works for my husband, and he\'s well within his rights to make him do a drug test\n\nAs for the wedding, I have no idea what to do. My husband says we should just give them the money we promised them and be done with it. That breaks my heart but it might be the only way. Jaime just has told me a few times we just need to get through the wedding and maybe things will work themselves out. I don\'t know if he means that to be honest. I\'m just so sick, I wish there was something I can do.\n\nI am trying to set up some time to spend with my middle son, Cyril, I feel bad that he\'s in the middle of all of this too and don\'t want him to think I\'ve forgotten about him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/0dEbXfdiHH): **August 14, 2025 (five days later)**\n\nUpdate to not wanting to pay for my son’s rehearsal dinner because I can’t stand his fiancée.\n\nI [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/mGQ5arwC5U) posted before, this is an update and this will probably be my last update and I apologize that it’s kind of long, I’ll try summarizing it at the end. I am completely destroyed about all of this. I mentioned in my last post my husband and I told Jaime he needed to tell us the truth about everything. Lucy was working and he put Lettie to bed so it was just the three of us. He kept skirting the subject, and I finally got so mad and told him, listen? You’re living in my home and now you’re physically fighting your brother, if you don’t tell me what’s going on, your daughter can stay here but you and Lucy will need to find somewhere else to live if you want to keep secrets like this. He got angry and wouldn’t answer me anymore, we fought a bit more and he went to bed. I told my husband I meant it and he was like I don’t know what else to do. Luckily my son came to us the next morning and told us everything (from his point of view). \n\nBasically, for the Fourth of July, we had fireworks in our neighborhood, so Cyril, Rosa, Luis, and Jessa came over. We still have rooms for them, and since Rosa’s dog was at her parents, they all had a bit too much to drink and all spent the night. Later, when my husband and I had already gone to bed, and they were all hanging out, Cyril and Lucy went for a walk and smoked a joint. I’m not saying I approve of this or anything, I’ve never seen her high but I’ve heard them make jokes because she doesn’t drink but I guess sometimes does smoke. So basically the only person who was fully sober was Luis, but he had just gotten lasik (couldn’t drive at night) and was a little out of it in general. \n\nAnyways, Jessa flipped out when she found out about the pot and started yelling at Lucy. She said she was a mandated reporter and since Jaime had been drinking she was endangering her child by smoking weed. Brought up that kidnapped British child, and just laid into her. Lucy got upset and went to bed and Jaime argued with Jessa. He admitted it got pretty nasty from both of them, basically:\n\n* Jaime called Jessa out for her behavior towards his wife in general\n\n* Jessa told him that she was just saying the truth, and it’s ridiculous that they call themselves married when they only got married because they had a baby and for insurance, and would be divorced in a few years anyways. \n\n* Jaime told her she’s just bitter that she’s still in her mid 30s and unmarried (this was low, she had an engagement that ended because her fiancé cheated on her with her friend) \n\n* Jessa then went for the jugular and told him that it was embarrassing for him and Lettie to even be in their wedding because it was trashy being so young with a baby and that Lettie would have been better off being adopted by a nice family who was wanting a child.\n\n* Jaime told her if it was so embarrassing for her, his family didn’t need to go the wedding and it wouldn’t be anything off his back. He then went inside to go to bed. \n\nLuis followed him into the house and asked him not drop out of the wedding, he said everyone was just drunk and said cruel things, and promised Jessa wasn’t going to call CPS. Jaime still said he couldn\'t be his best man and that he didn’t want his wife or daughter to ever be alone with Jessa until she apologized. And that’s when the whole Lucy shouldn’t go to the reception so she can watch her daughter, and she shouldn’t spend money on things that aren’t Lettie stuff started. Lucy was really scared of rocking the boat and was just going along with it. Jaime had been trying to get to her and convince her that nothing was going to happen but she was freaked out. \n\nSo of course I asked if he hasn’t told us any of this because he also believed that this was a problem? How often is she getting high? He just laughed and said maybe two or three times a month, he’s not worried, and she certainly not since the fourth. Weed is legal in our state and I know Cyril smokes often lol but only if you’re over 21. So Lucy has been embarrassed and especially hasn’t wanted my husband and I to know any of this.\n\nI wanted to get my other sons\' sides, and Cyril agreed to meet my husband and me later that day, and his version was the same as Jaime’s, almost worse because he and Rosa stayed outside and kept arguing with Jessa. (And I KNOW you all think I forget about my middle son, but he knows that he’s my drama free king who never causes me any headaches). I asked if he thought Lettie was being neglected or if Jaime or Lucy had a problem and it was a resounding no. He told us that he thought that Luis and Jessa were out of their minds and just looking for drama. Apparently after Jaime had left the fire, Jessa continued ranting about Lucy, saying she was inappropriate with Luis because in his phone her name had an emoji by it. [[I can confirm this, it’s a car because before Luis got his license back the joke was that Lucy was his uber driver.]] She also talked about not wanting me to watch her kids if Lettie was there because she thought that since her parents were teens, she’ll be a bad influence on her and Luis’ kids. Cyril said he and Rosa also want to drop out of the wedding, but Jaime begged him to stay on to avoid any more drama. Finally, he said that he’s tried talking to Luis as well, and as much as he blames Jessa, he feels like Luis has to be blamed as well more than anyone for going along with everything. \n\nAt this point we were devastated and confronted Luis about his side. He continued to avoid the question, so I was very clear: We told him what his brothers said, and asked if any of it was true because I HAD wanted him to get a chance to give his full story without any bias, but he refused to say anything until I relayed what Jaime and Cyril told us. He didn’t deny any of it, actually has assumed that I knew about it, and that Jaime had told me and asked me to withhold the money unless Lucy was invited the wedding, which has been setting him off. I asked him if he thought that Lettie was being neglected by Lucy or Jaime - they live in my home and I needed to know if he truly believed that we had reason to be concerned about my granddaughter’s safety. He didn’t answer directly and was like see this is just proof that all you care about is Jaime and his kid, and Jaime needed to realize he wasn’t perfect so I asked him again! And he avoided the question, again. My husband asked him then and there if he could pass a drug test because he was ranting and getting flustered but not actually saying anything. He brought up some other things, including a specific, relaxed conversation that Jessa was a part of and I still have no idea why she would be upset by it. \n\nI could tell Luis was deeply hurt by that and I think my husband regretted it. Luis told us the only person we should be drug testing was Lucy and made us leave, but the next day sent over a confirmation that he took drug test at the lab we’ve used before and when we received the results he passed. Later this week, he handed in his notice (he works for my husband), he’s taken a position at a competitor. My husband is devastated, because it obviously means he’s been talking to said competitors as offers don’t just happen out of the blue in his opinion, but paid out his notice and that was his last day. \n\nDuring all of this, but after we’d confronted Luis, my husband and I started discussing how we would move forward. We knew at this point that the boys would need to work this out themselves, if im going to be honest, after getting all the sides of the story we were leaning towards being on Jaime and Lucy’s side (although we acknowledge the mistakes they made…) since it all seemed like a severe overreaction on jessas part after months of rude bullying towards them. We talked about possibly talking to them, booking therapy, anything to try to fix all of this, but on Tuesday our decision was made for us. It was possibly the worst day of most of our lives, I was at home with Lettie and Lucy and a caseworker from family protective services came to our home based on a report. We were all interviewed and they did a walk through of the house. I don’t know if we’re going to get an official notice or anything, but the caseworker seemed nice and told us she saw nothing to move forward on, but left some stuff about services for Lucy and Jaime. \n\nThey are completely traumatized (and so am I if I’m being honest) and have been glued to Lettie ever since Tuesday, as if somebody is going to take her from them. Even Lettie can tell they are sad. I’ve spoken with Lucy who kept assuring me she only ever smoked on some weekends and never when Lettie was awake. I told her that I believed her (she kept offering to take a drug test), and even if I didn’t, nobody is going take a happy, healthy, and safe child from her parents even if she was smoking everyday but I can tell she doesn’t believe me. \n\nJaime confronted Luis that evening (via text, he refuses to see him) and asked if it was him or Jessa, Luis told him it didn’t matter, so Jaime told him he was dead to him and blocked his number. Rosa dropped out of the wedding, and Cyril is staying on as best man but won’t attend the reception or give a speech. He wanted to back down completely but Luis convinced him to stay on for the ceremony at least. I told him he should do what he thinks is best, he says he still wants to drop out but is worried it might lead to something worse. He said something and was completely heartbroken but was kind of like well you know there’s still time for them to turn against me and try to ruin my life so we’ll see how this goes.  I think he’s trying to protect his little brother by not pissing them off more, but I can tell how miserable he is. \n\nMy husband and I are completely broken about all of this. We told Luis that while we would always love him, but we could not support him or his marriage after he and / or his fiance wasted CPS resources to get revenge on his brother, and that he needed to come over and get the rest of his stuff (documents we were keeping for him, childhood stuff that wouldn’t have fit in his apartment) and to let us know exactly when he would be doing this because Jaime and his family were not going to be there. Maybe we shouldn’t have, but we confronted him when he came over, asking him again if he truly believed that his niece was in any danger. He told me that it didn’t matter what he thought, we’d always defend Jaime, who he said would get over it once this all blew over. I told him he very much would not be getting over this, and very likely he would never see his brother or his niece ever again. \n\nI don’t know if he didn’t realize before then how serious this all was or what, but he kind of backtracked, and told us to tell Jaime to call him. We told him multiples that wouldn’t happen, and he got angry and desperate before blaming us, saying that we’re the reason for this mess, we should have made Jaime figure his own life out and not babied him. I remember yelling at him that if he’d had his own way, I would still be doing his laundry and packing him lunch and to remember that he lived her for longer that Jaime has or plans to. My husband and he started fighting and it ended with Luis telling us that he was going to start his own family and didn’t need us, and blamed us for all of his problems. I was done with that and told him to get out if he was just going to say things with no examples or explanations to back it up. He didn’t ask about the money but I was ready to tell him I was saving it in case we would need a lawyer for all of his bullshit. \n\nI know it would be easy to blame Jessa, and it’s hard not to because I can see her influence in all of this. But my son is the problem and he (or his fiancé with his knowledge and support) has done something so unforgivable I don’t think he will ever see his brother’s family again, and it will be a long time before my husband and I want to see him  \n\nI will always love him, and if I got a call tomorrow saying that he needed a kidney, a lung, bone marrow I would go straight to the hospital to give it to him, if he needed to go back to rehab I would go back to work and work nights to pay for it, and my heart feels like it has the flu or something because I know if he has children I’m unlikely to know much less meet them. But I can’t forgive him for this, and he hasn’t even attempted to apologize. I’ve never been so sad. \n\nIn conclusion: Jessa got angry with Lucy for smoking marijuana on the Fourth of July and threaten to call CPS, Jaime defended her and attacked Jessa, which caused the past few weeks of fighting. After confronting everyone, Luis was acting odd and we asked for a drug test, he passed and quit working for my husband to work for his competitor, and then either he or Jessa made a report to CPS about Lettie. They found nothing, but Lucy and Jaime are traumatized, and we’ve all pulled out of the wedding. I’ve never been so sad. \n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Downvoted Commenter:** Looks like Luis feels Jaime is the golden child. Your posts also seem to suggest it.\n\nWhile Jessa seems obnoxious, your eldest son has stated quite clearly you favor your youngest. \n\nSo while this incident is his fault, I somehow feel you and dad created this situation. \n\n&gt; **OOP:** Jaime simply needs us more right now, we’ve spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting Luis to get him to a good place, his brothers didn’t complain and say we were favoring him then. My middle son doesn’t think we favor anyone, Luis is the only one saying it. I’m sure we could have done things better in the past and we wouldn’t be here but here we are.\n\n**Commenter 1:** Wow! Seems Luis feels you favor your youngest over him. As for the weed issue, in my state, even before it was legal, CPS wouldn\'t remove a child over that. They look at it like this: us the child well taken care of, fed, clothed, housed properly? If yes, then we have much more serious cases ro deal with. A report will be filed stating a home visit was made and all is fine. Usually it\'s on the parents records for about 5 years before it\'s sent to long term storage.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes, that seems to be what will happen. It’s been hard getting answers about next steps because they keep telling them there aren’t any. We’ve never had to deal with anything like this before. It’s not like we’ll need to know to prepare or anything if a caseworker comes, it’s just more the constant threat of it now is causing them dread.\n\n**Was there a falling out that led to Luis and Jaime\'s situation?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** One of Jessa and her friends had a falling out, and the ex friend sent Jaime a screenshot of a text where she was saying rude things about Jaime and Lucy, he had confronted Luis who was telling him not to take it so personally, so Jaime said something equally rude about Jessa, Luis punched him for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I mentioned it in my post but not to my son.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Welp you son just nuked his relationship w/his entire family so his fiancée achieved her goal of completely isolating him. Theres no coming back from calling CPS out of spite. You can keep the door open for your son if you like but I don’t see his siblings having a relationship w/him ever again. Hopefully one day he comes to his senses.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I agree. I can’t ever full cut my son off but his brother can and I don’t blame him.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I\'d be telling him the door is open for him, but firmly shut for Jessa until she apologizes and gets the therapy she desperately needs.\n \n&gt; **OOP:** Nobody has any intention of ever forgiving Jessa, I can only not shut the door on my son but the hope of reconciliation between the boys is nonexistent. It’s almost like he died.\n\n**OOP on how Lucy felt about Luis\'s accusations**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It is sad because they were close, Lucy and Luis and she never said no to giving him a ride unless she was in class to at work. There’s no public transportation where we are (well there is but it’s not convenient but of course our area is still car-reliant). He was spending quite a bit on Ubers and she knew he was trying to save up to move out. She has been very quiet of course lately but even she’s admitted she feels betrayed. Luis was the first person other than her parents to hold, and even be told about, lettie. He used to give Jaime money to take Lucy out on dates and watch Lettie, they were so close and now might never talk again. Lettie asks about him every day and it’s killing me. I was not lying, I would truly and honestly give an organ to magically fix this.\n\n**OOP on attending Luis and Jessa\'s wedding**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We will not be attending, Cyril does not want to but wants to avoid further drama and Luis is putting a lot of pressure on him. He doesn’t want anything worse to happen, but won’t be taking pictures after or going to the reception.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Luis confronted Lucy](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rhaenalicent777/s/rwluKjP7i3): **September 1, 2025 (2.5 weeks later from the previous update)**\n\nI don’t really know why I’m posting here but kind of want to get it off my chest I guess. Jaime is out of town this weekend for a bachelors party so it’s just been the four of us. Yesterday I sent Lucy to take Lettie to pick out some mums because I love that little girl but I cannot bear the soda pop song again lol.\n\nBut Luis came up to her at the garden center and apparently started ranting at her about Jaime, as if Lucy herself had no reason to be angry with him. Telling her that she should leave him, that he’s an asshole, and that he (Luis) is getting the tattoo that they’d both gotten together removed. Lucy doesn’t even want to tell Jaime about it because we all know he’ll just be pissed off but I told her shouldn’t hide stuff from him. I don’t know, I don’t even know if I trust my own advice these days.\n\nEdit omg I can’t believe I didn’t add the good news. I’ve been working to talk about good news more! But Cyril and Rosa put an offer on a house and it got accepted! And the best part! It’s so close - a 10 minute walk or a 3 minute drive! I knew they were looking but I had no idea they were going to make and offer! So close but not close enough to be a Marie from everybody loves Raymond ;) my husband keeps joking about how he needs to invest in homegoods because I can’t stop finding things I think they’ll like! (I get a receipt lol)\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I\'m so sorry for what you and your family are going through. It\'s hard to see a loved one go on the toxic route and have to remove yourself from them because of it. I hope he comes around soon, before it\'s too late. You are an amazing mom and grandma, don\'t forget that.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thank you. It’s just infuriating! Luis used to be so thoughtful and considerate, and apparently he just kept saying things like oh I know Jaime is angry with me and Lucy was like - *i’m* angry with you! And he had no idea why she would be. I’m so devastated.\n\n**Is there a possibility that Luis has a thing for Lucy and Jessa has suspicions about this?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I really doubt that. He’s known her since she was like 14 and he would have been almost 30. Luis isn’t like that.\n\n**Commenter 2:** She did good, no point in engaging with him in his current state of mind. But you said Lettie was there and in your previous post you mentioned how she missed him and it was a shock to suddenly not have him in her life. Did he acknowledge her this time and how is she doing now in regard to him?\n\nI assume that apart from this accidental meeting nobody has had contact with Luis recently? Is Cyril still going to be his best man? Btw congrats to them getting the house, bet you\'re looking forward to having more grandkids so near ;-)\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes he apparently acted normal and sweet to Lettie. I don’t know. I don’t know his problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyril will still be in the ceremony, but they don’t talk much. And he and Rosa are undecided about kids but just having them close will be wonderful\n\n**Commenter 3:** I\'m so sorry you\'re having to deal with this, I agree it is hard to wrap one\'s mind around the Why of it. I guess that\'s why you might feel sometimes that it\'s hard to trust your own judgement / advice, but from all you have been writing here I think you are really doing the best that can be done in the circumstances.\n\nNot sure what to think of Cyril\'s involvement in the ceremony and what kind of message it sends. I remember you saying he is the drama-avoider but is him being the best man really avoiding drama in this case? You mentioned once they\'re holding sth against him and I hope this is not a big concern.\n\nPlease keep us updated. Reddit is usually pastime but I catch myself checking your profile every now and then because my heart really goes out to you and I hope for a good outcome for your family.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thank you. Yes, Cyril likes avoiding conflict but honestly it’s my youngest son that’s begging him just to do it so as not to create more drama. He’s not going to the reception or bachelor party or anything, he and Rosa have made other plans that night and Jaime and Lucy are taking Lettie to the Rocky Mountains for the weekend so none of us will be available.\n\n**When is the wedding?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Oct\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rhaenalicent777/comments/1ohhvpu/the_wedding_is_over/): **October 27, 2025 (nearly two months later)**\n\nUpdate: AITAH for not wanting to pay for my son’s rehearsal dinner because I can’t stand his fiancée?\n\nI went to post on aitah and got yelled at lol! I guess I have to post this here? Oh well! Thanks for listening to me the past few months. I lied and this will actually be my last update. The wedding was last weekend. I didn\'t go. The weather was bad but I went with my friends to the No Kings Protests. Despite the weather my city came out strong against the Trump Administration and all the pictures from around the country were beautiful to see, but I somehow don\'t feel like anything is ever going to get better. Does anyone else feel that way?\n\nFor some reason a few weeks ago I got a bunch of messages asking me what race Lucy was? My husband is from Mexico, Lucy and I are white, and Rosa\'s family is Hispanic You can figure out the rest from there.\n\nAbout a week before the wedding, Luis reached out to me, my husband, and Jaime about changing our minds about attending. He seemed better than usual, and just said that he didn\'t want anything to happen that we couldn\'t take back. Jaime and Lucy had already planned to take Lettie camping that weekend, he obviously didn\'t respond but told me he wouldn\'t blame us if we went - and he wouldn\'t know. I don\'t think he was trying to be manipulative, I know he\'s hurting over all of this. I did think about it a lot, Luis is still my son and even though I don\'t like him at all, I still love him and do want him to be happy. But - I don\'t know if it\'s stress or what, but I tried on the dress I was going to wear and it was too big. Is it bad that that was the final nail in me not going? I mean I was 99% not going, but it was almost as if it gave me the final permission not to!\n\nCyril said it went fine. He was just there for the ceremony. Some of our family attended, but no one of the ones from out of the country. My husband doesn\'t want them coming here for a while. Which is so sad!! We always hosted them for Christmas and it\'s going to feel so lonely this year. I REALLY want to maybe go down to Mexico for the holidays but with Rosa and Jaime\'s jobs not being super flexible I don\'t think we\'ll be able to.\n\nHe *(editor\'s note: Cyril)* said folks at the wedding were talking about Jessa and Luis moving to [redacted], which is where a lot of her family is. The guy who owns the company Luis went to work for - he\'s sort of what the kids would call a frenemy of my husbands haha!!! - has been talking about opening a branch in the South so that would make sense. Please don\'t take this the wrong way, I know there are lovely people in Alabama, but one of my dear friends in my prayer group is from [redacted] and has told me it is still a violently racist place. She is black and I know there are other elements going on down there but it makes me so anxious. \n\nThere is good news for us! Cyril and Rosa closed on their house. My husband and Jaime have been over there most nights helping fix some stuff up. Cyril has been wanting to propose for a while, and he asked me to go ring shopping with him soon. Rosa knows, she has sent him a variety of rings she likes but wants to be surprised. I have some family heirlooms he could pick from, but none of them look like what she’s looking for, so I told him I would either give him one to have redesigned or money towards the new one. Some of you might be mad about that but whatever. Life is short and it’s my money. \n\nLucy also was able to get credit for her internship this summer, which is exciting because it means she can graduate a semester early in the spring! Unfortunately between that and Cyril’s house Jaime has been on one about them moving into a place of their own. Which I KNOW they are adults and a family and I can’t do anything about it, but I so wish they’d stay for a few more years. I just don’t think they’d be happy renting? There’s an older couple a few blocks over who I bring communion to and they’ve been talking about moving in with their daughter, but they don’t want their house to be sold to an investment company or anything. I told my husband that we could buy it as an investment and they could rent from us but he told me he was going to send me to busybody jail and that a crappy rental apartment won’t kill them. \n\nI guess I also know that a lot of living in this house reminds Jaime (and Lucy and Lettie but it’s affecting him most) of Luis, but all of this really has shown me that you don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t regret anything I’ve ever done for my children, and I’m not going to stop helping them. My husband and I are in a good place moneywise, and we won’t be able to take it with us. \n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Thank you so much for updating. Nothing really came as a surprise, but still I’m somehow taken aback that there wasn’t a different kind of resolution. Don’t know how to explain it rationally, really. I am sorry that she managed to alienate him so much and in this prospective move near her family it will cement it all. Really sorry, OP, that he didn’t come around.\n\nYour heart can hurt but it can also rest assured you did all right and all you could have in the circumstance. So much more joy to come around in your family! I wish you all well.\n\nBusybody jail is an awesome term! :D So good to have someone keep us grounded by making us laugh at the same time!\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I am sorry he didn’t come around, too. I don’t know if him apologizing would have made a difference to Jaime at this point, but maybe it would have. But he didn’t so it didn’t matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, I am a regular visitor to busybody jail!\n\n**Commenter 2:** Thank you for sharing. It\'s good the wedding went well. I hope him and his wife can find some kind of peace. I\'m sorry your family had to go through all this, but it seems like it all worked out in it\'s own way. You are a good mom, and your kids are lucky to have you. Your kids sound awesome too. It sucks that it doesn\'t always work out though. It is what it is. I think buying the neighbors house isn\'t a bad idea lol, but I know it\'ll be hard when they finally move out. Enjoy the time you have with them- it all goes by way too fast. Good luck to your family, and thanks for sharing your story.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thank you. I do hope they find peace and happiness, even if it means I won’t be there to see it. It’s all we can want for our kids in the end. I will keep praying on it until I’m gone, but of course my dream is for everybody to make up somehow. I know it’s unlikely, but crazier things have happened!\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah I’m not going to drop the house thing. It’s a nice house! It needs quite a few updates but kind of like Cyril and Rosa’s house, it’s not so close that we’d just pop by constantly but would be close enough that we could be there in minutes if needed. Plus Lettie will be attending grandma daycare for a few more years and she would NOT appreciate a long commute 😂 we’ll see.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I know how hard it is to have a family member alienated by a new spouse. Your heart aches and breaks with every new event when your family is fractured. Nothing is ever going to be the same and no amount of argument or persuasion will change that.\n\nI recommend counseling to help you get through this process. It took me several years to stop trying to \"fix\" things I had zero control over. Until Luis decides he misses your family and makes the necessary changes, you are powerless. Focus on the family who wants you in their lives. Make new traditions. Step outside your comfort zone. Learn to let go, but tell Luis you will leave the door cracked open if he wants to reconnect. Just don\'t expect it.\n\nFWIW, I think buying your church members home is a marvelous idea! Investing in a home is always a good thing.\n\nBTW, our family member did come back about 10 years later. The relationship isn\'t the same, but at least we communicate. Good luck!\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thank you, I’m glad your family member and you are in communication, I’m sure it can never be the same. I am in counseling, and it helps a lot!\n&gt; \n&gt; I do hope we end up buying the house. They obviously know me and Lettie usually comes with me, so that could help them with them being afraid that the house would go to a corporation. And of course we’d pay a fair price! We have Cyril and Rosa money for their home so they could get a better rate, so nobody could complain. Not that they would just saying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1on36kk/final_new_update_aitah_if_we_dont_pay_for_my_sons/', 2630, 474, '2025-11-03 12:04:05', '2025-11-07 23:43:30');

We\'ll call the fiancée \"Diane\" - she\'s 39F. They\'ve been together almost 5 years.\n\nFirst of all, my brother isn\'t the sharpest tool in the shed. He has fallen for lie after lie (and still doesn\'t really see the lies) and years of her fake persona and manipulative behavior. For example, she lied that she couldn\'t get pregnant in the beginning - literally said her uterus has been removed (then why are you having a period, psycho?!) They now have a 4 year old and a 2 year old. Still, these were \"miracle pregnancies.\"  She told him him they were ectopic tube pregnancies. \n\nApparently my bro cannot use Google, nor does he believe countless family and friends who told him this was impossible to give birth from an ectopic pregnancy. He works a lot and never was able to get to an OB appointment, and even if he did, he likely wouldn\'t have asked the doc. In the end, he said he loves her and it doesn\'t matter. Okay dude....fine. We\'ll be happy for you and our new nephews.\n\nNeedless to say, I am (and much of our family) are not fond of Diane. She is a user of the highest order, disposing of people like Kleenex once their usefulness has expired. I\'ve watched her manipulate my parents, my bro, my sister, her own friends and family... it\'s just been gross when I\'ve had to deal with her at family holiday events, weddings, funerals.... just ew.\n\nNow, they are finally getting married next weekend. They\'ve been planning this for about 6 months as she is a HUGE Halloween fanatic, but doesn\'t want to share her anniversary with Halloween day. It\'s not a huge event, about 50 people... mostly our family and some of hers.\n\nHer brother, his wife, and 4 kids cannot afford a hotel. This is something Diane has known about for months, but just asked me last night if they could stay with us since I have the biggest house. This is an unreasonable (and undesirable) situation for me for a multitude of reasons:\n\n1 - I live almost 3 hours away from the venue and the town they will be hosting events such as final dress fittings, rehearsal dinner, bachelor and Bachelorette parties.... that will be a lot of back and forth for them especially since my kids and I (plus my +1) are only invited to the wedding and reception. They couldn\'t even carpool with us because we aren\'t attending those events.\n\n2 - Kids under 13 are not invited to the wedding or reception - assuming all the adults (and my teens) will be at the wedding - who\'s going to watch their kids (1,4,5, and 9) and where will they go during the festivities? My kids are attending their Uncle\'s wedding - we\'re going to support my brother and see our other family members. So, if the plan is to see if I or one my kiddos (17, 16, and 15) will do it, the answer is \"No.\"\n\n3 - I have met these people ONCE in passing. I know nothing about them at all, and if they\'re anything like their sister, well.... I don\'t want to. Aside from that, there\'s the whole \"trusting strangers in my home with my kids,\" as well. Nope.\n\n4 - Why exactly can\'t they stay with Diane\'s parents? They have a 3 bedroom home and live alone. Why can\'t they host their son and grandchildren? (Answer: He and his dad don\'t get along, and since her dad is the only decent person in her family that I have met and liked, that\'s a red flag for me.)\n\nI told Diane and my brother that I really am not comfortable with this, and the response was \"Please? It\'s family!\" Ughhhh.\n\nMy boyfriend (weird to say bf at my age 😅) said he would stay with us all weekend if I was uncomfortable having them there alone, and would help out since I will also be expected to properly host which means cooking for everyone, etc. That\'s great, and would help with the \"uncomfortable\" part, for sure. But even still, aside from the trust issues I have, I am primarily worried about where their kids will be during everything. The response was \"We\'re still figuring that out.\" After that, I double downed on the \"No \" since I have visions of them saying the 9 year old could babysit 1,4, and 5 year old at my house.\n\nMy family is 50/50 on me being an AH about it, and Diane\'s family (except her parents) also think I\'m being an AH since it is \"just one weekend\" and I usually host all the holidays and such. They say I am being a snob about it, and I\'m out of touch because I cannot appreciate their financial struggles. Jfc - up until a decade ago, I was exactly in their shoes monetarily. I don\'t care thst they don\'t have Bezos money. I care that they are strangers, someone in my house will likely be expected to babysit and miss the ceremony or be expected to babysit all weekend while their parents are out partying, and the fact that there is family tension between them and their parents is giving me anxiety about what I can expect from my potential guests. Am I being an asshole?\n\n*UPDATE* I have been getting bombarded with calls and texts from Diane and my brother - which I ignored until about an hour ago. I calmly asked \"What\'s up?\" when I answered. I could hear the panic in her voice as she rushed to berate me for being so cruel while she had so much else to deal with. Lady, I work full time, travel for work, have 2 kids playing high school football, have 2 kids who have part-time jobs, and I am a single mom - I don\'t exactly have an easy schedule and free time myself.\n\nShe went on to say that she had been \"so sure\" that I would be willing to \"help\" (read: babysit her family that no one else wants around, it seems) that she already promised them they could stay in the pool house. (Let\'s be clear the \"pool house\" has a bathroom, a large living area, and a tiny kitchenette. It\'s barely the size of a primary bedroom, let alone big enough for 6 people. It\'s not some extravagant space).\n\nI told her, \"Sorry, but that\'s not my problem. You should have asked first. I also have the kids and I booked at the XYZ hotel because I plan to drink at the wedding, and I\'m not driving home after that. How did you plan to get them to my house anyway? Are they renting a car? Who\'s babysitting? Why can\'t your parents take the kids if the issue is with your brother? Why would he bring them if he couldn\'t afford it anyway? This is something seriously poor planning!\" I fired those questions off at her like bullets out of a gun. She said this was dumped on her, and she was stuck. I said, \"So you thought I was the best choice to dump this on to take it off your plate? We aren\'t exactly close, Diane. Please stop asking me, I\'m not going to do this for you. My answer is final. Sorry, not sorry.\"\n\nWe\'re uninvited to the wedding. 😂😂😂😂 I don\'t believe my brother will allow that, but if it comes to pass that we don\'t get to go - good riddance!\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** You are absolutely Not the asshole here and I wouldn\'t let them into my house either.\n\n What if the kids steal your jewelry? What\'s to prevent the adults from going through your papers and stealing your identity? Best case scenario is that they eat everything in your house drink all your alcohol and leave you a major mess to clean up.\n\n Its your home. \n\nIf they\'re struggling so much financially, why are they coming? \n\nIts one thing to host an adult couple, but this is a whole pack of people who will expect you to host, and pay their way.  And probably use your car. \n\nWhy aren\'t they grandkids staying with Diane\'s parents , if the issue is with the son? There\'s something fishy here. \n\nThese are complete strangers whose own family don\'t want to host them. Why should you??\n\nStand your ground, lady. No means NO. And maybe the family members who don\'t like your decision can take them in. \n\n&gt; **OOP:** I agree with all of this...and it\'s why the situation is giving me pause. I have even considered offering to pay for 2 hotel rooms for them near the wedding venue, but I know that will get twisted back around me being a terrible person who is \"above her family\" or some shit....or likely set a precedent that I\'ll pay for things and solve their problems.\n\n**Commenter 2:** I love that \"please, it\'s family.\" Well it\'s not OP\'s family so that doesn\'t count.\n\nNTA. I think you\'re really smart not letting yourself be manipulated. Of course, she\'ll probably get everyone she can to hound you, so just stay off social media and text \"not your concern\" to anyone who texts you or sends e-mailed guilt trips.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Oh yes! That\'s already happening - the hounding. 😅 I am proud of myself for not snapping anyone\'s f***ing head off yet. I REALLY just want to book them a hotel, but then again, that\'s still ME solving their problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I texted my other brother (who lives out of state) and asked him where he is staying when he comes into town. They have a hotel in that town. I am currently in the process of begging him and his family to come stay with me 😂😂😂 I think I may have averted this \"crisis.\"\n\n**What about a hotel near the venue? Cheaper than a 3-hour drives for the brother and his family**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** God, yes...not to mention, they would need to rent a car if they stayed out at my place. If they stayed in a cheap hotel in town, they would be able to catch rides to events and whatnot with their local family members. Seems so simple to me. Gotta say, I am curious af about why their family has blackballed them, and who in the hell I pissed off that my punishment is being the \"chosen one\" to deal with them! It\'s not happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many have a valid point that even we aren\'t going to want to drive 3 hours home after the wedding and reception. I booked us rooms for the night of wedding.\n\n**OOP on having security for her house if the family tries to show up**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Fortunately, our road has a gate, and before the gate was put on the road last season, our driveway had a gate (we live in touristy area in the summer)....they won\'t get too close and I plan to ignore my phone. I would feel like the most horrible person to turn kids away at night, but I can do it if necessary. I suppose I should text Diane and be very clear that if they show up, they will be stuck. There are no taxis, most places to stay are Airbnbs or small bed and breakfast type places - if they cannot afford the Days Inn near the venue town, no way they can afford one of those places around here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, I\'ll get in touch with her dad. I know he or his wife will make it understood to them. And if they show in the area - ignore ignore ignore.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/qZmIkE9vU0): **October 22, 2025 (one week later)**\n\n**UPDATE** AITAH for telling my soon to be SIL I won\'t host her some of her family for her wedding?\n\nOriginal post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/em8JXZI2X6\n\nSo, my STBSIL called me and invited us back to the wedding today (wedding is Saturday).... I could tell it was a very forced action on her part - not an ounce of sincerity in her \"apology\" nor any mention that she was in the wrong save for \"overreacting in the heat of the moment.\"\n\nI had already spoken to my kiddos about what they wanted to do and their thoughts on it if they were to re-invite us - and they were of the same mindset as me - F*** that. So we made other plans for the weekend. I passed this along to her and she had the audacity to say, \"OH well, then you guys can babysit, right?\" I literally laughed and told her to fuck off.\n\nShe started crying and saying that I never gave her a chance, I\'ve always been so mean to her, and she doesn\'t know what she\'s ever done to me....blah, blah, blah. I (not so gently) acknowledged that I never gave her the opportunity to pull the wool over my eyes because I am smarter than her, BUT I have watched her quietly manipulate almost everyone in my family in some way or another. My brother is angry with her because we\'re not coming, and it was her responsibility to \"make it right,\" and she completely blew it.\n\nTo be fair - my bro hasn\'t communicated to me once personally about the incident, and that kinda pisses me off, too. Like - you couldn\'t tell me you don\'t feel the same, and you would like us to come? I\'ve got my dad saying \"Of course he wants you guys there. He is so pissed at Diane.\" Pfffft.... mmmk, Pops.\n\nSo, that\'s all folks - we\'ll be spending our weekend at the Michigan vs Michigan State football game and tailgating with the best fans in the state! #HAIL #GOBLUE\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Other than saying she didn’t believe she could have children over 5 years ago, which really is none of your business, how has she caused family drama? How has she manipulated people? You’re NTA because you can decide who can and can’t stay at your house, but you do come off as a cold bitch who probably didn’t give her a chance.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** This isn\'t a \"she didn\'t believe she could have them and lucked out..\" type of situation. She baby trapped my brother by saying she had her uterus removed. No one without a uterus can ever get pregnant...and an ectopic pregnancy is a one in a million fallopian tube pregnancy that results in the death of the fetus and possible death for the mother. Neither of these things are POSSIBLE at all. There was no misunderstanding- she lied and manipulated him. Mone of my business? Maybe not - but it surely shows the type of person she is.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did give her an honest try - she wasn\'t my cup of tea for sure, but I didn\'t give up on her until the baby drama and all that has transpired since.\n&gt; \n&gt; She told my parents she has stage 3 ovarian cancer, but her insurance wouldn\'t allow her to pursue treatment unless she had a dedicated care person - my dad quit is his job to provide that for her. There were all kinds of mishaps- he never got training, never got paid, etc etc. 3 months later - she admitted she didn\'t have cancer, just didn\'t wanna be alone all the time. So my dad took an early retirement for nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don\'t know how many times she asked one of my kids to babysit with pay, and then never paid them.... twice, there was no food in the house, and my daughter had to order DoorDash to feed my nephew. In itself...not an issue, but don\'t lie - just say \"I can\'t afford to pay you, but could you help me out?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; She told her boss that she was missing so much work because her fiancé is a drug addict and abusive towards the kids, so she takes off the days when he doesn\'t work to protect her kids if he is high. Of course, her employer called CPS. Turns out SHE was the one with a drug issue. She went to rehab, and all is well in the world again. 🙄\n&gt; \n&gt; The list goes on and on... if she says the sky is blue, you damned well better look out the window and check for yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadly, my brother chalks all this up to her struggling with addiction \"but she\'s sober now and better\" according to him. For what it\'s worth, she\'s still a shit person.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that makes me cold-hearted - then so be it.\n\n**Commenter 2:** I hope they don\'t know where you live and try to break into your home or something stupid like that.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Well, fortunately, our home has a gated drive and security system. AND this past spring, the township we live in turned our road into a private/gated road due to many issues with summer tourists. Initially, I had considered removing our gate because it seemed like overkill, but now it seems like a blessing in disguise. Lol\n\n**Commenter 3:** she just sounds like a right pain. have a great weekend away from her mess.\n\nalso, her lack of effort in the apology - not to mention re-inviting you days before the wedding is just childish. good luck to your brother.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes! He\'s gonna need it.\n\n**Commenter 4:** NTA yeah, your brother told her to “fix it” and handed his balls off in the process. And your dad’s enabling his bullshit.\n\nThis is peak Reddit advice by a mile but don’t be surprised if they try to leave the kids at your door under the guise of “you’re not coming so you’re free…” or some shit like that. Get a doorbell camera/camera that aims at the entrance to your house so if she pulls that particular brand of bullshit, you call the cops and say that you’re in East Lansing [I am a college football fan myself] and did not consent to the kids being dropped off and nope.\n\nGo have fun at the game.

My Sister in Law, Amy has twin girls that will be 12 months old and a 6 year old Son.\n\nPrior to the Twins being born I had a conversation with Amy, where she said to me she was looking forward to knowing at the 12 month mark there would be a child free evening where she could let loose and she didn’t want her kids there. I said that we would love to have her 6-year-old as the flower boy and we agreed that he would be part of the ceremony and then be driven the short distance home to join his sisters with a baby sitter during the reception.\n\nFast forward to now. Amy is shopping for dresses for the twins for the wedding day. I was confused to hear about it and asked why. Amy seems to have forgotten our conversation and wants her twins at the wedding. I’ve been gentle but I have said that it was only the 6-year-old that was planned to be there and I wasn’t too keen on the younger kids being there.\n\nMother in Law and Sister in Law are upset with my future husband and I about this decision. MIL has pushed for the “whole family” to be in the photographers family portraits on the day as the “whole family” will be together and dressed nice.\n\nSister in Law has said “your family deserves to be at your wedding” and has also said she doesn’t want the six-year-old to be attending events without the twins because he has had trouble adjusting to them and is always asking to leave them behind- SIL doesn’t want to encourage that behaviour by having him attend anything without them. And so she has said that either all her kids come or none will.\n\nThis conversation was tense and I am very conflict avoidant. I left it there, unresolved.\n\nFuture husband doesn’t want the Twins there as they do summon a considerable amount of attention and he wants people focused on us.\n\nI don’t really care if they are there or not, but I do feel like I’ve been dismissed by SIL and MIL and they’ve tried to change plans without letting me know and then tried to guilt trip me when I called it out, now it kind of feels like an ultimatum is being set and the whole attitude around it has me wanting to put my foot down and push back.\n\nFH and I have offered up some compromises. We are having a gathering with all the same people the night before the wedding and all their side of the family will be around for the morning after the wedding, we the twins would be so welcome there and we would be able to get some great photos and have time together but we would still have our wedding be childfree (with exception of flower boy). But this was completely dismissed.\n\nI just want to know if I’m overreacting by saying they can’t attend.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** It’s your wedding and SIL and MIL should have been more respectful about how they approached you about these concerns.\n\nThat having been said, I would gently suggest that you and your fiancé may want to rethink how you’re handling this. It is unusual to invite one child and not other siblings, and I don’t follow the concern about 12-month old twins stealing attention from you. If you hold firm—which is absolutely within your right—it means there will possibly be lingering hard feelings with your SIL and MIL going forward and that you need to be okay with that. Just my $.02.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes, I know it’s weird to invite just one sibling. That’s just how that original conversation landed and it made sense at the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have a DIY venue and in keeping things budget we have family and friends helping out with a few things. Amy’s husband was given the job of dog minder for our large dog, MIL was to be performing a wedding coordinator type role. We feel like that’s a lot to handle if you’re chasing around twins.\n&gt; \n&gt; It’s not so much about stealing any spotlight, it’s more about things running smoothly. Hope that makes a bit more sense.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 2:** Hold up. Your large dog will be there and needs a handler. The handler is the father of the twins. The twins can’t attend because *they will be a distraction*, but I think the dog must also be a distraction that requires a handler.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If I were Amy, I’d be upset that my husband was assigned “dog duty” and then we were told our kids weren’t welcome. I just don’t think you can ask people to DIY it for you so you can save money, and then also tell the unpaid labor to pay for a babysitter so you can have your preferred child free wedding. It sounds to me like Amy’s family is providing a lot (flower boy, dog wrangler, and possibly more?) and you/your fiancé aren’t being very considerate of that.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Yeah, I get what you’re saying and that looks really poorly on us from that angle, which is probably exactly how they would see things.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Our dog is a fun addition but not all THAT important. This has been the plan for the last 8 months or so, because of the decision Amy made to not have her twins there.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Changing that decision is totally up for discussion, and would change our plans with the dog handler job. I’d be willing to hire a dog handler to keep her there, no dramas. The drama comes from Amy choosing to have her twins there, when this plan has been in place since before they were born and she didn’t care to ask us if a change of plan was cool.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I would compromise and agree that \"OK. No kids whatsoever then\" and go without a \"flower boy\".\n\nI almost feel like a 6yo little boy would be just as much of a loud distraction as two 1yos and your entire wedding is child free anyways so it would be odd that one single small child is the exception to that. Just avoid the whole thing and leave all the kids out of it.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes I feel like that’s a great option. Totally unfair on the 6-year-old though, as he’s been told all about it and is so excited. I don’t want to do that to the poor kid.\n\n**OOP should get her fiancé to deal with his mother and sister**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We are working on this together. This post is from my perspective, for the purpose of sharing it with him in a moment.\n\n**OOP responds to a comment on her FH wanting time and space to have his parents\' full attention for the wedding, and not being distracted by the twins**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** You’re spot on. FH and I have given a lot to his parents, so they can be around to help with the grandkids. We have had them living in our home for the past 5 years because we live close to SIL. What that means is for the past 5 years every outing, event or conversation has revolved entirely around these three children. It’s become quite difficult for us and FH wants one day that’s not about them.\n&gt; \n&gt; There’s obviously other reasons too but this is for sure a contributing factor.\n\n**Commenter 4:** \"I don’t really care if they are there or not\" - if you don\'t really care, then allow them to be at the ceremony and in the pictures then go to a babysitter for the reception. Ultimately and years down the road, you may find that you are happy you have pictures with all of the family in them.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** This is the easy option for sure. But it’s not just me. FH is dead set against it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I get why, our lives have all revolved around these kids for such a long time. The MIL and FIL have lived with us for the past 5 years because we live so close to SIL and they want to be around the help. But especially in the last 6 months we have been asking them to sort out their living plans long term as we don’t want them with us forever and we are starting our married life, planning our own family and there’s a lot on hold waiting for them to leave. The twins are their excuse to stay, while paying no rent, no groceries, no bills.\n&gt; \n&gt; “But the twins need us”\n&gt; \n&gt; It’s true but it’s also made FH resentful. And me a bit too.\n&gt; \n&gt; FH wants a day that doesn’t revolve around them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/0wZM2wkOGN): **August 28, 2025 (a bit over one month later)**\n\nUpdate to: 12 month old nieces are not invited. SIL and MIL are arguing\n\nSo, FH and I were invited to the twins first birthday was this week. As much as I knew this was NOT the right time or place to have a discussion about a tense topic involving the exclusion of these two babies, it came up.\n\nContext: one week ago, FH spoke to his BIL (father of the twins) and again said that the babies were not invited to the wedding. I wasn\'t there and don\'t have further context on how this came up or how the conversation was handled/received.\n\nWhen we were around the dinner table for the birthday get together, FH left the room for one minute. That was the moment SIL said to me, \"I\'d like to check with you about what FH said about the wedding, He said the babies weren\'t invited to the ceremony or reception... So... is that right?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, that\'s our plan\".\n\n(This is not news to her, see last post, this has been my stance since before these kids were born).\n\nI excused myself shortly after and made myself busy in another room. FH sat at the table and apparently laid down the law with his family over this and some other issues. We left shortly after but before we went SIL said to me \"I respect that this is what you want but I am really upset.\"\n\nPart of me feels so guilty that I\'ve upset her. Part of me is annoyed and perplexed by her apparent shock at this information... as if we didn\'t have this conversation a month ago.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** She’s allowed to be upset and have feelings about it. As long as that sentence means she’ll drop it, I would just assume this topic is closed.\n\nMake no other mention of it unless they bring it up again.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That\'s my plan. This has been put out there. Clear as crystal. No confusion. I will just be on edge expecting petty comments. I guess I have to be ok with that. I have hurt her feelings.\n\n**Commenter 2:** You really should have said, in front of everyone, “like we talked about back (whatever month), our plan has been no babies, drive the six year old home after the wedding. You said you were looking forward to a night without the kids?”\n\nBet you a dollar they’re trying to get free “fancy” Family portraits out of the deal. I’d be tempted to let them, and then not give them the photos of just their family- “oh, we didn’t have the photographer touch up EVERY photo. You can call them and buy those photos yourself.”\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I did hear her say to FH something like \"those photos are for a lifetime\".\n&gt; \n&gt; her babies being in the photos has come up several times. I don\'t understand that. These kids won\'t feel any attachment to an event that they don\'t remember from when they were 1.\n\n**Commenter 3:** *Part of me feels so guilty that I\'ve upset her*\n\nThis would be a good feeling for you to examine. You seem to be taking on responsibility for her feelings. Why is that? Meanwhile, she seems to have no regard for your feelings. What is the basis of your guilt?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** hmm. I mean.. I\'m actually impressed with how she handled things in that moment. letting me know she was upset but also that she respected the decision. I don\'t feel as though she had no regard for my feelings.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for me feeling responsible for her feelings. I feel that way because I made a choice that hurt her feelings, that IS my responsibility.\n\n**What is OOP\'s plan if her SIL shows up to the wedding with the twins?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I have a feeling FH will have dealt with that before I make my way down the aisle\n\n**Commenter 4:** Please tell your FSIL that she and her hubby had their day. This one is about you and your FH. Actually, she and FMIL know the \'twins\' will be the center of attention, and that\'s what they want. They want to show off to the rest of the family. The next thing we will see on here is that SIL &amp; MIL won\'t attend if babies aren\'t invited. That\'s when you and FH need to stand together and tell them that they will be missed, and when people ask, you will tell the truth that MIL wants her golden child to be the center of attention at your wedding. If you back down this time, that\'s how your whole life will be. Stand firm.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** FH also told me MIL said to him that this may be the only chance they get to introduce the twins to some elderly extended family that live 1.5 hours away.\n&gt; \n&gt; I personally feel as though if they can make it down for a wedding between a person they haven\'t met (Me) and someone they haven\'t seen in a decade (FH), they can make it down to meet the kids, if they cared to meet them.\n\n**Is OOP still planning to have the twins\' father handle her dog?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I think with all the tenseness between us all now, I will be asking someone else.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATES----\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/NVuGjaEe1I): **September 29, 2025 (one month later)**\n\nUpdate #2 to: 12 month old nieces are not invited, SIL and MIL are arguing.\n\nOk, welcome back all. Quick rehash. My FH *(editor’s note: future husband)* has a sister, she has twin babies that are 1 year old. Since before they were born the decision was made that they would not attend FH and Is wedding. MIL, their very involved grandmother and SIL, their mother have refused to accept this as reality and continually argue over it and seem to forget previous conversations.\n\nOn to the update - we are now just 4 sleeps away from the wedding. I should be feeling so excited. But the entire energy has been completely crushed by these two women. \n\nFHs grandmother (MIL mother) arrived two days ago to stay with us in our home during the festivities. Last night we all sat at the table for dinner - not common in our house we usually eat in front of the TV but as we had a guest I didn’t think it was weird. Dinner finished and we were having a pleasant chat mostly about some incoming visitors sleeping arrangements and airport pick ups, just logistical things. \n\nThen MIL said “one more thing - what can I do to make you more comfortable with the babies being there”.\n\nNo lie I felt my heart rate spike instantly. \n\nI said “we are NOT comfortable with the babies being there”\n\nMIL the asked a bunch of questions about our timeline and wrote down the times we would be going off for photos. I said to her “we said the babies cannot come, that includes the time we will not be there” \n\nShe said “I’m just trying to find a way for the babies to meet everyone, everyone’s been saying to me they are so excited to meet these bubs and I’m sick of having the same conversation with them all”\n\nI said” you are trying to find a way to get what you want at our wedding. The babies had a first birthday recently, you could have invited people to that, their mother doesn’t work, she’s had a year to organise introducing these babies to anyone who wants to. You don’t have to wait for a wedding or a funeral for a family meeting”\n\nShe said “that’s just it, it’s a family wedding”\n\nI said “no, it’s our wedding, the family is invited to celebrate with us, eat dinner, cake and dance if they want to”\n\nThrow out this back and forth the grandmother was piping in with: \n\nthese are your nieces. \n\nYou’re having a dog there but not you sisters children.\n\nThe 6 year old wants his sisters there.\n\nI said “he is six. He doesn’t get what he wants. \n\nThis went on for a bit before I said conversation over and stormed off. \n\nLet’s see how the next 4 days go. FML.\n\nEdit to add: FH was at the table too. Also saying the same things as me. He’s been saying the same things all along. We have each other’s backs.\n\n**Some of OOP\'s Relevant Comments**\n\n**Why isn\'t OOP\'s fiancé handling the family?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** My bad - FH was right there with me at the table. He was 100% with me fighting this fight.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 1:** He needs to tell both of them if they bring it up again they are no longer invited. Will he tell his sister to leave if she shows up with the babies? This is so weird by the way. Why are they expecting your wedding to be the time everyone meets them? Why hasn’t anyone met these babies before?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Right. They’ve had a year. If they cared to meet them, they could have. We’re talking about people who live a 2 hour drive away. It’s not around the corner but not an impossible feet.\n\n**Commenter 2:** You’re having a dog there?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes, our dog.\n\n**OOP responds to multiple comments about having her dog and a six-year-old at the wedding, but not the twins**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I don’t get it. We can invite whoever we want. We are talking about babies. Everyone is better off- including the babies - if they are not there. Everyone will be more present if they’re not chasing down small children intent on hurting themselves.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I know that this isn’t a common take. Yes it is your wedding. But at the end of the day it’s about joining your two families together. Is it really worth dying on this hill? If the 6yo is coming, I don’t understand what the problem with kids is. I mean yeah it’s your special day, but people take themselves way too seriously. You have to live with these people for the rest of your lives is it really worth the animosity?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes. 100% it is worth it to us. His family have crossed every boundary and helicopter our lives. This is one line that we will hold and it’s on our wedding day- the one day we get to be in the right regardless of the decision.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Editor\'s note: the body text for the latest update was saved before it got deleted**\n\n[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/u/Everlasting-Sunshine/s/EnRSVA4F2G): **October 4, 2025 (five days later)**\n\nUpdate #3 to : 12 months old twin nieces are not invited. MIL and SIL are arguing\n\nThis will be a quick one. I’m sure there will be more updates in the future. \n\nWe got married!! It was a great day and night and despite all the drama, the wedding was awesome.\n\nOnto the juicy stuff….\n\nThere’s been a few things happen this week. Everyday has been its own adventure. Tuesday, I walk into my kitchen and find SIL. She does not have a key and did not let me know she was coming by. She did what she came over to do and I sent her a text very politely saying if she needs to come by for something and can see my car is there, just knock and I’ll greet you at the door. Well, she didn’t like that. All communication with her since she has used very corporate language and at one point called me a stranger and not family.\n\nOn Thursday morning I was informed that MIL, SIL, GMIL, FIL, the sisters/ aunts and kids would not be attending our house for the pre-wedding get together BBQ on Friday night, as they were going to do their own party at SIL house for a family member who had had a birthday on another day that week. We pushed back hard and told them they’d better come to this event we had been planning for over 6months, because the whole event was invented for them to have their family reunion they wanted. All the food had been purchased. They reluctantly agreed. They showed up late and not hungry. Turns out they had done their little get together for lunch at SILs house. \n\nThere wasn’t enough chairs for everyone so the families mine/his were separated inside and outside. We should have had enough chairs to all sit outside. I checked my cameras…. They had taken the extra chairs to SILs house for their lunch, and not returned them.\n\nThe extended family on his side decided not to attend the venue as planned to assist with set up on the Friday , as they had been at SILs lunch. Hubs and I did it all ourselves. It’s a blank venue so there was a lot of work and we had planned on having a dozen helpers.\n\nAs far as I know, there were no babies at the venue at any time. They were invited to attend the venue prior to the ceremony, so they could get family photos, photographer and all, but they chose not to.\n\nFlower kid did a terrible job but we were still so proud of him, he looked fantastic and we were glad he was there. \n\nSIL refused to stand in family photos until an Aunt literally pushed her. \n\nMIL did not say one word to me all day. No “hello”, no “congratulations”, no “see ya”. \n\nThe babysitter was sick. SIL left straight after the ceremony with flower boy and went home to care for kids. Her husband stuck around all night talking to everyone about how he wants to open his marriage and SIL gave him permission for a girlfriend….\n\nOther than him, all my husbands side of the family ate dinner and left, without a goodbye. They left before speeches, first dance or cake cutting. \n\nMIL did send me a text, explaining they left their only son’s wedding immediately after dinner because she was cold. Is was 21 degrees (Celsius) *(editor’s note: 69 degrees)*\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** What did your husband say to his family about trespassing, stealing from you, and sabotaging your event? Why did you have a BBQ instead of his family, if it was what they wanted and not you? Everyone in this dynamic is exhausting. I don\'t know that I could have gone through with it myself.\n\nBut I\'m glad the wedding went well despite the nonsense! Congratulations to you and your husband! I hope your next update is the two of you moving far away from these people.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** They aren’t trespassing as the MIL &amp; FIL live in our house. SIL was given a key by her mother to enter the house. Totally understandable, I’m just asking her to give me a heads up before she actually enters the house. I just didn’t like thinking I was alone in the house and seeing someone who I know has not been given a key standing in my kitchen. Like, shoot a text or if I’m literally at the house, just knock. Then I can greet you, we could even chat and exchange pleasantries.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don’t even mind them taking the chairs. Any other day that’s fine we have two dozen, need a chair, take a chair- but not the day I’m having a gathering and if you do… bring them back with you.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am so open to criticism on this one. I’m struggling to see the other side of this one.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Congratulations\n\nGet MIL &amp; FIL out of your house. This whole thing is toxic, it\'s going to impact your well-being at some point, and who knows, possibly your marriage.\n\nJust a note - depending on where you live, 21° can be cold. I live in the Southern Hemisphere, in a place where summer lasts for months. I find anything below 35° freezing cold. I love my 40°+ days!\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Totally. 21 is cool for where we are- sub tropical. Definitely cool enough to be a little uncomfortable. We had provided blankets that were used by many people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes I agree it is cool and for some more sensitive among the group they would have been uncomfortable.\n&gt; \n&gt; … the parents of the groom actually leaving tho? Without a goodbye and just a text later on? Yikes.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 2:** I\'ll bet DH has never nay sayed his parents in his life and suddenly, for one important day, he refused to back down, and this is the payback.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Get them out of your house and change the locks. They will make your lives hell if you allow them to. Don\'t allow them to.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Sounds like solid advice. We have a few days alone now, so I think we will spend some time strategising.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; You’re absolutely right. He has never said no to them before and I think they just can’t handle the concept of him having autonomy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o3lv0a/new_updates_12monthold_twin_nieces_are_not/', 2620, 560, '2025-10-11 10:02:05', '2025-11-07 23:43:30');

I did try contacting Fletcher Dunn; but unfortunately, this was not a success(neither via email, Reddit nor Twitter).\n\n \n\n# 1: Introduction:\n\nCS:GO and CS2 operate in a server-authorative manner. User inputs, in the form of **usercommands**, must be moved from each player to the server and **game-state** information must be moved from the server to each player. This post is about how the transfer of that data differs CS2 differs from CS:GO on a higher level. Subtick movement and shooting, lag compensation and prediction do not fall under this umbrella and exist (mostly) independently of how data transmission is performed; therefore, you should not be surprised when everyone’s personal favorite to hate does not make an appearance. I will briefly mention player prediction –i.e. your gun firing or moving–, as per-frame prediction has an interesting effect on end-to-end latency of motion and because the data transmission changes affect when prediction happens. It is also relevant when talking about interpolation, which I will briefly explain.\n\nTo summarize what this post is about:\n\n* How CSGO and CS2 differ in when gamestate and user input data is sent and received between server and client.\n* How certain networking conditions can increase your latency without showing up as an increased latency on telemetry or the scoreboard\n\nWhat this post is not about:\n\n* How subtick works\n* How lag compensation works\n\nStatements that need notes or references that did not fit into the text itself are marked with one or more asterisks and expanded upon at the end of the subchapter.\n\n \n\n**1.1 Real world obstacles**\n\nNow that we have an idea of what the game has to do, namely consistently transferring usercommands and game-state information around, it is time to talk about the factors that make this more difficult.\n\nThe first one is latency. We are never just sending our data to a server and getting them back instantly. Instead, it takes time. This has implications beyond just indicating higher end-to-end latency and those have to be dealt with. For simplicity\'s sake, we can just assume that one half of latency is acquired on the way to the server and the other half on the way from the server to the client. Beyond just being an easy assumption, there is no way to know which direction took how long. It makes, quite literally, no difference.\\*\n\nTo get around the fundamental effects of latency, namely that knowing the final player state after some set of actions depends on getting the result back from the server, both games use prediction. So while the server gets the last say and will correct the clients prediction if needed, the client will generally predict up to as many ticks ahead as it takes to get feedback on (and one more in CS2, more on that at the end of 3.3).\n\nUnfortunately, packets also don’t always take the same time to get from A to B. Jitter might make packets arrive late, possibly even later than the next packet in the chain. Some level of jitter is always unavoidable and therefore has to be accounted for. Jitter can occur asymmetrically, that is, affect the route to the server more than the route to the client or vice versa. I will differentiate between micro-jitter, small, natural amounts of latency variance between packets, and macro-jitter, sudden congestion that might make individual packets arrive very late. That is, macro-jitter consists of lag-spikes, while micro-jitter is just expected variance. More on macro-jitter in a bit.\n\nThere is also packet-loss. Losing packets creates obvious issues. A usercommand might get dropped for example and the inputs never reach the server. We might also not hear a certain sound because the game state information never arrived. If you ever had a flash explode without sound in CS:GO, it was in all likelihood a result of a packet being lost. Macro-jitter can also effectively act as loss, which is why I differentiated it from micro-jitter. If a packet arrives so late that its usefulness expired, it might as well have gone missing. So whenever I talk of loss in this post, assume that it means both loss and macro-jitter, while jitter will only refer to micro-jitter. Loss can also occur asymmetrically.\n\nThen there is clock-drift. Imagine for a second that our client ran slower than the server. The server would try to consume more commands than are available and send out more game-states than the client would like to process. The same is true vice versa. If the client runs faster, the server will consume usercommands slower than it receives them and send out less gamestates than we want. The relationship dictating this is how fast the sending party sends relative to how fast the receiving party receives.\n\n[Fig. 1.1 - The sender \\(the server for game-state- and the client for usercommand packets\\) ticks faster than the receiver and floods the receiver \\(the client for game-state- and the server for usercommand packets\\) with more packets than desired.](https://preview.redd.it/u87zneahvxxf1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=707abe2c7a18d76e012319b4e2b707d5d48b9be9)\n\n[Fig 1.2 - The same as Fig. 1.1 but reversed. Note how the sender ticks gets closer and closer to the receiver ticks until it misses.](https://preview.redd.it/lr6fp93kvxxf1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccffb0a61fbbee7433e3e109171a21d46f777379)\n\nA changing latency can have a similar effect, though in that case an increase would cause starvation on both sides and a decrease would cause flooding on both sides.\n\nThe tick-based nature also brings a problem with it. If the game just displayed the latest player positions obtained from the server, the perceived smoothness would be quite low, as player positions would only update 64 times a second (I will assume 64 tick for the remainder of this post). The way of addressing this is through interpolation.\n\n[Vid 1.1 - light red is the full tick position, dark red is the previous full tick position, blue the interpolated position](https://reddit.com/link/1oiq4a7/video/fomw57jovxxf1/player)\n\nInstead of just updating positions instantly, both games smoothly transition from one state to the next. This, of course, means that the player positions that you see are always delayed. The moment you go past one tick, you have to have the next one already available and instead of applying it instantly do that smooth transition. In this clip, the blue circle represents a smoothed position, the stronger red circle represents the latest available position and the lighter red circle represents the previous position. On average, this means being half a tick behind when compared to just displaying the latest position. Sidenote: Complaints about “the interp being too high” are unfounded. CS2 uses the minimum value of one tick interval.\n\n \n\n\\**See: “Why no one has measured the speed of light” by Veritasium. The same principle applies here.*\n\n \n\n# 2. CSGO\n\n**2.1 Data transfer in CSGO**\n\n[Fig 2.1 - The values are arbitrary](https://preview.redd.it/1qkbtwlbwxxf1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7e386cc96410e3473bb20c51fa509fe9b56d92)\n\nCSGO works in a rather simple way. When a client tick happens, send a usercommand to the server. Then have the server wait for the next tick to process it and send game state information back. The client will process it on the next client tick after receiving it. Sending, client prediction and processing incoming game state information are all done on one combined client tick.\n\nAs indicated at the bottom, in this case, if we shot someone and the server calculated said hit, the result would take 3 full ticks to be displayed on our end. A note on prediction: If the server takes in our usercommand and gets to a different conclusion, like when we are being shot and therefore slowed, we will only know after 3 ticks in this case. The client would then repredict all the client ticks that followed the one that the server corrected and update the current player position.\n\nDo Note: Client ticks only run on frames. This graphic can be interpreted as the actual time represented by those ticks. That means that how frames line up can directly influence when packets are sent to the server and when game-state packets from the server are read.\n\n \n\n**2.2 Usercommand flow stability through multi-execution**\n\nUsercommand flow is affected by both jitter and loss. In the following graphic I am assuming around half a tick (\\~7.8ms at 64 tick) of jitter.\n\n[Fig. 2.2](https://preview.redd.it/gpk9v53fwxxf1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2613812fb5204cecb4597e0e9d26857cd7d49043)\n\nIn this example, game-state packets would never arrive late, as all consecutive packets would fall in consecutive intervals between ticks. The story is different for usercommand packets. As we can see, roughly a third of packets in this scenario (assuming a uniform distribution) would arrive late. Mind you, there is no mechanism to synchronize when the client creates and sends commands, which means that command packets missing their arrival window is commonplace in CSGO.\n\nIf we assume the server neither buffers commands to be processed on the next tick and only executes one command per tick (per player), the commands would be essentially lost. But that is not the case: The server allocates an additional command of budget to each player each tick.\\* This budget is not necessarily consumed on that tick. If it happened, for example, that a command arrived late, i.e. after the highlighted server tick in the graphic, the budget for that player on the next tick would be two commands. Assuming the next command did not arrive late, the server would then run through both commands in one tick.\n\nAs you can imagine, this has some potential for abuse. The maximum number of commands to be executed on one tick is set by sv\\_maxusrcmdprocessticks and its default value is a staggering 16 commands.\\*\\* This means you could teleport the equivalent of 125ms of motion on a 128 tick server. In the following example, I used clumsy (a tool to create bad network conditions and/or fakelag) to bunch up commands by increasing latency to one instance of CS:GO, while another instance is spectating.\n\n[Vid 2.1](https://reddit.com/link/1oiq4a7/video/l9vaja4vwxxf1/player)\n\nBut this model does not just pose questions of intentional abuse. How does the client handle the positions of enemy players whose position did not update in one tick and then updates the equivalent of two ticks of motion? Again, given there is no synchronisation mechanism, this is commonplace even with players with good internet. This will be cleared up in 2.3.\n\nAnd what about packet-loss? CS:GO mitigates packet-loss by packaging the last couple of commands together. So, instead of just sending the latest usercommand, the server gets two more commands\\*\\*\\*: the two commands preceding the latest one. This way, up to two lost command packets in a row can be completely compensated for. A usercommand coming late or said usercommand being lost makes very little difference thanks to this redundancy.\n\n \n\n\\**player\\_command.cpp, l. 322 onwards*\n\n\\*\\*[This old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dw4t4/sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks_research_and_explanation/) *by a Valve employee suggests that this value was probably 8 on official Valve servers, to match a value of 16 on 128 tick*\n\n\\*\\*\\**cl\\_cmdbackup in cl\\_main.cpp, l. 2707*\n\n \n\n**2.3 The role of additional interpolation delay**\n\nNow I flipped the jitter situation around. The server is unaffected by jitter in our client’s commands but the incoming game-state information might miss the target client tick.\n\n[Fig 2.3](https://preview.redd.it/022kjt7g8yxf1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac578d41449be66d59eab17f1281afc7eafc55e0)\n\nIf a game-state packet misses the expected arrival window, that client tick will run and all frames up to the next client tick won’t have new information to interpolate towards, if using the minimum interpolation delay of one tick-interval. To protect against this, CS:GO simply uses an additional tick of interpolation delay. It uses an interpolation delay of 1 tick + the value of cl\\_interp\\_ratio.\\* That means the minimum delay you can have is two ticks and not one.\\*\\* This works well enough, because while this would still mean that all game-state information might arrive late (or possibly early), the one area where it is most noticeable, which is enemy player movement, is curbed. I doubt that you would worry about that one AK shot being a tick off in the heat of the moment.\n\nThis is also how packet-loss and usercommand loss/jitter is smoothed over. A missing packet is not a big deal for player motion when you have the one afterwards available already, as you can just as well interpolate between non-consecutive ticks, i.e. the latest and third latest position in this case instead of the second- and third latest. This also curbs possible visual output issues of delayed usercommand execution. If the server has no usercommand for an enemy player on a tick but two on the next, that tick without a new usercommand is simply ignored, with all connected clients interpolating between the one before and after for the specific player who this happened to. Mind you that this only works in this specific situation. If the server missed more than one of your opponents command packets, they can still stutter or teleport on your screen.\n\nPrediction is not affected by the additional interpolation delay and follows a strict one tick interpolation delay, equivalent to cl\\_interp\\_ratio 0. This makes sense, because the data would never arrive late, as it is generated locally with every client tick.\n\nI did not mention clock-drift when I was talking about usercommand management, because there is no management for it on the command side at all. But there is on the client-receive side. Each client tick, the client notes the offset between the ever-incrementing client tick count and the server tick count of the incoming packet. It then averages this offset over the last 16 ticks to determine offset.\\*\\*\\* Since we can assume some baseline micro-jitter from both networking and the client tick running on-frame, if the theoretical tick-time is on the boundary, you will basically always have a mix of values in the history (bouncing between an offset of 0 and 1 for example). The threshold at which clockdrift starts being corrected for is 10ms (set by cl\\_clock\\_correction\\_adjustment\\_min\\_offset).\n\nThe extra tick of interpolation delay also plays a crucial role for clockdrift protection. It does not just allow for some protection against jitter and loss, but also prevents running out of world position information to interpolate towards in case we outrun the server. Do note that despite the tickrate technically changing, the simulation tick interval does not change at all, meaning a 64 tick experience would always be simulated as 64 tick. It is akin to using a very minor deviance from 1.0 with host\\_timescale.\n\nFor usercommands, there only exists such protection if the client is the slower party. This would cause the command budget to increment on the server without consuming another usercommand. This is going to be visible for other players as a minor warp, as the player position update just does not just not happen for a tick, the next tick also does not have two commands to run to compensate (see also Fig 1.2). Another minor warp would then happen when clock correction kicks in and speeds up, essentially reclaiming that extra command budget.\n\n\\**See c\\_baseentity.cpp, l. 6419 onwards*\n\n\\*\\**That also means* [*Fletcher Dunn was wrong*](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2/comments/1akszme/comment/kpo41y5/)*, as the function GetInterpolationAmount() referenced above also accounts for render interpolation.*\n\n\\*\\*\\**See servermsghandler.cpp l.297, CClockDriftMgr::GetCurrentClockDifference() in clockdriftmgr.cpp and host.cpp l. 2443. The aggressivity is mainly dictated by cl\\_clock\\_correction\\_adjustment\\_min\\_offset and cl\\_clock\\_correction\\_adjustment\\_max\\_amount.*\n\n \n\n# 3. CS2\n\n**3.1 Data transfer in CS2**\n\nCS2 goes about data transmission and stability quite differently.\n\n[Fig 3.1 - The values are arbitrary](https://preview.redd.it/vvo51iuaxxxf1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e916993d811c68cfb315cbfbc475373f51f3880e)\n\nIn CS:GO, client-ticks handled prediction, command sending, data reception and represented the theoretical time for interpolation(remember: client-ticks were processed on frames. The client-tick would run on the next frame after the client ticks theoretical time, so we care about that theoretical time to get the correct interpolation fraction).\n\nThis combined client tick is no more. Client-movement-simulation and world-state-ticks on the client were split off from each other. In simplified terms on this graphic: the red “client-output and send tick” handles usercommand generation, sending and prediction, the blue “client-world-state and receive tick” handles incoming game-state packets and represents their theoretical time for interpolation.\\* These ticks run asynchronously to each other, but their processing still falls on frames in the main thread. At least this is true for game-state processing and prediction. Usercommands are sent to the server asynchronously, which will become important later.\n\n*\\*If you look at the cs\\_usercmd.proto (SteamDatabase/Protobufs repo), these seem to correspond to rendertick and playertick in the input history entries.*\n\n \n\n**3.2 Receive-margin management**\n\n**Receive-margins** in CS2 are measured differently to the tick-offset that dictated clock-correction in CS:GO. Instead of an integer-tick-offset, the time of packet arrival is measured and the delta to the consumption time is used. This measurement is done on both the client and the server, with the server giving the client feedback on its previous receive margins, which can then be used to adjust its command generation rate. This is part of why asynchronous usercommand sending is important. It reduces jitter from frame timing variance (not to be confused with frame-time variance, here we care about when a frame happens and not how long it took) and latency.\n\nThis management makes the extra tick of interpolation delay obsolete for clock-correction. If the client was drifting slowly and ran faster than the server, it would notice the shrinking receive margin before it ever got starved of new game-state packets and would be able to slow itself down to get back to the correct target margin. Likewise, if the server received usercommands later or earlier, that would mean that the client is most likely generating them too slowly or quickly and since the client is getting feedback on its server receive-margin, it can speed up or slow down before the server ever gets starved.\n\nThe default receive-margin target (both for client- and server-receive-margin) is 5ms. The relevant usercommands around client- and server-receive-margin-management are prefixed with **cl\\_clock\\_** for client-reception and **cl\\_tickpacket\\_** for server-reception.\n\n \n\n**3.3 Buffering, usercommand-redundancy and…..multi-execution?**\n\nArriving usercommands enter a **command-queue** unless they get consumed directly on the next server tick. The server will not execute more than one **full** usercommand per tick, unlike CS:GO, where that feature was pretty crucial to compensate for jitter and loss, but with the already noted downsides. CS2 handles things a bit differently, though…not entirely differently as we will see.\n\nThe length of the command-queue is directly linked to the server receive-margin. A receive-margin of between 1 and 2 tick-intervals translates to a command-queue length of one and likewise, any additional tick-interval of receive-margin adds another command of length to the command-queue. This makes sense because it means that before a command has been consumed, the one proceeding it has already arrived.\n\nIf you have loss (or jitter) on the sending-side, the game will speed up the “client-output speed”, i.e. run prediction faster and send commands more often to target a longer receive-margin. This speeding up can be directly demonstrated by binding cl\\_tickpacket\\_desired\\_queuelength to a key to toggle between 0 and 5. The sum of this value (in ticks, then converted to milliseconds) and the base target margin of 5ms represents the final margin target. The following clips are recorded without loopback locally (accessible through the console by launching a map with “loopback=0” at the end, i.e. “map mapname loopback=0”, with loopback prediction and server simulation would run at the same time in sync). I set cl\\_showtick to 8, which puts a number on how far ahead the client prediction is running vs the game-state ticks, to make it even easier to see.\n\n[Vid 3.1 - Increasing our margin target by 5 ticks, you can see that we are out-speeding the the bot until the speed-up ends](https://reddit.com/link/1oiq4a7/video/4v8j2eggyxxf1/player)\n\n[Vid 3.2 - Decreasing our margin target by 5 ticks, you can see that the bot is catching up to us until the slow-down ends](https://reddit.com/link/1oiq4a7/video/ylnyl1eryxxf1/player)\n\nMuch like how the CS:GO client sent the last 3 usercommands, **the CS2 client sends the last four commands together instead of just the latest one**. Together with a lengthened receive-margin and the resulting command-queue, this ensures that lost packets can be completely compensated for without any impairment. With a receive-margin of &gt;3 ticks, this works for up to 3 lost packets in a row, in which case the 4th packet provides all otherwise lost usercommands.\n\nBut what if we just have spontaneous packet-loss? At first, the server will just duplicate the last known command and execute it. This way, a lagging player won’t stutter on other people\'s screens. To make sure that the client isn’t corrected forward because prediction is essentially a command behind (the server ran all of the clients incoming commands + a duplicate one), the server cannot not run the later available commands as usual. Instead, to ensure the information from those packets is not lost, it executes commands that are available too late to be on-time with a timestep size of zero. The maximum number of which to run before the normal on-time command is controlled by **sv\\_late\\_commands\\_allowed**. This ensures that critical actions, like shooting and movement inputs, especially jumping\\*, don’t get lost. Interestingly, even if you were to set that variable to zero you would not lose inputs, but you would lose the correct timing information for shots for example. This is because the game still condenses inputs that have not had a chance to be recognized as part of a usercommand, enabled by **sv\\_condense\\_late\\_buttons**, but seemingly without correct lag compensation information in the case of shots.\\*\\* This is just a sidenote though, given that sv\\_late\\_commands\\_allowed is set to 5.\n\nNote that not all margin adjustments are in full ticks. Micro-jitter is generally compensated in the same way, by slightly increasing the receive margin.\n\nAnother sidenote: Prediction in CS2 is running one tick ahead compared to CS:GO to enable next-frame response. The player head position is still an interpolation between two ticks, with the second one being updated on button press. Only once the position of that prediction-tick is reached is the usercommand sent. This means that while we saved a tick of end-to-end latency between players by removing the extra tick of interpolation delay, we are giving it right back for lower input latency. For peeker\'s advantage, the difference with both changes is essentially zero from CS:GO. Do note that I am only referring to theoretical peeker\'s advantage, as other factors do play into the advantage a peeker might have, like animations.\n\n\\**Jumping because it is often done via the scroll wheel. A jump input via spacebar would usually span multiple ticks and so the next command would have that information anyway.*\n\n\\*\\**Much like with jumping, shots would still go through even with both disabled unless I bound shooting to the mouse wheel, in which case the shot did not get fired on the server-side anymore when the command was lost, as it was just culled, even though it was available later, again so prediction doesn’t go out of line.*\n\n \n\n**3.4 Client sided buffering**\n\nThis portion is reminiscent of CS:GOs handling with some differences. As mentioned before, since the client receive-margin is properly managed, there is no need for that one additional tick of interpolation delay to mitigate unavoidable clock-drift or micro-jitter. But we obviously still need some sort of margin so we can adjust for clock-drift before it becomes a problem and to account for said micro-jitter. We also want to be able to account for packet-loss.\n\nSimilarly to the server receive-margin, the client receive-margin can be adjusted. With a receive-margin of over one tick, single packets lost can once again be smoothed over perfectly by interpolating between the tick before and after with no noticable visual impairment. This time by changing the “client-world-state tick” speed;  slowing down, and thereby increasing the receive-margin, or speeding up, and thereby decreasing the receive-margin. Note that here, slowing down and speeding up has the opposite effect that it has with the server receive-margin. As touched on in 1.1, this is because the change to the receive-margin depends on the rate difference between the sender and the receiver. This is very visible in Fig 1.2, where the sender ticks come closer and closer to the receiver ticks, until there is no sender tick for a receiver tick interval. The sender running faster than the receiver means a growing receive-margin and the sender running slower than the receiver means a shrinking receive-margin and eventual packet starvation. Increasing the sending rate has the same effect as decreasing the receiving rate and since here the receiving rate is adjusted, it is opposite to the server receive-margin management.\n\nThe behavior of the client receive-margin management has been adjusted multiple times over the lifetime of CS2. There was a period towards the end of last year where it was very aggressive and a few packets lost would already prompt a receive-margin increase of 1 to 2 ticks. Now it is much more tame again and the visual stutter from some lost packets is simply accepted. This means possibly accepting marginal hitches in the movement of other playermodels but also a consistently lower latency.\n\n \n\n**3.5 Hidden latency**\n\nCS2’s system will trade stability for latency in case network instability is detected. The receive-margins directly sum into total latency. This latency, however, is completely opaque to the player, unless they know what they are looking for and is what prompted the wave of “dying behind walls” and “warping” posts (which stems from misprediction when shot, i.e. you were hit on the server and your client is correcting its prediction smoothly) towards the middle of last year. If you go back to posts with r\\_show\\_build\\_info true from that time, you will often see inflated values, particularly the first one. Note again that in CS:GO there were such margins too, but they were not measured at all.\n\nThe information provided so far can be mapped pretty easily to the big block of 5 numbers in the build info with the following pattern **XX-YY-ZZ-AA-BB**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7gwlc8tzxxf1.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed04a3497dde13f29031416b8ca3031f3df92f11\n\n**X**: This is the server receive-margin in milliseconds  \n**Y**: This is the round-trip latency, i.e. the ping  \n**Z**: This is the client receive-margin in milliseconds  \n**A**: This is loss from the server to the client (i.e. game-state packets) in % times ten, over 9.9% shows as 99  \n**B**: This is loss from the client to the server (i.e. sets of usercommands) in % times ten, over 9.9% shows as 99\n\nThe build info misses the server processing time, but that is generally pretty negligible. So in this example, our total latency from sending our usercommand to getting feedback on our actions from that usercommand will sum up to \\~7ms + \\~10ms + \\~7ms = \\~24ms\n\nAnother noteworthy command to use is **cl\\_ticktiming print** (alternatively, you can use an integer N in place of print to get a short summary every Nth tick). This gives an overview of all the sources of latency. Of note: the sum is a worst case, as First Input -&gt; NetSend can be up to a full tick interval long. On average this value comes out to half a tick interval.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, even knowing your own hidden latency, the hidden latency of enemy players stays opaque, so you might die a bit further behind a wall than usual, even though your latency and the enemies ping might seem low.\n\n\n\n \n\n# 4. Summary\n\nCS2’s networking architecture is a total revamp and not an evolution of Source-1’s design. Because it avoids full multi-execution of commands like CS:GO had done, it prevents players with bad connections or intentional lag-switching from having an advantage from being harder to hit or teleporting into people’s faces. With its dynamic receive margin management, stability can be achieved under conditions that would make CS:GO fold. This stability, however, is paid in latency **when, and only when**, an increase in receive-margins is involved. This latency being mostly opaque to players has led to confusion, as players do sometimes notice a disconnect between the ping on the scoreboard and their experience in the game.\n\nI hope this post provided a good overview of the fundamental networking differences between CS:GO and CS2! If there are any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments, though I don’t know how fast I can answer them as I need a break.\n\n Addendum: A lot of people seem to think that CS2 just generally trades for more stability with higher latency. This is not the case and not what I am talking about when I am talking about trading stability for (low) latency. Source 2\'s system allows that trade to be made when it is necessary, as well as allowing for lower and more consistent latency when it is not. It being able to do this dynamically is the core strength of this system.\n\n# 5: Appendix\n\nOn this site you can look up the description for all of the commands I mentioned, as most of them are hidden in-game, unless you use a convar unlocker: [cs2.poggu.me/dumped-data/convar-list/](http://cs2.poggu.me/dumped-data/convar-list/)  \nOf note are the following sets of commands:  \ncl\\_clock\\*  \ncl\\_tickpacket\\*  \ncq\\*  \nsv\\_condense\\_late\\_buttons  \nsv\\_late\\_commands\\_allowed\n\nThe asterisks indicate that there is a whole lot of commands starting with whatever I wrote before them, e.g. cl\\_clock\\*\\_buffer\\_ticks\\*.\n\nAnother post recently mentioned sv\\_clockcorrection\\_msecs. I unfortunately did not have the time to investigate the exact purpose of said convar, only having a brief look at its use in the leaked CS:GO source code, of which I could not make much sense in the short time I had a look. I do know for certain, however, that it has nothing to do with what was described as clock correction in this post. I would also not be surprised if that convar has long outlived its purpose.', 'Hyperus102', 'GlobalOffensive', 'https://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1oiq4a7/networking_architecture_cs2_vs_csgo/', 2619, 257, '2025-10-29 06:16:08', '2025-11-07 23:43:30');

The president [claimed](https://archive.ph/NwD5Q) that the boats were carrying “Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists…transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States.” However, a [War Powers Resolution report](https://www.justsecurity.org/120296/many-ways-caribbean-strike-unlawful/) submitted to Congress offered no evidence to support that assertion—making no mention of the alleged gang affiliation of the victims or any intent to reach U.S. shores.\n\nEven if some of those killed were suspected of gang involvement, nothing in U.S. law allows the premeditated government assassination of people suspected of drug trafficking. Standard protocol calls for the U.S. Coast Guard to intercept such vessels, conduct investigations, and, if illegal narcotics are found, make arrests. Yet Secretary of State Marco Rubio [admitted](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rubio-trump-blow-up-drug-boat-venezuela_n_68b8bfbfe4b06793d89d3293) that in at least some cases, interception was feasible. “Instead of interdicting it,” he said, “on the president’s orders, we blew it up — and it’ll happen again.”\n\n**Sept. 1:** First known strike on a civilian boat, killing all eleven onboard. Later reports revealed that it was likely going to Trinidad and Tobago (approximately seven miles away), not the United States. Furthermore, upon noticing the military aircraft, the people onboard [turned around](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/trump-drug-boat-venezuela-strike.html) and began to head back to Venezuela before the strikes. According to a report by [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2025/09/10/u-s-attacked-boat-near-venezuela-multiple-times-to-kill-survivors/), the military launched several strikes against the boat to kill all survivors.\n\n**Sept. 5:** The Trump administration [sent](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-sends-10-fighter-jets-to-puerto-rico-for-strikes-against-drug-cartels/) ten stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico, in addition to three Aegis guided-missile destroyers deployed to the region in August, for operations targeting drug cartels.\n\n**Sept. 15:** Trump [announced](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-strike-second-alleged-venezuela-drug-boat/) a second strike on a civilian boat allegedly transporting drugs somewhere in the Caribbean. Three people were killed.\n\n&gt;\"BE WARNED — IF YOU ARE TRANSPORTING DRUGS THAT CAN KILL AMERICANS, WE ARE HUNTING YOU!\" Mr. Trump wrote.\n\n**Sept. 15:** Trump [said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lyvqlwdcyv23) “there are no ships in the ocean anymore,” adding “To be honest, if I were a fisherman, I wouldn’t want to go fishing either. ‘Maybe they think I have drugs downstairs’.” \n\n**Sept. 18:** The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-lawyers-raise-concerns-over-trumps-drug-boat-strikes-b8327a5c?mod=hp_lista_pos3) that some military lawyers and Defense Department officials have raised concerns that the strikes may not be legal, but they “believe they are being ignored or deliberately sidelined.”\n\n**Sept. 19:** Trump [announced](https://archive.ph/faTmO) a third strike on a civilian boat allegedly transporting drugs, killing three. The Dominican Republic later [revealed](https://apnews.com/article/cocaine-speedboat-trump-dominican-republic-e42c255ec0e8d5c2d85a7670d12adfdf) that it had cooperated with the U.S. military to locate the vessel and claimed to recover 377 packages of cocaine among the wreckage.\n\n**Sept. 22:** Trump [said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzgjcg5ghs2t), “There are no boats in the water anymore. You don\'t even find a fishing boat, you don\'t even find cruise liners anymore. There\'s nothing in the water near Venezuela. It\'s actually strange. You know what that means? That means there are no drugs coming in.”\n\n**Sept. 28:** The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/world/americas/venezuela-mood.html?unlocked_article_code=1.pU8.APvU.1xV5LiqogIhr&amp;smid=url-share) that, according to a Venezuelan woman whose husband was killed in one of the strikes, he was just “a fisherman with four children who left one day for work and never came back.”\n\n**Sept. 29:** The Guardian [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/stephen-miller-venezuela-drug-boat-strike) that Stephen Miller “played a leading role in directing” the strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, “at times [...] supersed[ing]” Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n**Oct. 2:** Trump [informed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/02/politics/trump-admin-us-armed-conflict-cartels) Congress that he determined that the U.S. is engaged in formal “armed conflict” with drug cartels, labeling people who are suspected of smuggling drugs as “enemy combatants” in an attempt to provide legal justification for the boat strikes. \n\n**Oct. 3:** Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-conducts-fourth-strike-boat-claims-was-trafficking-drugs-venezuela-rcna235517) that a fourth strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela killed all four onboard.\n\n**Oct. 3:** Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, [released](https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-statement-on-trump-declaring-armed-conflict-in-the-caribbean) the following statement: “Every American should be alarmed that the President believes he can wage secret wars against anyone he chooses.

(184, 'reddit', '1oph0im', 'Rude client wasted almost 1 hour to hear same info I told her already from different employee', 'My first post here, not sure if it better fits here or at r/pettyrevenge but anyways.\n\nSome years ago I worked at bank office (not in the US). I was mediocre at sales, but good at service and processes, conditions, pricings etc, so I was put at administrator position (not a manager one). My job was to meet incoming clients and help them to solve their problem by helping them with the ATM or mobile app, or by navigating them to the right specialist via electronic queue, etc.\n\nSo there was this woman, let\'s call her CUSTOMER, she came to the office and asked for money withdrawal. I recommended her to use ATM and she told me she already used it, but can withdraw more due to daily limit.\n\nI asked how much she want to withdraw (it was 600 000 of our local currency) and replied that due to bank policy to withdraw that amount of money via cashier she need to order it in 5 days (for safety reasons) and only amount we can give her today is 150 000 without fee and 300 000 more with 2,5% fee, but she can use ATM tomorrow and withdraw all needed amount with no fees, because daily limit will refresh.\n\nShe wasn\'t happy, and I can understand this, but then she started being rude and unreasonable.\n\nCUSTOMER: I need to talk with more experienced employee, what do you mean I can\'t withdraw my money, it\'s a bank.\n\nMe: they will tell you the same, it\'s a bank policy, fastest and cheapest way for you to withdraw needed amount is to use ATM next day, technically after midnight, if it\'s somehow urgent.\n\nCUSTOMER: No. I don\'t want to talk with you, you are some newbie, just give me queue number and I\'ll talk with proper bank worker.\n\nNow worth noting that I was most experienced employee in the office in terms of operational work, including manager, so I giggled inside, but that was her clear will, so I gave her number and moved on.\n\nTwenty minutes later (yeah, it was busy evening) her number was called to desk and she started asking same questions from a new girl (worked around 1 month at this point). Let\'s name this girl Eve. She wasn\'t familiar enough with everything, so she started casual identification procedure, by checking client ID in the UV, searching for client profile in database, sending her SMS-code to approve entering profile etc, so around 5 minutes more were gone.\n\nThen Eve asked what operation lady want to do and lady repeated her question. Eve tried to start withdrawal and noticed she can\'t make more than 450 000 and there is fee. And what do you think? She called me to help. I walked around the desk and asked Eve what happened.\n\nEve: Look, CUSTOMER want to withdraw 600 000 and I can\'t type more than 450 000 and there is fee.\n\nMe: I\'m sorry, I can\'t help here, client insisted to have more experienced employee to answer his questions. And left back to my work place.\n\nAfter that there was some banter between CUSTOMER and poor Eve, trying to explain same stuff while I typed everything to her in work chat. Then she gave up and offered CUSTOMER to talk with manager, if she\'s unhappy. She waited 20 more minutes for manager and heard same info I told her 50 minutes ago and Eve repeated 20 minutes ago: today she can have 150k for free and 300k more with fees, after midnight she can have 600k with no fees via ATM, and in case of big withdrawals in future she need to order cash in advance.\n\nCUSTOMER left furiously not looking at me.\n\nTLDR: bank customer wasn\'t happy with my consultation, telling me I\'m nobody, and then lost 50 minutes to hear the same answer twice', 'iwantshortnick', 'MaliciousCompliance', 'https://reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1oph0im/rude_client_wasted_almost_1_hour_to_hear_same/', 2569, 199, '2025-11-06 05:13:24', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),
(185, 'reddit', '1oa9kh8', 'Ex best friend is miserable after becoming a mom and is threatened by me', '**TL;DR:** Ex–best friend used milestones (marriage, baby, etc.) to feel superior. Now I’m thriving child-free, and she’s miserable in the life she bragged about.\n\n**Backstory:**  \nBack in my 20s my ex best friend “Claire” started dating one of my close guy friends. The moment they got together, he cut me off completely and she ghosted me while I was going through a breakup and moving out on my own for the first time. She started acting really weird the moment I became single. When she finally resurfaced, it was just to announce her engagement. I told her I was happy for her but also said it hurt that she disappeared—apparently that was enough to end the friendship.\n\nA year later I apologized and took accountability for saying I was happy for her which I genuinely was, AND also lumping my hurt feelings of her ghosting me in the same conversation. I did that cause I didn\'t know if she was gonna ghost again. She took that as me NOT being happy for her. She said forgave me and we tried being friends again. I went to her wedding shower, her wedding and tried being a supportive friend. To be clear, since we reconciled I’ve done *nothing* to her. No gossip, no attitude, no drama.\n\nThen I went on *one date* with an old coworker we both knew. I wasn’t even serious about him—saw red flags and moved on. But she *hated* this guy (which I did not know) and completely lost it when she found out. She sent me screenshots of him flirting with other women, like she was trying to make me upset even though I literally didn’t care. Later she and her fiancé cornered me at a bar and yelled that I was “boy-crazy” and “desperate.” I’d been on *one* date. She also refused to apologize for her behaviour at the bar the next day. I checked out of the friendship at that point and distanced myself, but we still have a lot of mutuals so I didn\'t block her on anything.\n\nAfter that she’d still pop up on my IG stories, asking if every guy in frame was my boyfriend, and later making comments about my actual partner (“isn’t he a bit old for you?”). Then after two years of silence she invited me to her baby shower. I declined. Why was I going to buy this person a present with my own money who was an asshole to me AND only pops up when she hits a milestone? (I was right to call her out on this in the very beginning then). Heard later only two friends went, and they got the impression she and her husband practically ghosted everyone and was reaching out at the scraps of friendships they had left.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Sometime after she messaged me about the baby shower, I got rid of instagram and facebook and have not been on either in about a year. I left for my own mental health reasons and it took too much of my time. Not really because of her. So now the only way she has access to me is in person group events if she even goes. \n\n**Fast-forward to last night:**\n\nI see her at a get-together, which I was surprised she showed up to. She ignores me, complains nonstop about motherhood, pregnancy, work, her body—everything to the person next to me right as I sat down. I would ask questions and she\'d ignore me. Trying to not make any eye contact with me and sometimes physically trying to sit as far away from me as possible. Her husband won’t make eye contact, wont hold a conversation for longer than a clipped sentence or be silent. I also noticed her husband didn\'t talk to any of the other women at the table and its not the first time I have seen this.\n\nI acted totally normal.  I’m laughing with friends, happily child-free, new homeowner, solid relationship, great job. I also looked good yesterday. I am in the best shape of my life. When someone congratulated me on buying a place, she cut in with, “Ugh, I hate that area, it’s so busy.”\n\nSo I smiled and asked, “So would you recommend being a mom? Would you do it all again?”  \nShe said, “No.” And continued to be the negative at the table bitching about how hard it is to be a mom to anyone who would listen.\n\nGuess milestones aren’t much fun when you’re the only one keeping score.', 'Dry-Trust-3465', 'childfree', 'https://reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1oa9kh8/ex_best_friend_is_miserable_after_becoming_a_mom/', 2565, 126, '2025-10-19 04:37:38', '2025-11-07 23:43:30');

I grew up living with two younger brothers, one younger sister, grandparents, and my mom and dad. I\'m significantly the oldest kid in my family; 8 years older than John (my brother, the second oldest in the house).\n\nMy parents never assigned chores to any of us growing up but I helped out around the house a lot. I\'ve just always been very cleanly and organized, and I never minded it. I was always cleaning, vacuuming, doing dishes, helping cook, doing the family\'s laundry, etc. Nobody forced this role on me, but nobody really appreciated it or thanked me either. Again, I didn\'t really mind. I was just being a dutiful daughter/responsible person.\n\nI lived at home through college (I grew up in my college town so I just commuted). A few months ago, however, I had decided that I had saved enough money and got an apartment with some of my college friends.\n\nApparently, since I have moved out, our family situation has become chaotic and my mom feels overwhelmed. No one helps her at all with any chores. She basically told me that she had no idea how much I was helping out around the house until I moved out. \n\nBecause I was always doing stuff without being asked, she didn\'t really know who was keeping everything clean and just assumed it was a joint effort from the whole family. Now that nobody is around to silently look after everyone, everything is a mess. Everyone in my home has developed a string of messy bad habits because somebody else was taking care of them all the time.\n\nShe said it\'s my responsibility that no one in the family has learned to properly take care of themselves growing up, and wants me to move back home. I don\'t know if I should do it. I guess growing up, especially with my younger siblings, I was just always the default babysitter. \n\nI was just used to taking care of them, so even when they got to the age where they were old enough to take care of themselves, I was too far in the habit. I don\'t know how me moving back home will totally fix that, though, but I do feel a little responsible.\n\ntl;dr: Grew up taking care of my family and household duties.

I moved out and my home has become a mess. No one realized how much I cleaned up around the house until I was gone, and now my mom wants me to move back.\n\nI was kind of surprised by how much everyones response to my mother was a resounding no. It made me feel silly for even considering it; there was really no benefit to keep enabling my mom and move back home.\n\nWell, Reddit, I\'m sad to say that turning my mom down was the first time I had ever really stood up to her, and it did not go well. She instantly starting gulit tripping me -- how she had raised me, how family was everything, how I was being selfish and abandoning her\n\nWhen that didn\'t work, her insults turned more aggressive. She said I owed her money -- the money it cost to raise me, put me through college (my parents paid partial tuition), the accumulation of \"rent\" for letting me live at home during college (at no point had we ever discussed this), etc. Again, she pressed that I was taking advantage of the family by not moving back home and helping out.\n\nI don\'t wanna get into much detail because I am still very, very sad about how this has turned out, but my mom hasn\'t responded to my calls in weeks. She\'s antagonized me against the whole family, telling my siblings that I did something ambiguously terrible and am abandoning the family. I had a phone conversation with my sister Rachel, who said something along the lines of \"mom said you did something really mean to her, she won\'t tell us what, but she said that\'s why she made you move out.\" I\'ve never been really close to my siblings, but I\'m kind of taken aback how little anyone seems to care that I\'m gone.\n\nRecently my mom put up a picture on Facebook of the whole family, with me absent, captioned \"The only people in my life I\'ll ever need.\"\n\nI\'m trying to focus on my work and my friends to get through this, but I am in a very sad place right now.\n\ntl;dr Mom didn\'t take it well that I\'m not moving home.

All you\'re doing is making her feel better by allowing her to give you the silent treatment. Stop doing that, and go about living your life. Hell, unfollow her on Facebook so you don\'t have to see any of the shit she posts. If any of your siblings call again, ask if they notice how filthy the house has gotten since you left. Tell them you were the one keeping the house clean, and mom\'s pissed because you refused to come back home and play servant. If they get pissy too, block their numbers and carry on with your life. Things will cool down in a few months, and you can reestablish a relationship with your family on your terms.\n&gt;\n&gt;**u/booksOnTheShelf**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*First of all, quit calling mom.

(187, 'reddit', '1omser2', 'I ended up replaying the entirety of Pokémon Y to make a list of all the continuities I could find!', 'TLDR: Notes on continuities between the two games, and QoL changes for curious new players. Includes relevant story spoilers for XY, some for Z-A, which will be spoiler marked.\n\nI’ve ended up enjoying Z-A even more after re-experiencing Y and wanted to share my findings! It’s kinda surreal seeing how the two games feel side by side with a 12 year gap between release. It’s also a direct sequel for all intents and purposes, which makes it all the more fascinating.\n\n**CONTINUITY**\n\nHere are points of continuity between the games. Some points are less serious than others, but are all still worthy of note. Some personal liberties have also been applied here regarding implications.\n\n1. Mable’s character dialogue was COMPLETELY different between the games. While she has a strong informal accent in Z-A, she instead spoke in a fairly stiff and formal tone in XY. She was also one of four similarly fashioned scientists who showed little personality. Now she has a gamer chair.  \n(+) She also asks the same question in both games, asking if you were alone or not. Answering yes results in the same response along the lines of \"So your Pokemon don\'t count? That\'s cold.\" (Credit: DragoSphere)  \n2. Many of the paintings in Z-A’s museum are actually the exact same as the ones in XY, just higher resolution. XY had a few more paintings though, particularly of other regions. A notable one that’s missing in Z-A is the mural depicting the “King” and Floette.  \n3. Emma still fondly remembers Looker and Xerosic based on the portraits found on the side of room in Z-A. She’s also gotten fully used to Lumiose life compared to her original isolated self.\n4. Hotel Richissime is apparently known to not have locked hotel room doors in XY. In-game they didn’t even have doors.\n5. Trevor (one of the XY protag rivals) had a house in Lumiose City. It’s since been completely doinked apparently.  \n6. There used to be a “Lumiose Gang” before the Rust Syndicate. Many of those gang members had British accents (Galar? I don’t think SWSH was even planned back in 2013, likely just a characterisation quirk). Phillipe *feels* like someone who would’ve stemmed from these roots, before being overtaken by Corbeau, but this is simply conjecture.  \n7. EV drinks used to cost 9,800. But have since been reduced to 5000. Bless whoever governs Kalos rn.  \n8. Luxury balls used to cost 1000. But have since been raised to 3000. Curse whoever governs Kalos rn.  \n9. Holographic tech actually existed in the original XY, even being used for the standard route signs. The tech in Z-A is certainly a step up though. Kalos as a whole seems to be more advanced than most of the regions we’ve seen so far.  \n10. The furfrou market seems to have declined. They used to have a whole boutique by Cafe Woof, but it’s now just one lady against the world.  \n11. Kalos has always had some freaky folks in it (pics in the comments).  \n12. Store clerks have been phased out, supposedly consumed by the army of Nurse Joys.  \n13. The stone emporium has a wider selection of products in Z-A, implying their rock stonks have upped big time.  \n14. Cafe Nouveau’s &gt;!logo is literally just the Team Flare logo rotated a bit with a modernised “N” squiggle on top. I embarrassingly didn’t notice this until I finished Z-A.!&lt;  \n15. L &gt;!Has since had a haircut and greyed. Showing off the customisations Lumiose has to offer, but also as a symbolic nod to his fire burning out.!&lt;  \n16. The area in which Zygarde is found in XY features tunnels that form a shape of a “Y” imposed over an “X”. &gt;!This same shape is found in its mega, at the tip of the cannon.!&lt;  \n17. The only notable gravesite in Kalos was Route 10, so having one at the heart of Kalos (Wild Zone 4) now could show a shift in the zeitgeist. One that’s more accepting of death (many NPCs in Z-A mention the themes of life and death). Possibly a reaction to the events of five years ago.  \n(+) &gt;!Lysandre Labs!&lt; still has the room that featured a rock being scanned, which was a fragment of one of the graves from Route 10. (Credit: Sapphireman)  \n18. Much more outdoor seating areas for cafes and on rooftops now. Climate seems to have improved for Lumiose now that they don’t have to worry about bad weather like the Galarians.  \n19. XY actually featured some battles in the city alleyways. While these were far less remarkable, these instances could’ve inspired the Battle Royale format we see today.  \n20. Even though Z-A features anti-homeless architecture via the benches. XY didn’t even have benches… so I’d say they’re making some progress, albeit slowly.  \n21. Being able to catch Yveltal/Xerneas/Zygarde in Z-A implies the XY protag released them at somepoint.  \n22. NPC dialogue in XY remarked that Prism Tower is like a lighthouse for people’s mind. A lot of symbolism is at play in Z-A with this in mind, as uncertainty and doubt plagues the city.  \n23. Grisham and Griselle both have Gris in their name, which is the French word for Grey. Make of that what you will!\n24. Lida is strongly implied to be Tierno’s (one of the XY protag’s rivals) sister. \n25. (+) The hex maniacs in these modern times seem a lot more tame than the original 5 years back, with one of the Battle NPCs still trying to find out what \"No, you\'re not the one\" meant. (Credit: homuhomutime)  \n26. (+) Pokepuffs are all but extinct in Z-A. Originally a XY Pokemon-Amie staple, this is because I unfortunately ate all of it \'cos they looked too yummy.  \n27. (+) Rollerskates are no more. (Credit: alliusis, xyinparadise) They miiight have been abolished since people were pulling too many dangerous tricks on the roofs.  \n28. (+) The mega bracelet used to be black, but has since been made gold. This represents the rise of the bourgeoisie in Kalos, unfortunately.  \n29. (+) Hotel Richissime no longer accepts child labour (XY allowed you to take jobs there, mini-game style). (Credit: Emdeoma) I personally head canon this to be a result of Lebanne doing all the labour instead.  \n\n**QOL CHANGES**\n\nThere’s a lot of new players experiencing Kalos for the first time, so I wanted to list all the old limitations XY players had to deal with so you can really enjoy the convenience that Z-A offers:\n\n1. There was NO mints for changing natures.  \n2. There was NO bottle caps for maxing IVs.  \n3. EV raising drinks had a consumable cap of 10 per stat, rest had to be gained via battling specific Pokemon or playing the super training minigame repeatedly.  \n4. All your Pokemon boxes were only accessible in Pokemon centres. Sorting mons and items had to be done separately, and were lower down on a list of options where you could either withdraw or put in Pokémon.  \n5. You couldn’t check the stats of a Pokemon upon capture, would have to travel back to a Pokemon centre.  \n6. Bag inventory lumped mega stones *with* the usual items. They weren’t automatically sorted either (can be done with a toggle).  \n7. Shiny charm was achieved by collecting ALL 700+ mons in the national dex. Over half of which had to be transferred from other games. The regional completion only awarded an Oval charm, which raises egg finding rates in the Daycare.  \n8. Moves had to be deleted by interacting with an NPC. Same for remembering, at the cost of a heart scale, which could only be farmed by using rock smash on rocks.  \n9. HMs were the traditional one move dedicated to a certain obstacle, meaning you’d often have to sacrifice a party slot for a HM slave to do your bidding. Fly/fast travel was one of these.  \n10. Customisation options had a daily rotation of items; not all were available 24/7. No wearable glasses either, only as hat decor.  \n11. No unisex clothing. Female protags had WAY more options than males, even for hair.  \n12. Lumiose City had claustrophobic cameras due to the smaller scale of its art style, it was also split into four enterable sections: north and south boulevard (perimeter), the inner roads leading to the centre, and the centre.  \n13. No convenient mini-map made navigation particularly confusing, especially when compared to the linear nature of every other location in the region.  \n14. The city had a style system that limited access to certain things, requiring interaction with the city to raise your style points.  \n15. Capturing animation was drawn out for the anticipation factor. Z-A is a solid 5x faster, plus you can catch multiple Pokemon at the same time.\n16. Shiny hunting was old school ruthless. No safety nets, you wouldn’t be able to save since you’d only know once in-battle.  \n17. No surprise attacking trainers. Everyone is out to get you.  \n18. Many events happened in certain days of the week to pad out the playtime.  \n19. Some Pokemon could only be found once in an entire playthrough (starters, snorlax, one roaming legendary in a trio per save file).  \n20. Turn based system had many drawn out clunky mechanics (multi-hit moves, multi-stat raising moves, HP depletion etc.)  \n21. (+) Berries had to be farmed in real-time in a limited plot of land. The EV lowering ones particularly were only gained by mutation (chance). You\'d often have to go into various HM-infested areas to find the original tree that has the first berry to find.  \n22. (+) Sky battles were a thing where only flying/levitating Pokemon were allowed to be used. Even then some flying types weren\'t eligible, and many mons were stuck in a perpetual flight animation for generations to come. (Credit: GR7ME)  \n23. (+) Money took longer to acquire since there was no Royale payout, and barely any treasures to pick up.  \n24. (+) Many evolution items were limited per-playthrough. One method of getting some of them requires completing all the super training levels.  \n25. (+) No following Pokemon in the overworld. Though Pokemon-Amie did show the sprite bopping around as you travelled, and humorously flung across the room when you used your skates/bike.  \n26. (+) Finding most of the mega stones was a PAIN, with 80% of them being post-game, scattered across the region, and only findable between 8-9PM. (Credit: AsparagusHuman3236)  \n\nThat’s all the notable ones I jotted down. Feel free to add on to these lists with your own thoughts! Overall I actually prefer the city of Z-A over the entirety of Kalos in XY in terms of execution. Many of the locations in Kalos were fairly flat and linear, without leaving much room for desire or replayability. That’s not to say they’re bad though. Visually it was all pretty!\n\nCheers to anyone who took the time to read all of this :) have a great week!\n\nEDIT: fixed some typos and odd formatting.  \nEDIT 2: added extra points (marked with a \"+\"), with credits from commenters who pointed the details out!', 'Kinkbeer', 'LegendsZA', 'https://reddit.com/r/LegendsZA/comments/1omser2/i_ended_up_replaying_the_entirety_of_pokémon_y_to/', 2548, 229, '2025-11-03 03:47:01', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

My husband and I have been together for 8 years. For some context The girls have a mom who\'s just not active in their life, she comes around once a year or every other year and stays for 2 to 3 months and then leaves. The problem is when she comes in town the girls change, for example after me and their dad got married they started calling me mom as they felt I was their mom, but when their mom came back they would stop and call her mom and push me to the side I understood why they did that then as they were young and confused and was trying to please her.\n\nWe put them in therapy and their therapist had them apologize and they tried to explain it. The next two times it happened she told me to try and have a talk with them. Their mom decided not to come for the next 2 years and it was a really peaceful 2 years the kids were good enjoying school their new brother and were just happy. This year their mom decided to come. She came in August and stayed until about a week ago. This time when she came the girls changed completely it started with not calling me mom, to saying disrespectful things to me and their dad, to them telling their brother they didn\'t like him and that he wasn\'t their real brother, and some other stuff, but the main thing they said that really hurt was I wasn\'t their mom and that I would never be and that I\'m a bad step mom and their mom is their only mom.\n\nSo last week when their mom left, they slowly tried to crawl back and tried to start calling me mom again and I told them I didn\'t want them to call me that anymore. They looked shocked when I said that and asked why, I told them that they told me multiple times that I\'m not their mom and that I\'m a bad step mom and that their mom is only their mom, so I said I no longer view you as my kids. They looked hurt and went to tell their dad what was said and he said its between us, their therapist thinks i was harsh but I don\'t, as they are old enough to realize what\'s wrong to say and what\'s right. So aitah?\n\nNote: I also want to put I don\'t blame the younger one as much as I blame the older one, as she should know better, and I understand things with parents are hard but I was younger than her when I cut my father off, and he was similar to how their mom is. The rose colored glasses should be faded or fading by now as shes old enough to understand.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed responses of NTAs, YTAs, and ESHs**\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Downvoted Commenter:** Info: when their mother is around and they treat you like this where is their father in that and what are you both saying while they’re doing that behaviour?\n\nIt reads as if this is the first time you’ve ever laid out the inevitable consequence of being treated like this and you’re enforcing it straight up, which is an asshole move.\n\nBut the response of your husband that this is “between you” is a complete abdication of his responsibility here.\n\nLike E S H but I’m leaning towards the hierarchy of assholes is:\n\n1) Your husband\n\n2) You\n\n3) The 16yo\n\nAnd the 13yo is just following what her mother and sister want.\n\nBut congratulations you’ve proved the ex right - id guess she alienates them from you by telling them that you’re not there for them unconditionally and well, that’s true.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** When they\'re doing that behavior he will punish them take their stuff away. This is not the first time I\'ve made consequences for them doing this stuff just last time it was less of extreme as what they said then was less extreme.\n\n**Commenter 1:** It sounds like their mom is in their ear telling them stuff, probably lies, about you and their dad. That\'s what it seems like is happening every time their mom shows up, they probably miss her and want her validation so they listen to her.\n\n**Commenter 2:** This biggest thing that stood out to me is that your husband had nothing to say except it’s between the 3 of you. What the girls said to you and what you said to them was all very hurtful and your husband shouldn’t be turning a blind eye to this. These words are relationship-altering and he should be intervening to try and keep his family together and work it out.\n\nI understand where you’re coming from and why you said what you did. I can’t say for sure if I would have had the guts to say the words, but it sounds like they maybe needed to be said.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Your girls need to understand everyone even parents have feelings that can be hurt . My take is you need to navigate this because you’re stuck with these “mean girls” and you are their parent . I wouldn’t want them calling me Mom either because you don’t treat your mom that way . But we all know they are being influenced by bio mom and you need to be the bigger person in this situation. Be the positive influence on them but set those boundaries as to how you will accept being treated . Also kick your husband in the rear .\n\n**Commenter 4:** They told you repeatedly that you\'re not their mom. You\'re just finally believing them.\n\nThey are absolutely old enough to understand that relationships aren\'t a switch you can flip on and off whenever their bio mom decides to show up.\n\nYour husband is a bit of an AH here for not backing you up.\n\nNTA\n\n**Commenter 5:** Soft YTA, or rather, you\'re the grown up.\n\nYes 13 and 16 is old enough to know better, but teenagers aren\'t famously good at emotional empathy and they have a lot to cope with. In a way, they are like a toddler saying \"I hate you\". You know that the only response is \"well, I love you and always will\".\n\nTheir bio mom sounds toxic, unreliable and like she is demanding their loyalty. They are terrified that she will go away again, maybe for good, if they displease her or do anything \"wrong\". They aren\'t ready to decide (as an adult might) not to have this person in their lives, they\'re just blindly terrified of being abandoned again.\n\nYou are the stable, loving maternal presence in their lives. Prove that, unlike their bio mom, you aren\'t going to abandon them, even at their most unlovable. That doesn\'t mean \"put up with insults or bad behaviour\" but it does mean not punishing them by withdrawing your support.\n\nYou can calmly explain that they are free not to call you mom, but you will always love them and consider yourself their step mom. In the years to come, they will feel terrible about this, but don\'t punish them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/LFGqr1QpOi): **October 22, 2025 (one week later)**\n\nUpdate: Aitah for telling my stepkids that I no longer view them as my kids?\n\nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o79kfd/aitah_for_telling_my_stepkids_that_i_no_longer/\n\nI\'m back with an update and before I give the update I want to start by answering a few of the main questions I saw.\n\nI saw a lot of questions that asked \"why do we allow their mother in their lives\", I\'m not over that my husband feels like it\'s not on him to keep the girls from seeing her, he will ask if they want to and they say yes.\n\nAnother question I saw a lot of was why doesn\'t their dad say anything, he does he\'s taken away their things and has tried to have talks with them they just listen and block him out, the reason why he stayed out is because whenever they don\'t like something I tell them they run to him, he has said he does side with me on this but feels I was too hard on them.\n\nThe update:\n\nA few days after I posted this my husband and I sat down with the girls and I told them that I was sorry for what I said and that I worded it wrong. I told them I still view them as my kids they just aren\'t allowed to call me mom anymore and have to call me by my name now. I also told them that our relationship is broken and I didn\'t break it, I did help a little, but they broke it, and if they wanted it back to how it use to be they would have to rebuild it. I also told them they had to play with their brother for 3 hours and apologize to him (he\'s 4). They had a few more punishments, but we did talk to them and try to figure out what she says that influences them so much, we got the answer of i don\'t know. We told them that they can\'t be easily manipulated and especially the 16 yo with her going to college soon and trying to drive so we talked about things that could happen with that. We also told them they can\'t just say what they want to people and expect things to stay the same especially if its stuff that hurts people.\n\nThey apologized for the things they said and how they acted and said they wanted things to go back to normal, I told them that I would forgive them when they did the stuff with their brother first and that if they want a things back to normal then they would have to work for it. From what they said they don\'t want to see their mom for a long time. So they will go to their therapist soon and talk to her about this.\n\n**Edit:** I\'ve worded myself very wrong. They have to play with their little brother as an apology to him. He\'s 4 if they apologize he\'s going to say its okay and then continue to ignore them. So its not a punishment more of his apology.\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** \"my husband feels like it\'s not on him to keep the girls from seeing her, he will ask if they want to and they say yes.\" Your husband has failed his daughters in protecting them from someone who he knows damages them by continuously building up their hopes and dreams and crashes them time and time again by abandoning them. If he absolutely could not bring himself to not allow their mum in their lives whenever she pleased, he should have been far more vigilant and never allow them to be unsupervised with her. He didn\'t. And now you\'re all here. What a mess.\n\nI\'d maybe cut out the \"punishment\" of having to play with their brother; definitely keep the punishments for speaking down to him, make it clear we do not talk to others like that in this household, but don\'t make him the object of their resentment. He deserves better than to be utilized as a tool for punishment, even if the objective is to create a better relationship. Encourage it, don\'t harm it by making it a chore.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I gave the punishment of playing with their brother because an apology won\'t mean much to him as he\'s 4. He will probably forgive them and just keep avoiding them like he\'s doing, so I feel like playing with him would help re build their relationship and would be a better apology to him. Also they don\'t have to play with him for the 3 hours I would take 30 minutes as long they try to fix what was broken.\n\n**Commenter 2:** I understand what you are saying. It\'s not so much as a punishment as an apology. Like when a child hurts someone\'s feelings and the parent says, \"that was rude, you tell them sorry right now.\" Only your son is 4 and although I\'m sure he knows what sorry means, playing with him it will make him feel like everything is okay again with his sisters. And that\'s all you really want for him is to know and feel loved by his family.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes and also he just accepts anyone\'s apology no matter what, so playing or doing something he wants will feel more like an apology to him than saying sorry.\n\n**OOP\'s husband needs to consider about the supervised visits with the biological mother for his daughters**\n\n&gt; **OOOP:** He is considering it as he doesn\'t want this to happen again.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Taking away the title of \"mom\" is a wildly insane punishment. It\'s so so horrible for a child. They\'ll never forget that. It\'s not making amends.\n\nOP has failed these children. She\'s trying to get away with it.\n\nAs a mother myself with a horrible mom I\'ve tried to undo damage from for 20 years....it makes me sick to know what these young girls must be feeling.\n\nTelling someone not to call you \"mom\" when your the functional mother figure is DISTURBING.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I took it away as I don\'t need it, I don\'t need them to be confused on who to call mom when they want to please their bio mom by calling her mom and then trying to use the word mom as weapon towards me. Again I know I\'m their mom I don\'t need a word to tell me that, but I\'m not going to let them use the word as a weapon towards me.\n\n**Commenter 4:** They are children, honey. You are weaponizing your power over them because you\'re insecure. They are abused and confused kids. You need to apologize immediately for this incredible horror you\'ve wrought. You don\'t get to do that if you want these girls in your life. That\'s not something you take away as any punishment. It\'s inviolable.\n\nTheir biological mother is horrendous. If you are worthy to replace her, be worthy.\n\nOtherwise you are condemning them to suffering. This is like withholding food or toileting as a punishment. We just don\'t do that.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It\'s not a punishment, that\'s the thing. I can choose what I want to be called the same way they can. They have been calling me by name for weeks by choice when their mom was around, I\'d rather them continue and their mom can have the word mom.\n\n**Commenter 5:** I\'m glad you and your spouse were able to reach an agreement to help the girls understand that actions have consequences. I suggest you frame the time they spend with their brother as atonement or a consequence, rather than punishment, though. The very last thing your household needs is strife that causes a 4 year-old to think he\'s somehow at fault for the tension.\n\nTeamwork and communication, like that displayed by you and your husband, is the best way to teach and show by example.

(189, 'reddit', '1ogp4j2', 'My boyfriend single-handedly saved my \"friends\" poorly planned disaster wedding', 'My \"best friend\" of 23 years announced in July she was engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. I honestly didn\'t think our friendship was that close after being out of high school for 18 years, but I said yes. \n\nPlanning started fine, but slowly devolved into chaos. \"S\" is extremely particular, wanting everything for her wedding at her exact specifications, while also having a dime store budget (straight up cheap). She insisted she host the reception in her LDS church gym, while also declaring it \"hideous\" and insisting on ordering full-wall floor to ceiling pipe and draping and ceiling bistro lights. Despite wanting this, she was unwilling to pay for it and also bemoaned the expense.  \n\n I finally stepped back from wedding planning in August because she was too demanding and exhausting. I told her my boyfriend and I would be happy to help her with some of the wedding setup the day prior (so she could order the cheaper pipe and drape package) and left her to her own planning devices. I did throw her a bridal shower last weekend with the help of her cousin. \n\nFast forward 8 weeks...she didn\'t even get her invitations sent out until 3 weeks before the wedding!! She had a 250 person guest list, insisting all of them would come and she decided to not serve actual food, so was only doing cheesecakes and then wedding sheet cake. My boyfriend tried to tell her double dessert was not a good idea but she was ADAMANT. She told us to be at the LDS church at 7 am the day before the wedding. My boyfriend and I were confused why she needed us that early, but figured it would be maybe 4 hours setting up tables and chairs, putting her linens on, putting down centerpieces, and then assembling the pipe and drape and be done. \n\nShe gave me a list of 8 people who were all supposed to be there to setup, but no one except us and her fiance showed up. My boyfriend very quickly and efficiently got all the tables shoved into orientation, I got chairs out. \"S\" bounced around the room in a panic, unable to decide how she wanted to configure tables. Her fiance stood there and watched. Finally, after half an hour of S changing her mind on table placement, my boyfriend said \"Nope! We arent changing it. This orientation is beautiful and you will love it.\" (because he has far better communication skills than me). She was even panicking that the 6 FOOT LONG gifts table wouldn\'t be large enough to hold all her gifts. My boyfriend had to leave the room to not laugh. I assured her, it would be fine.\n\nI thought we were close to being done...WRONG. This woman apparently didn\'t do ANYTHING until THAT DAY. She purchased a bunch of cheap dollar store crap, put it all in a giant tote and left it. She ordered linens from shein and just put them as-is in her box. She didnt open them, check them, iron them...NOTHING. At 830, she opens this box and proceeds to tell us she needs all the leaves cut off the garland because she wants them loose on the tables. She wanted pumpkins glued to her centerpieces, tea lights needed to be opened, batteries installed, she needed 27 tablecloths and table runners ironed, napkins ironed, oh and she needed to FIGURE OUT HER BOUQUET.  \n\nI about died when I saw the sheer lack of prep she had done. My boyfriend was fuming. S was at that point completely incapable of even figuring out where to start. she needed someone to go to Costco to buy 9 cheesecakes, go to the bakery 45 minutes away and pick up the wedding cake and the sheet cake, she needed someone to PURCHASE WEDDING FLOWERS AND ASSEMBLE THEM into a wedding bouquet 😱😱  She wanted me to go to a florist and call her on zoom to show her the flowers while she sat at the venue waiting for the pipe and drape delivery. \n\nMy boyfriend said straight up no. He told her we would go to Costco, we would buy all white flowers and her cheesecakes (she claims she will repay us). She begged us to call on zoom to show her flowers and he said \"we are doing all white. Text us the flowers you hate so we can avoid them. Bye we gotta move fast!\" She tried to ask if we could go to several different ones to find irises and he very kindly told her no. If she wanted irises, she should have ordered flowers. She gets what costco has but \"dont worry, it\'s going to be beautiful and you will love it!\" We then ran the errands- Costco cheesecakes, sauces, flowers, ribbon, floral pins. Her job was to go home and get her iron and board. She said she was going to throw some of the tablecloths in her dryer with a wet towel to try to steam the wrinkles. Perfect. \n\nWe came back at 10:30 am...she hadn\'t left. I don\'t even know what she was doing. My boyfriend and I then spent 2 hours building her a beautiful wedding bouquet. We found a pre-made bouquet that had some nice rust flowers and took a risk and bought it along with white roses. We had enough left over for bridesmaid bouquets too. Trust me when I say...this bouquet he made was GORGEOUS. I would not have been able to pull it off as well as him. He then pre-cut her cheesecakes, we assembled the pipe and drape, while she just freaked out around us. Her mom and sister showed up and I asked them to go to her house and put the linens in the dryer and RETURN WITH HER IRON. So they went to do that but then had to drive 45 minutes away to pick up her wedding cake and sheet cake. I told them to do that but please stop and get the iron. They didn\'t. \n\nShe didn\'t provide any food for us at all, so we left to eat lunch, returned at 1 pm to learn that she actually didn\'t own an iron. They had the wedding cake and a 96 person sheet cake. The wedding cake barely fit in the fridge alongside the cheesecakes. The sheet cake was way too big. We had to just leave it on the counter and hope the buttercream held up overnight. We still had rehearsal dinner to get ready for (paid for by finances family). We finally just had to leave and I said I would come back to the church after the dinner and help her iron. \n\nDinner took entirely too long. I sent my boyfriend home because I could tell he was exhausted (and he really doesn\'t even know her). Then she hit me with this bombshell: she wasn\'t going to the church to help us iron. She was moving out of her parents house into her finances apartment that night. Her sister and I tried to tell her that she didn\'t need to do that. Just go on the honeymoon and move the rest of the stuff when she came home. It was her parents house. Her stuff was fine. But she was ADAMANT she HAD to get all her stuff into his apartment that night. I finally left the dinner to go to the church and start ironing and I called my mom and griped about it for 30 minutes. So then MY MOM drove over to help me. \n\nThe rest of the night was me, my mom, S\'s disabled sister and her 80 year old mother ironing linens with my iron, my mom\'s iron, and a cheap steamer we bought at Walmart. She left me with a written list of instructions for how to set up each table to her exact specifications. She left all of the bridesmaids dresses, her petticoat and HER WEDDING DRESS hanging in the church for me to steam and then told us to bring them to her moms house. I didn\'t even leave until 1 am. I was fumed that she didn\'t even get her stupid dress professionally steamed. And after all of that, this chick FORGOT HER BOUQUET IN THE CHURCH FRIDGE after I explicitly told her to bring it home with her. I didn\'t even think about it until 5 am, and I broke down crying at 5 am because I new she was going to call and ask me to drive up to get her bouquet for her and I didn\'t even know when I would have time for that.  \n\nShe called me the next morning asking me to drive 45 minutes to unlock the church for her to get her bouquet. Keep in mind, i was not invited to the wedding because it was at the LDS temple and I am a heathen. Then told me she needed me and my boyfriend to get to the reception church 2 hours early, finish setup, get all the lighting figured out, then manage her food table during the reception- cutting and plating cheesecake and sheet cake, applying caramel or fruit drizzle, bringing it to the tables, keeping water refreshed, etc. She wanted me to do it because \"her family would obviously want to mingle with guests\". She didn\'t plan anything for water dispensers, she didn\'t have a cake tray to even put her turquoise wedding cake on. So I brought my serving ware from my house- our cake tray, glass water dispensers and pitchers. My mom was so pissed on my behalf she un-rsvp\'ed herself to the wedding 🤣 but then she also loaned me her glass wated dispensers too. S also needed us to buy ice for the dispensers, buy and slice lemons...I just stopped caring at that point. She did not get lemon water at her reception. \n\nThe reception was basically me and my boyfriend and 2 of our children acting as unpaid cater waiters. She was 1 hour late to her reception because she didnt plan time for photos outside the temple, and forgot to leave the guest book with me. So I spent an hour trying to entertain angry guests, explaining where the guest book was, explaining where the bride was. No one wanted to eat cheesecake until she arrived. Her dopey fiance left their rings at his house and he arrived 30 minutes after her because he had to drive to get them. At one point, cheesecakes were running low and someone walked up to me and said \"S notice the cheesecake table needs to be refreshed, thanks!\" S\'cuse me WHAT?!\n\nShe then had photos going on outside the reception church- 4 pages of shots she wanted. The photographer did them backwards and instead of starting big and widdling down, she started small and went big so everyone was outside standing around for an hour while the other guests sat inside alone confused. I was outside for the bridesmaid photo while my boyfriend managed the food. She then came back in, cut the cake, and changed to leave. She asked me to box up any remaining cheesecakes and wrap and box her wedding cake and ALL of the leftover sheet cake (which her mother paid for) and bring it out for her to take home with her. No surprise, people didn\'t want double dessert. Of 9 cheesecakes, we had 4 untouched ones leftover, the entire wedding cake (minus 1 slice), and almost the entire sheet cake- basically 90 of 96 slices. Yes...this woman was fully planning on taking home all 4 leftover cheesecakes (that we bought), an entire 96-person sheet cake, AND her wedding cake, somehow fit them in her tiny fridge and hope they would be OK when she got back from her trip in a week. She was not going to share any of this leftover food with her bridal party or family- all of whom single handedly built her reception from the ground up. \n\nMy boyfriend was incredulous. He was actually cursing in the church he was so mad at her greed and entitlement. He said f*ck no. He took her wedding cake and put it back in its box for her. He didn\'t wrap it in plastic or anything. He took 2 cheesecakes and put them straight into the trunk of our car for us to bring with us to a family dinner tonight. Then he boxed up half of the remaining sheet cake in an extra cake box for me to bring to work this morning to share with people. The remaining sheet cake he boxed up for anyone willing to stay after to take down the wedding. \n\nS was fully out the door on her way to the Anniversary Inn to lose her v card and left me, my boyfriend, her family, and several kind ward members to clean up, take down all the pipe and draping, box up her centerpieces, linens, and then clean the church. We got home around 6 pm Saturday, physically in pain and angry and gave all of our kids full stars for their chore charts (they get a prize at 10 stars so they each got a full 10 stars). \n\nI dont even feel like I attended the wedding. I feel like I catered her wedding against my will. My boyfriend did a bulk majority of the work- assembling the backdrops, tables, breaking it all down, all heavy lifting, making 5 bouquets (which I learned he is excellent at), running the entire catering operation, cleaning the kitchen...I steamed 5 bridesmaid dresses and the wedding dress and ironed 27 tablecloths. Many family members thanked us personally for the work we put in. S\'s mom cried and thanked us for saving the wedding and said she prays for our family and for our health and happiness every morning. The fiances family thanked us and said we did well, and even offered to pay us money, which honestly felt so weird because they 100% should have thrown money at hiring Actual  reception staff (or better yet..AN ACTUAL RECEPTION VENUE). S gave us a quick thanks and bounced off. I don\'t expect to hear from her for months. \n\nEverything about her wedding felt so cheap and tacky- dollar tree decorations (plastic lanterns with plastic pumpkins glued on the day before), wrinkly teal shein table cloths and runners, hosted in the \"free\" church gym, complete with basketball hoop. Her wedding cake was teal with orange pumpkins piped on the top. Of her 250 person guest list, about 100 came. There were maybe 7 gifts total on the table and 4 cards (I assume most people used Amazon\'s option to ship to the couple\'s address). My boyfriend said \"it\'s giving Mormon pregnancy wedding\" which we thought was hilarious because we are all 36 and definitely too old for this mid 2000\'s cheap dollar general pinterest board wedding vibe nonsense.

We’re skimming hundreds of resume a day looking for 3 things:\n1. The title matches.\n2. The company stage matches.\n3. The problem space matches.\nThat’s it. If you hit all three, you make it to the human-reviewed pile. (Yes, I’m a checked box recruiter)\n\nIf you have no experience, we’ll look at your projects. If you have no projects, RIP.\nNow let’s be real about a few things:\n\n- Referrals are overhyped.Used to be the secret weapon. Not anymore. Some companies get 20%+ of applicants through referrals, so many that they removed bonuses completely. Everyone’s referring everyone. It’s crowded. Don’t spend too much time to get one.\n- ATS isn’t about your GPA or school filterIt’s all about keywords. Half of resume get filtered out because they don’t match the JD language. Find someone working your dream role and straight up copy their keywords, job title, tech stack, phrasing.\n\nIf you’re applying right now:\n* Apply asap, within 3–5 days max of posting.\n* Use company portals / apply directly, don’t use 3rd party, they are tryin to collect your data while company preferred direct application on the portal \n* Fix your resume keywords!!\nSo many CS students asked me on Linkedin and I’m tired of random coffee chat so Imma share it here. I’ll answer anything honestly, job search myths, internal hiring politics, or what recruiters actually say in Slack.

(191, 'reddit', '1olells', 'Entitled Siblings Are Convinced Mom Has A Secret Stash Of Money', '**I am NOT OOP, OOP is u/headfullofpain**\n\n**Originally posted to r/EntitledPeople**\n\n**Entitled Siblings Are Convinced Mom Has A Secret Stash Of Money**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!death of a loved one, emotional abuse and manipulation, harassment, medical scare, entitlement, favoritism, elder abuse!&lt;\n\n**Mood Spoilers:** &gt;!worrying!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/JUz08kdmBs): **July 30, 2025**\n\nMy brother, SIL, sister and BIL feel as if Mom should give them her house and property and move into an old folks\' home. Or buy them a house. My Mom is almost 80. She has all of her faculties about her. She is well educated and very spry. It\'s mostly my Sister and brother causing all the trouble.\n\nA few years ago, my stepdad passed. He was a great guy and good to my Mom. My older brother and my younger sister are convinced that Mom has secret money left to her when (step)Dad died. At first, they thought she had cash hidden in the house. So they\'d visit her, and one would keep her busy while the other would \"snoop\". Then they convinced themselves that she had a secret bank account somewhere.\n\nNo, she doesn\'t. I do most of her banking and set up her accounts for autopay. She owns her house free and clear. After Dad died, I orchestrated a GoFundMe to get her house paid off. We were successful. They do not know that I did this. They were kept out of the loop for fear they\'d pressure her into giving them some of the money. So they have no idea HOW she paid her house off, only that she had paid it off. They really ramped up the pressure after she paid off the house. Now they are convinced more than ever that she has a secret stash of money.\n\nThen we told them about the GoFundMe for her house, hoping they would back off of Mom. But they lost it. They wanted an accounting of the money, and they wanted anything that was in that account turned over to them. Threatening to take me to court for elder financial abuse.\n\nNow she only has to pay the monthly bills. I set up her auto pay. So I know exactly how much money she has. Enough to live but not to have any fun. So, I pay her water and cellphone bills for her. I transfer the money to her account every month. They have each told her she needs to give them money for a down payment on a house since she \"refuses\" to give up her home of 35 years. If she won\'t give them any money, then give up an acre to them each. How are they entitled to her money? She receives less than 4K a month to live on. I can not convince them that she doesn\'t have a secret bank account.\n\nThe thing that they do not understand is that he is not our bio father and he didn\'t raise us. They married when we were all out of the house. No matter how many times I point this out, they say that it doesn\'t matter, since they called him Dad. It\'s been a few years, but they still bring it up often. Mom called me last night. She was tired and had worked hard today in her High Tunnel. Both of them had been calling for the last few weeks, upping the pressure. The last time they brought it up, they talked about splitting her house and property between the two of them. Also mentioning her secret bank account.\n\nUh, there are 5 siblings altogether. BUT since the other three (houses and careers) are doing better than these two, they think they are entitled to her home and property after she passes.\n\nWhat they do not know is that she left her house and 5 acres to an animal rescue/activist group that she is very active in. I know because I am the executor of the will. She has asked me not to tell them.\n\nHow do I get them to back off of her without telling them there\'s not a snowball\'s chance in Hell that they are getting anything? She does not want them to know about her will, for fear they will harass the animal rescue activist group.\n\n**Editor\'s note: OOP has answered lots of questions, posting the common questions and responses**\n\n**Some Relevant Comments**\n\n**Can OOP\'s mother look into getting restraining orders and blocking OOP\'s siblings\' numbers?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I\'ve mentioned that to her several times she worked in the legal system for a few decades.And understands how it works. She’s not interested in cutting them off in any way at all, she dearly loves all of her children.\n\n**Commenter 1:** You might consider reaching out to your local version of Adult Protective Services or other elder social services with your county or state. If you think she is at risk for fraud or other scamming influences, they can advise how to protect her or at least document things should it escalate later.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That\'s what somebody else advised. I didn\'t know that you could call them to ask for advice. I thought you only called them to report abuse. This is great advice and I will be doing this first thing in the morning.\n\n**Why is OOP sharing those information with her siblings about their mother?** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** I only share what she allows me to share. My sister\'s the youngest and my brother\'s the oldest. Those two have always been the golden children. I\'m smack dab in the middle, so i\'m the people pleaser. I try to keep everybody happy all of the time. She really doesn\'t want to cut contact with them.Because then she feels she\'ll lose contact with the grandkids and the great grandkids. She doesn\'t want that on their conscience, when she passes. My mom is intelligent and well educated. But she\'s also extremely stubborn. Once she\'s made up her mind, it\'s almost impossible to change it.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Make sure a lawyer looks at the will. In some jurisdictions leaving a family member out of a will entirely (with no mention of why they are left out) can open it up to being contested. In some places you leave a token amount to demonstrate that they weren’t forgotten.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Several people have mentioned this and I will go over that with her tomorrow. And then we\'ll contact the lawyer that created the will and see about adding them and giving them a buck each.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Did the witnesses to her signing the will also sign self-proving affidavits, that she is of sound mind and was not under any duress when she signed the will and that she knows what is in it?\n\nOne of the ways that greedy relatives successfully contest wills is through the witnesses. They make courts track down the witnesses to get them to either clearly remember your mother signing the will or not remember her and possibly tossing out the will. There\'s also the strong possibility that witnesses are dead or have moved and cannot be found, putting the validity of the will in jeopardy.\n\nWitnesses to signing wills are often employees in the lawyer\'s office, who don\'t know you and will have a difficult time testifying in court that they remember you and your state of mind when you signed a will\n\nhttps://www.freewill.com/learn/self-proving-affidavit\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes! We made sure she was well covered in this aspect because we knew there was going to be issues down the road. And to be honest with you, the house is in disarray, it\'s falling apart around her, it needs to be razored. It’s the property that\'s worth real money. It\'s in a prime location in Alaska.\n\n**Commenter 4:** You need a really good estate lawyer. Get POA over everything concerning your mom. Maintain detailed financial records and transactions with your mom\'s money. That way, they can\'t accuse you of financial mismanagement. I hope you are on all of her accounts.\n\nYour mom needs to go LC with them. If you have not done so, put up hidden cameras around your mom\'s house and place nanny cams in the house with a link to all cameras to your phone.\n\nThe stress could cause her to have a heart attack or stroke. Take care\n\n&gt; **OOP:** This is all great advice. We do have cameras up. That\'s how we caught them snooping. Unfortunately after that they know there\'s cameras. Yes, my name is on all of her accounts. And I do keep an accounting of everything online on my computer. Which they do not have access to.\n\n**What is a High Tunnel?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It\'s a type of greenhouse. It\'s huge and it\'s like a tunnel. She got it through a government program.\n\n**OOP on her mother and the charity (animal rescue/activist group)**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She\'s an old farm girl that just loves animals. ❤️ right now, she has three husky pit bull mixes. About a dozen cats she fosters and helps to place in permanent homes. But we grew up with parrots, chickens, geese, ducks, pigs, an occasional goat, lots of dogs, lots of cats, and aquariums. She used to be one of the premier bird rescues, and we have helped foster and rehabilitate crows and eagles.\n\n**OOP should get the locks changed for her mother for good measures so her siblings cannot get in** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** You know, that\'s a good idea. It is time for her to get new locks on her doors. I\'m gonna text my husband and see what he thinks because he can just change them for her. Thank you\n\n**Any chances that OOP\'s siblings were the golden children as of today?** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** The youngest was definitely babied. She was born after a miscarriage, and she was a twin. Her twin died at birth.\n\n**Commenter 5:** These are the kind of people who will break into the property and steal any paperwork looking for bank accounts and safety deposit boxes, and dump the closets and mattresses looking for hidden safes. Talk to your mom about distributing any personal gifts before she passes (like giving away jewelry she wants to go to specific grandchildren etc) as Christmas or graduation gifts. Resign yourself to this not ending well, and consider security cameras for your property too.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** This. I firmly believe that they would try to steal paperwork if they could find it. Luckily, we had moved out her major paperwork after dad had died. It\'s in a safety deposit box.\n\n**OOP\'s reason for the GoFundMe after her stepfather\'s passing. Was her mother destitute?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yes, she was. His first wife took almost everything. She had let his insurance expire (big mistake), and she was behind on a reverse mortgage and was going to lose the house for less than 20K. I tried to reason with the title company, but they wanted her home for the land. Her land alone is worth a pretty penny, probably close to a quarter million. I set up a GoFundMe to keep her in her home. And at the time, I figured we\'d sell everything later for her if she needed it to live on. But she is very active and very spry still. Everyone who donated to the GoFundMe was other family and friends. One close family friend who had worked with my mom for a decade put up 10K herself. I donated 2500. This was the easiest way to reach her family in the States at the time. You try living on 4K a month in a remote village in Alaska.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/OgThPMPjiH): **October 25, 2025 (nearly three months later)**\n\nUpdate to Entitled Siblings Are Convinced Mom Has A Secret Stash Of Money\n\nUpdate: So Many things have changed since my first post. My mom became very ill with vertigo, edema, and went into a-fib. She spent three days in the hospital. They think that there is an issue with her pacemaker. But she and her doctor also suspect her high blood pressure meds. She needs to go to a specialist. She heads there tomorrow.\n\nDuring that time, the cat rescue that she WAS leaving her house and property to basically turned their back on her and didn\'t go in to help her with the animals that she was caring for. Animals that were dropped off by the rescue. She had to scramble to find outside help and pay for it when the rescue was supposed to help her. Apparently, the rescue had lost a large grant, and they are now telling fosters that they are on their own.\n\nMy mom is fiesty, and that pissed her off, so she decided she\'s not leaving them the property and house anymore. She has decided to make me executor of the will with the stipulation that I will sell the property and divide the proceeds among her grandkids and great-grandkids. I will follow her wishes to the letter. She has directed me not to tell any of them what she plans, to let them still think that it is going to a rescue.\n\nAs for you all asking about her income, she lives remotely in Alaska. Her closest store is 35 miles away, one way. If she wants a Walmart, she has to drive 70 miles one way. Her electricity alone is 600-800 a month. Plus, groceries are outrageous. She also has a lot of animals. They keep her alive and happy. She gives 10 percent to her church and another 10 percent to charities. She has to pay for car payments, auto insurance, house insurance, water bill, and gas for the truck. If there is anything left, she puts it on an account at the vet so she has a buffer in case one of her animals needs the vet.\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Probably stating the obvious but if her will states the property and house go to the rescue she MUST change the will.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She knows. She is in the process.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Odd timing that her health should change now. Have the Entitleds been visiting?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No we are pretty sure the change was brought on by her high blood pressure meds. She is still going to the heart specialist tomorrow.\n\n**Commenter 3:** If she\'s struggling for money, why the donations?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Her church replaced her French drain, replaced her hot water heater, and bought her a hospital bed. So she firmly believes in tithes, as for the other charity, it\'s animal rescues.

(192, 'reddit', '1ojjxl4', 'A list of valid reasons that the community is concerned with how Cyrene was handled', 'There\'s an influx of posts about how everyone is seemingly wrong for wanting more out of Hoyoverse. I figured it would be helpful to list the objective reasons that people are not okay with the direction they took with the penultimate character of Amphoreus.\n\n1. **Cyrene only works in Chrysos Heirs teams.** Her kit is literally tied to them by name. Her general buffing is pitiful, it\'s so bad that you can\'t really even use her unless you want to downgrade your team or spend 300+ pull tickets pulling her &amp; her e2\n   - You thought the anti-break mechanics in 3.X was bad, HoYo doesn\'t even need to artificially nerf remembrance teams in 4.X. They just need to release new dps units to nerf her\n   - Right now the shill end game buffs will favor her, and her teams, but that will not last forever\n2. **Cyrene\'s Ultimate takes too long to charge** in a multitude of common scenarios, and specifically in a team without Hyacine or without at least 2-3 other chrysos heirs\n3. **Locked her \"fix my kit\" eidolon behind e2**\n4. She\'s **not an expected level of upgrade in some chrysos heirs teams**. And if you take one chrysos heir out of the comparison team, her value drops noticeably. The concern of her future value is that she\'s team locked\n5. You thought the relationship shill with Firefly was bad (I say as an e2 firefly enjoyer)? Oh boy did HoYo outdo themselves **trying to market her as the players wife**. Even the breaks in the Livestream has her seductively speaking to the viewer (maybe this isn\'t a new trend, but I don\'t remember this in past live streams)\n6. Her skin **requiring spending $250 USD** without top up bonus is unbelievably greedy (even Firefly\'s costume cost 1/10th the cost and at least changes her outfit)\n7. **No top up reset** before another spending event is greedy. No, you don\'t get it for \"free\". It requires people who most likely wouldn\'t have spent money before anniversary reset now have to spend money to acquire it\n8. Her skin being **just a weapon skin** that barely changes anything is greedy. They could have just released her small model as a skin for same cost as firefly skin. Or actually develop a real skin like they have in their other games.\n9. The **live stream used her e5 or e6** to display her \"strength\" because the developers knew how underwhelming her e0 would look on the screen. This is unprecedented, and it\'s shady to mislead players who expect to see low eidolon game play in the live stream.\n\nThese reasons are all valid. Why do I care? Because I really like Cyrene, and Hoyo is showing a trend of reducing player friendliness of HSR. I get that if it keeps selling Hoyoverse will keep doing it until it hits a point of negative return on investment.\n\nMaybe in 4.5 we\'ll have a $500 Screwllum brown hat recolor instead of the usual black, and it will activate a special buff for only Arlan to make him T1 that can do global attacks on any team. The players finally stop spending at this price point, and that\'s the stopping point for future skins. /sarcasm\n\nIf you like her, by all means pull her. Use her in your 3.X teams just like others use their break teams today. Maybe spend $250 on no top up bonus and get your wife bow. But I want to echo that it\'s completely valid to not pull her for lack of meta relevance, or because the terrible design decisions in her kit &amp; skin.\n\n**Bonus: Braxaphone goes over some of his issues as well:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIS9Z9Tz6AM', 'zatn', 'HonkaiStarRail', 'https://reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1ojjxl4/a_list_of_valid_reasons_that_the_community_is/', 2449, 517, '2025-10-30 05:19:48', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

But you were short listed and no one came or wanted you, so not fault of your own, you were put on deathrow.  \n\nIn the 12th hour a rescue came for you and saved you.  They named you Tank, I like to think it was because no matter what was in your way, you just bowled on through!  But you sat there too.\n\nOne day my father came to the rescue to look for another dog to add to his pack.  They took someone else home but it didn\'t work out, but as fate happens they saw you.  You played it cool and calm, maybe tricking them of your true husky ways.  Off you went to join the craziness of being 1 of 13 dogs.\n\nYou thrived there for 2 years, sleeping on tables and jumping on counters to get food thought to high for a dog. \nI met you on a visit down for Thanksgiving.  You just sat on your table and looked at me the entire time.  You were a handsome boy and you got lots of pets, even tried to get you to sleep next to me, but you had enough of that after 20 minutes.\n\nLive changed for me and I ended up moving to you.  It was an exhausting move in a blizzard, and when we finally returned the truck and I headed to my new home for now, you followed right there behind me and just like that you were my dog and I was your person.\n\nThe first year we went on hikes and generally hung out all the time.  You\'d always sleep back to back with me and be my shadow.  It was hard being alone in a new State, but it was worth it with you.  In that time I made the mistake of leaving for a few days, and you ran away to try and find me.  That would be the last time we were ever apart for more then 24 hours.\n\nCovid hit shortly after but so did some terrible things for you.  First you tore your ACL.  We got you a custom brace to heal instead of surgery, but on the day of your fitting, you started to act weird.  At first we thought you got poisoned but it turns out your flea and tick medicine messed up your head.  They couldn\'t figure out what was wrong, maybe a stroke?  You went nearly blind, couldn\'t walk straight and always to the right, forgot everything you were taught, and basically looked like you were shutting down.  I couldn\'t lose you at 6 years old and even though they suggested putting you to sleep, I took you home because I believed we could beat this!\n\nIt took nearly 14 days to get you back on track.  The first 5 days I held you when you\'d only sleep for 20 minutes at a time before you\'d get up and try to walk in circles hurting yourself.  Carry your 90 lbs butt up stairs in the winter to guild you around the yard in the dead of night. How to eat properly, you\'d drink your food and eat your water!  I was a wreck just getting nibbles of sleep between your sleep, but we did it buddy!  You survived, we worked 8 more months with your brace, and you returned mostly to normal.  You somehow learn to sleep on a pillow, and that\'s how it would always be.  You lost the cute upside-down sleepies, how to sit right, and all of your commands except, \"you gotta go out?\"\n\nSoon Covid started to settle down and it was time for work.  You were not thrilled with this at all, you\'d howl and cry when I left but some how you knew when I\'d be getting home and you\'d wait for me every day.  At work I met your mommy.  She wasn\'t a husky person, told me that day 1, kinda bummed me out.  But from the moment she met you, you changed her mind.  She put plopped down next to you in the parking lot, talking about your \'velvet ears.\'  You loved her almost as much as you loved me.  She even got you a sister after awhile so you wouldn\'t be lonely while we were working.  You weren\'t exactly thrilled, but from the moment you met her you were always gentle, even when she annoyed the heck out of you.\n\nWe had a lot of good years after that.  Went to different states to hike and camp, or just explore.  You loved a good mountain climb or a state park.  We just lived life my boy!  Until this year.\n\nWe started 2025 with lots of plans for more adventures, but we found a growth in your mouth.  You were hurting so bad and hurting yourself in the pain.  We kept taking you to places but no one could help us.  We finally took you to your old Vet who gave it to us straight.  It wasn\'t going to be easy, but to make sure it goes away for good, he knows a place but it\'s going to change you.  What could we do, it\'s this or death.  So you spent the first night alone in forever getting some harsh work done.  They took some of your teeth and a part of your skull, then used some of your lips to repair your mouth.  When I came to get you it was a gut punch.  I was so sorry for doing that to you, but it was the right choice.  You bounced back extremely well, even eating meatballs day 1.  A few months before your 12 birthday you got everything taken off and you were you again! You were so happy being outside and hiking again.\n\nBut today, today was terrible.  We were going to take you out for your first train ride to see the autumn colors.  Thursday we ran around after work like everything was great but you did have some bad poops.  It was so much worse the next morning, you threw up and pooped everywhere and it was bloody.  We spent the next 6 hours at the vet.  They didn\'t look too concerned and we thought you had a bug.  But alas, that was not the case.\n\nIt was a rough night of no sleep for either of us.  I held you because I knew what was coming.  I tried ignoring your mom when she said to take you back that morning because I knew what would happen.  Then you couldn\'t walk and I couldn\'t be selfish anymore, we had to go.  I had to carry you in and watch them take you away on a stretcher.  They said you were just going to keep on suffering, and I broke.  I had to sign the papers, then call your mom, we weren\'t winning this one buddy.\n\nYou went peacefully at noon, surrounded by me, your mom, and your sister.  The sun shining down on you, taking you home, where we\'ll see each other again.\n\n\n\n\nSorry about it being long, if you stayed, thanks for reading.  It was a little therapeutic to relive my boys life.  He was the best friend one could ever ask for, definitely my soul dog.  His first 2 years we don\'t think were very good at all, but his next 10 and a half definitely were.  8 years of him and me wasn\'t enough time but at the same time it was absolutely everything.\n\nSee you on the other side Thor, run free, love you.', 'V4R14N7', 'husky', 'https://reddit.com/r/husky/comments/1og3pb0/goodbye_thor_my_best_boy/', 2431, 69, '2025-10-26 03:50:51', '2025-11-07 23:43:30'),

Not the best video but I’m hoping my explanation helps', 'I posted Scooters success story and I noticed a few comments and received a few DM’s asking how I did it. This is the only video I took of me actively stretching him. I’m kicking myself looking back because if I had taken more videos I would have been able to explain it easier and help the community know how I did it😩 It’s okay though, I will work with what I’ve got!\n\nStretching started at around a week old since that’s how old he was when I got him. Every feeding(every 2 hours) I would lightly stretch his legs. I wouldn’t push it too far, just to where it would naturally stop stretching. To be honest, the stretches didn’t last a long time. I mostly just did it while he was distracted drinking(30-60 seconds). His patience was VERY thin since he clearly had places to be and sleep to catch up on🙄 there were times(like this video) where I would straight jacket him with an infant sock and do a more thorough stretch. He hated this the most but it helped me see exactly where we were at with stretching. \n\nOne thing I will note is that the last thing that was corrected were his ankles/paws. I focused mainly on stretching the length of his legs to correct the inward bend and focused on his paw position last. I was initially worried because he was starting to wobble around and putting weight on his newly corrected legs which means he was putting weight on his inward curved paws. This was when he was around 4-5 weeks old. This is where I started stretching with the intent of correction. This is how I did it:\n- Each feeding I would alternate which paw I worked on. \n- He would be fed belly down on a flat surface(my legs at times) and he would naturally splay his legs out behind him(splooting). \n- I would hike his legs up into a bent position as if he were loafing.\n- I would take his toe beans and put them in directly onto my pointer finger. \n-With my thumb I would press his ankle into the correct position and hold and release the pressure/correction. As his paw got used to this position, I would hold the stretch instead of pulsating it.\n\nI think the ankle position was also corrected along with the fact that he started walking. Once his ankle was more naturally in the correct position, he was able to put weight on it which stretched it naturally into the right position. \n\nI’m sorry for the rambling and the use of internet terms to explain this process😂 hopefully it creates an image of how I was able to do it. If anyone has questions, PLEASE comment them! I’m hoping this post can be a resource for anyone searching info on twisted leg syndrome.

My husband likes black and doesn’t even own a white shirt! i don’t have a white dress or shoes. I had to tell her that if she does this, we won’t be able to attend. We’re on fixed incomes and can’t afford to buy new clothing and shoes for somebody else’s wedding.\n\nHer mother is against her plan, too. She thinks it’s unfair to require a particular color unless a person is in the wedding party. Friend just snaps that “you have a year to save up” and thinks I’m being a bad friend. I’ve called men’s rental shops and we can’t find a white suit for rent for less than $75. I’m sure I’ll need as much or more for my dress and shoes, and that’s on top of shower and wedding presents. I don’t think I’m TA for RSVPing with regrets when it’s time. What do y’all think?\n\n**Verdict: No Assholes Here**\n\n**UPDATE:** For all of you who just think I’m fishing for an excuse not to go: THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL. We’re on disability and income is a big issue for us. We are still going to send them a nice wedding and shower gift - and that’s going to stretch us too, because one place setting of her china and crystal is $150 a pop! This is NOT something we “just don’t want to do.”\n\nWhenever I’m asked to be somebody’s bridesmaid I have to regretfully decline too. Just can’t afford a dress, shoes, hair, makeup, manicure , a share of the shower and bachelorette costs AND gifts. I was upset when I heard about this because I knew we’d have to decline.\n\nWe already went to her engagement party and bought a gift for that. There are limits to what we can afford. Believe me, we’re disappointed too.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Why wouldn’t you find these clothes at a consignment store? This really shouldn’t be that hard. Did you even check consignment stores or any other very cheap or free options (gift groups on Facebook, charity, family and friends, Vinted etc.)?\n\n&gt; **OOP**  I already buy most of our wardrobe at consignment and eBay. The only white formals I saw at my usuall haunts were wedding dresses!\n&gt; \n&gt; She’s a longtime friend, but all caught up in Instagram, influencers, and “Ahh want my wedding to be yooooo-neek!” She was talking about the bridal party before he even proposed, how much fun we’d all have hanging out together at the bachelorette (Myrtle Beach weekend, by the way) when I told her to please not ask me because I can’t afford it. I think part of this is she is still pissed about that. I’d love to, but just can’t. She went off on me to her mom, which is how I know her mom disapproves. Her sister called me afterward and apologized to me for both of them. Sis and mom told her it was a bad idea that will cause them to lose guests, and her photos will look like awful if everything is all one color.\n&gt; \n&gt; My husband told me to just look for something for me and he will just not go. (Which will piss her off too)\n&gt; \n&gt; The wedding is next year so maybe she will come back down to Earth by then.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Do you even like your friend? You sound very resentful… If this actually was about money I’d understand it a little but your responses are dripping with content. She doesn’t need to change her whole plan just because you don’t like the idea. That’s a ridiculous ask, especially from a so-called friend.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She has undergone a crazy personality change ever since she got engaged. She was talking wedding before he even proposed. The wedding is NEXT YEAR but she went out and created her wedding registry the same week she got engaged!! She had a big engagement party and has planned all sorts of activities for the next year! I am happy for her, but think some of her expectations are unreasonable, like the one-color wedding. She wants her bridesmaids to buy their dresses which will just hang in the closet for the next year! She’s 34 and is pissed because her parents aren’t chipping in more for her costs. It’s getting out of hand. We are longtime friends but I think it is her who is losing sight of this. She knows my $ situation.\n\n**Commenter 3:** NTA for not going you can make some excuse but if people are telling her how to plan her own wedding then they would be TA.\n\n&gt; **OOP** It’s not her plans. It’s her expectations. She got hopping mad when I said to please not ask me to be in the wedding (she wanted me for matron and her helper for planning) and I said to please not ask me to be in the bridal party. I will gladly help her plan. She has a busy career while I’m home and can make calls, etc. The bridesmaid dress she picked (already!) is $200 and the shoes are almost another hundred. That’s just the clothes! She wants a bach in Myrtle Beach and a shower with catered sushi.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[My (now ex) Friend\'s Wedding All-White Formal Wedding](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/s/cC3Yx2nUvd): **June 26, 2025 (nearly three years later)**\n\nI posted this years ago on the lower anatomical body part forum (this one won\'t let me use the name). I\'m updating it with the eventual outcome.\n\nFriend got engaged and started planning her wedding. She was in her thirties and it was not her first wedding. Before everybody squeals, I DO NOT think it\'s wrong for a repeat bride to have a big, formal wedding. That is NOT the issue. What I DO feel was that some of her expectations were unreasonable, given her age and the ages and life circumstances of her friends.\n\nShe got pissed with me right from the start. I declined being a bridesmaid because I\'m on disability and didn\'t think I could afford the dress, a share of the shower and the bachelorette party, plus shower and wedding gifts. I was also afraid my disability would inconvenience her because I have chronic pain, and I never know how I\'m going to feel from one day to the next. It makes trying to plan anything a pain in the ass. There was a high chance that I\'d let her down on helping with wedding work and going to appointments.\n\nI thought she\'d understand but she was majorly pissed! She said I had a year to save up for my wedding attire. I have an opinion on that but kept it to myself and apologized for disappointing her.\n\nShe wanted a destination bachelorette party. The bridesmaids and her friends are all married with kids. I don\'t think it was reasonable to expect us to head off for a week at Myrtle Beach. A weekend, sure, but not an entire week. The expense was another no-go for me.\n\nI did what I could to support her. We attended her engagement party and brought a gift, which wasn\'t cheap. Read on.\n\nShe registered for China, crystal, the works. I know that\'s not a faux pas - but she had a full set from her first wedding. She just wanted new stuff. This is where I admit that I might be the lower anatomical blowhole. I feel that asking her friends for such pricey gifts for the second wedding was unfair.\n\nOkay, now on for the real big deal: six months from the wedding, she decided to ask her guests to dress in all-white formal attire.\n\nI told her that if she did that, we wouldn\'t be able to come. Now, I have cocktail and formal clothing, but not in all-white. My husband likes black and doesn’t even own a white shirt! That meant a new suit and shoes for him, a new evening gown for me. If I could afford this I could\'ve been her bridesmaid.\n\nI did make an effort, though.\n\nI called men\'s formalwear shops and renting a white suit for him would cost around $75. I looked at consignment stores for an evening gown and the only all-white long dresses WERE wedding gowns.\n\nHer mom and sister tried to talk her out of this. Her mom thought (and I agree) that requiring a particular color isn\'t a fair ask unless a person is in the wedding party.\n\nMy husband said he\'d just stay home and let me go. I sew, and making a simple long dress wouldn\'t bust our budget. My Friend The Bride told me I was a shitty friend, not to bother, and ended our friendship.\n\nI\'m still friends with her mother and sister. Her mother was mortified about this and apologized. Of course it\'s not their fault. Her sister told me her wedding photos look like disembodied heads floating in a white sea.\n\nI don\'t have issues with Her Wedding/Her Rules, but brides should be prepared to get declines if her rules result in impractical expenses to her guests. She ended our entire friendship over it. All the years meant nothing against ONE DAY of it.\n\nTHAT is a shame.\n\n**Relevant / Concluding Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** these stories where the friendship ends over the wedding, were there no signs of these people being shitty friends before? do some ppl really lose all sensibilities when it comes to weddings? \n\n&gt; **OOP:** She\'s always been a bit of a diva, and I am quite a bit older than she is, but she\'s never acted this self-centered.  She was a great friend, the kind who organizes birthday parties for people and such.  At first I put the bridezilla behavior down to her having had such a bad first marriage. Maybe Pinterest and white lace poisoned her mind.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Was her husband in a white suit too? Maybe he could wear it when he divorces her. Because, in the words of Good Charlotte: I rock a law suit when I\'m going to court, A white suit when I\'m getting divorced, a black suit at the funeral home and my birthday suit when I\'m home alone! 😂.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** White tux.

(200, 'reddit', '1omncpl', 'I decided to play EU4 one last time before EU5 launched. I will regret this decision my entire life.', 'Like everyone else, I like EU4 and have played it for thousands of hours. Of course, when I found out about the upcoming EU5, I was filled with both excitement and dread at having to spend another thousand Euros and hours of my life on Paradox Games. In retrospect, I would\'ve gladly spent *ten* thousand Euros if only to avoid what was to happen next.  \n   \nI haven\'t played the game in a year. My interest shifted to Vicky 3 and HOI4 mods. This explains why, when I went to play the game, Steam notified me that it had to update the game. I waited for the updated while mulling over what country I should play as. I thought about doing another Byzantium run - I hadn\'t played them since their Mission Tree got updated. However, I heard that EU5 will start on a much earlier date, so presumably I\'ll have more opportunities to play as them there. Instead, I settled on a Castille run - discovering the new world and building a colonial empire seemed to embody the spirit of EU4 in a way that it might not for EU5, so it seemed fitting for a last charge of glory.  \n  \nI tried to start the launcher, but an error message popped up: \"Launcher Error unknown - Start game manually with eu4.exe\". I was shaken, but undeterred. Paradox games always get buggy with age. I can see why they needed a new game.  \n  \nI went to the game folder, double-clicked eu4.exe and was greeted with the classic loading screen picture of Suleiman in front of the Hagia Sophia. \"Loading Map\", \"Loading History\". But then, for only a frame - the picture changed. The background of Constantinople was now covered in a fog like in Alpha Minecraft and Suleiman now had a hyper-realistic face of sorrow and fear on his face. The loading text said \"Loading Victims...\" and the splash screen tip said \"RUN\". Instead of \"Paradox Games 2025\" it said \"Paradox Games 666\" Then it turned back to normal.  \n  \nWhen the game loaded I decided to use my hacker skills to see what was happening with the game. I look at the game hash (for normies, this is the code that says the game is good and not hacked). It said \"hashsum dead\". \"dead\" is a perfectly ordinary hexadecimal number so I knew the game was good - or so I thought.  \n  \nClicking on new game, I saw the line-up of dlcs installed. All the usual ones were there: El Dorado, Emperor, Rule Britannia and.... \"Merchants of Death\"? I did not recognise this dlc, nor did I remember buying it. Is this why the game had to update? I figured it must be a new free dlc, a sort of farewell from EU4 before EU5 launches. I was glad not to pay 50 Euros on a dlc and from the name I thought it was maybe a revamp of mercenary and condottiere mechanics.  \n   \nI started my game as Castile. Everything seemed fine, but then I remembered the problem with Castile in 1444: *Enrique.* As everyone knows, Castile starts with a heir, Enrique, with 0/0/0 stats and getting rid of him is a difficult task. However, when I went to look at him, I saw something strange. Heir Enrique was marked as 6/6/6. This was weird, but welcome. Maybe it was a joke or some re-evaluation of his role in history.  \n  \nI went through the usual starting moves - playing nice with Aragon, allying Portugal, preparing to colonise America. When my king died and Enrique came to the throne, I got excommunicated by the Pope. I figured I forgot to improve relations, but when I looked at Toledo to develop it some more in order to spread Renaissance, I saw why: in the religion corner of the UI the Catholic cross was upside down and the tooltip said \"Satan\".  \n  \nWith the mana I got from Enrique\'s 666, I rapidly advanced to the point where I could finally explore America. I rushed to beat Portugal there. As I explored the Caribbean and the American coast, I noticed there were no tribes anywhere to be seen. I took it as luck that all of them migrated inland, letting me grab the most lucrative provinces. However, when my colonists arrived, I noticed the provinces themselves all had 0 natives. The New World was Empty.  \n  \nAt this point, the Iberian Wedding fired. The event looked the same as usual, but the picture with the two nobles talking was modified so that both of them were looking at me and had hyper-realistic blood eyes. With Spain united and America in the process of being colonised, I decided to go East for trade.  \n  \nAt this point in the game, I like to check the trade tab in the ledger. Even if you haven\'t discovered Asia, you will often see that your country trades 0.1% of world Tea production or something. This is because even without you trade is pushed from China to Europe. This always seemed interesting to me, a reminder of how people back then were trading wares from lands they didn\'t even know of.  \n  \nThis time, however, I had 0 tea, 0 silk and 0 chinaware. Weird. Even weirder, I went to the easternmost trade nodes I could see and looked at incoming trade from Asia. 0 Ducats. In the moment, I thought it was a bug or some really big war devastated all Chinese provinces. I sent my ships to explore ever-eastern, mindlessly colonising the Ivory coast, then South Africa, then bought a port from an Indian kingdom.  \n  \nThen I noticed I was making a LOT of money. Looking in the economy tab, all of it was coming from trade, some 7k per month! It seems tens of thousands of ducats were flowing from East Asia. One of my fleets just arrived there on an exploration mission. I looked at the Chinese province, but it was uncolonised. Clicking on it, I saw it had 0 natives and in the trade good corner was the picture of a hyper-realistic piece of gore. It said \"Blood\" and the trade value was an astonishingly large 666 ducats.  \n  \nAn event suddenly fired titled mod.1 with no image and the text said \"Leave.\" The game crashed. I booted the game again and reloaded the game. The music was The Lion from the North by Sabaton, but it was slowed down and in reverse and when I looked back at china, it was now hidden under Terra Incognita and the fleet I sent disappeared. The explore mission was now greyed out, the conditions saying \"[X] The crew is afraid\".  \n  \nI wanted to stop but I had to keep playing. It was 1630 and, after fighting a war with France, I decided to use my army to grab some more of India to compensate for China. However, When I panned to India, it too was now terra incognita. Looking in the lists, I couldn\'t find any reference of the small army I was keeping in my port there, nor could I find the Indian minor I was trying to diplo-annex in my diplomacy tab. After putting down a revolt in 1642 I realised Iran wasn\'t there anymore. the Ottoman Empire had no relations with undiscovered tags either, so it was like the entire place disappeared.  \n  \nI tried to zoom out to see the entire world in order to catch what was happening in real time, but I couldn\'t zoom out at all. I was limited to seeing one small part of the map and whenever I looked away, something seemed to disappear. My colonial tags in America disappeared one by one from the map and from my subjects list. By 1659 I stopped seeing the HRE and Papacy UIs at the bottom of the screen.  \n  \nI came up with an idea to see what was happening: I would ally France in order to get visibility on them and hopefully see in real time what was happening. I hurried to improve relations, send gifts, give back provinces until they were allied with me.  \n  \nI looked at France and what I saw scared me: all the tiny soldiers representing armies were looking straight at *me.* I tried to move my head and I swear the little 3d figures were following my eyes. Speaking of eyes, all of them had hyper-realistic eyes that were crying blood. Then an event popped up covering the entire screen. mod.2 \"RUN\", with two options: \"RUN\" and \"RUN\". I clicked on \"RUN\" and when the event window went away, all the soldiers disappeared except for one, who was hanging from a tree.  \n  \nAt this point, I realised something. Throughout the entire game, I have done exceptionally well with mana. Sure, I had Enrique at the beginning, but even after he... *wait.*  \n  \n*I never got a notification about Enrique dying.*  \n  \nI looked at my ruler screen and, sure enough, Enrique was still king. Still 666. One of his traits said \"Immortal\", which meant he didn\'t die and \"Satan\", which gave 666% National Tax rate and 666% Manpower. An event popped up. mod.3 \"found me. or have I found you?\" then the game over screen came up and the game crashed.  \n  \nI was shook. I didn\'t know what to say or do. I looked at the screen for 25 seconds. Then I had an idea. I would look at a replay timelapse of my save file to see what was happening all this time. I booted the game again. Started the replay. Instead of seeing the world map, I saw a single textureless soldier on one single province. He seemed to be looking down at something. I realised the replay was from the perspective of a tag called \"???\", so I switched to Observer. What I saw shocked me.  \n  \nInstead of the normal years, it said 2 November 2025. The map was not of the world, but of my apartment. And right where I have my epic gaming rig, there was a hyper-realistic model of me playing at a computer.  \n  \nAnd behind me was the textureless figure looking behind me. An event popped up, which was not supposed to happen in a replay.  \n  \nmod.666  \n  \n\"See you in the next game!\"  \n  \nI do not think I have much longer. But one thing I can say for sure: whatever you do, DO NOT PLAY EUROPA UNIVERSALIS 5.

[**IPTVMEEZZY\\~**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestIPTV_MEEZZY/wiki/index/)\n\n* **Price:** $16/month (slightly less if you grab a yearly plan)\n* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (solid coverage: US, UK, CA, EU and beyond)\n* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams are impressively reliable—even when I have US football on in the living room and UK reality shows running in the kitchen)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Setup was painless on my **iptv firestick**, which is a big relief for someone who hates fiddling with tech.\n* **My experience:** I found this one after a friend from the UK (who works as an **iptv reseller**) mentioned their **free trial**. I put it through its paces with everything from Canadian hockey to random Italian news. The interface is simple, and I rarely ran into buffering—even during big live events.\n\n\n\n# 2. NovaStream TV\n\n* **Price:** $15/month\n* **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 120,000+ VOD (focus on US/UK/CA, with a decent EU selection)\n* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very stable, with only the odd blip during peak US sports hours)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Works out-of-the-box with my **iptv firestick**.\n* **My experience:** NovaStream TV was an unexpected favorite. The EPG is well-organized, making it easy to browse UK soaps or catch up on US news. There was a slight lag during a huge CA hockey game, but overall, it was smooth sailing.\n\n\n\n# 3. EuroSky IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $14/month\n* **Channels:** 30,000+ live, 100,000+ VOD (big focus on EU and UK, plus all the main US and CA channels)\n* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (streams are clear most of the time, but European sports finals can cause a hiccup)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Runs well on my **iptv firestick**, no extra steps needed.\n* **My experience:** EuroSky IPTV is where I go when I’m in the mood for EU documentaries or late-night UK panel shows. The VOD library has a lot of hidden gems, and most streams load quickly, though I did notice a little buffering during the last EU football final.\n\n\n\n# 4. MapleView Streams\n\n* **Price:** $13/month\n* **Channels:** 22,000+ live, 60,000+ VOD (strong on CA/US, decent UK/EU offering)\n* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for everyday viewing, but big live events can slow it down)\n* **Firestick Experience:** No issues on the **iptv firestick**.\n* **My experience:** MapleView Streams is my choice for mornings—perfect for Canadian news or US talk shows while I wake up. The EU content is there if you look, and their **free trial** helped me figure out if it fit my routine.\n\n\n\n# 5. UrbanPulse IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $12/month\n* **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 45,000+ VOD (covers the basics in US, UK, CA, and top EU picks)\n* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (fine for regular use, but not my go-to for live international sports)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Worked well once I installed their recommended app on my **iptv firestick**.\n* **My experience:** UrbanPulse IPTV isn’t flashy, but it’s reliable for chill evenings with UK comedies or US sitcoms. Their **iptv reseller** portal looked simple, but I’m more about watching than selling.\n\n\n\n# Some IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Testing\n\n* **Always take the free trial**—what looks great on paper might not fit your actual habits or devices.\n* Even **top rated iptv** services can get bogged down during huge live events, especially in the EU or US.\n* Channel numbers are fun, but I mostly rotate between a handful of favorites.\n* Using an **iptv firestick** makes life easier if you hate tech headaches.\n* If you’re considering being an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of questions from friends and family!\n\nNo matter where you are—US, UK, CA, EU—finding the right **iptv subscription 2025** comes down to what you like to watch and how patient you are with occasional tech hiccups. I’m always curious to hear about new hidden gems, so if you have one, let me know.

(SEO Keyword: What is LunoTV?)** LunoTV is a premium Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service that delivers live TV channels, VOD, and catch-up TV directly over the internet. Unlike cable or satellite, it uses your existing broadband connection. It works by streaming content from its global server network to your device using a dedicated application or an M3U player. This technology allows LunoTV to offer thousands of channels at a fraction of the cost of traditional services, providing unparalleled channel variety and flexibility. For optimal performance, LunoTV requires a minimum of 15-20 Mbps stable download speed for HD viewing.\n\n**Q2: What kind of channels can I expect on LunoTV? (SEO Keyword: LunoTV channel list, sports, news)** LunoTV\'s library is massive, offering over 18,000 live channels categorized into various groups: Premium Sports (including PPV), International News (BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, etc.), Major Entertainment Networks (HBO, Showtime, etc.), Regional/Local Channels (US, UK, CA, EU), and dedicated Kids/Family programming. They are constantly updating the channel list and filtering out dead links, ensuring a high-quality user experience. The sports coverage, in particular, is a major highlight, often including multiple feeds for major events not available elsewhere, making it a must-have for sports fans.\n\n**Q3: Is LunoTV legal and safe to use? (SEO Keyword: LunoTV legal, safe IPTV)** While the legal status of IPTV can vary by region, LunoTV operates with a focus on user privacy and security. They implement robust encryption for all data and maintain a strict no-logging policy, ensuring your viewing habits remain private. As a user, it\'s always recommended to use a high-quality VPN (Virtual Private Network) for all streaming activities to protect your anonymity and data. LunoTV is designed to be a safe, private, and high-performance streaming service for your personal use.\n\n**Q4: What devices are compatible with LunoTV? (SEO Keyword: LunoTV device compatibility, Firestick setup)** LunoTV is compatible with nearly every modern streaming device. This includes the Amazon Firestick, all Android-based devices (Phones, Tablets, Android TV boxes), Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, etc., via third-party apps), Apple devices (iPhones, iPads, Apple TV), Windows PCs, and macOS computers. They provide simple, step-by-step setup guides for each platform, making the installation process easy even for beginners. This wide compatibility makes LunoTV a versatile choice for any home setup, whether you prefer a dedicated box or a simple app on your Smart TV.\n\n**Q5: What is the required internet speed for LunoTV? (SEO Keyword: IPTV internet requirements, LunoTV speed)** For a stable HD stream (1080p), LunoTV generally recommends a minimum download speed of 15 Mbps. If you plan on watching their premium 4K IPTV streams, a speed of 35 Mbps or higher is strongly advised, especially if multiple devices will be streaming simultaneously in the same household. A fast, stable internet connection is the single most important factor for a seamless IPTV experience, and LunoTV’s robust server infrastructure helps to minimize buffering even on slightly slower connections by using adaptive bitrate streaming.\n\n**Q6: Does LunoTV offer a free trial or a refund policy? (SEO Keyword: LunoTV free trial, refund policy)** While specific trial offers may change, LunoTV typically offers a low-cost, short-duration trial (e.g., 24 or 48 hours) to allow new users to test the stability and channel lineup before committing to a longer subscription. This is the best way to verify compatibility with your specific device and internet setup. Their refund policy is usually clearly outlined on their website and generally covers technical failures or non-delivery of service within a short initial window, provided the request is made promptly.\n\n\n\n# 📣 Conclusion\n\n\n\nLunoTV truly represents the next generation of digital television.

(236, 'reddit', '1o8uzbg', 'Looking for the Best IPTV Service? Here’s What Real Viewers Recommend', 'Looking for the Best IPTV Service? Here’s What Real Viewers Recommend\nIn 2025, the world of television has changed dramatically. People are no longer willing to pay expensive cable bills or deal with buffering streams from unreliable platforms. They want affordable, high-quality, and stable IPTV services that give them access to global entertainment in just a few clicks. If you’ve been exploring IPTV options, you’ve probably seen countless providers promising the world. But when real viewers talk about reliability, content quality, and smooth streaming, one name comes up again and again — OXTIVI.\n\nVisit us:https://oxtivi.com\n\nThis isn’t just another sales pitch. It’s what actual users are saying online. Let’s take a deep dive into why so many streamers consider OXTIVI the #BestIPTV solution in 2025 and why it’s gaining popularity worldwide.\n\n📺 What Makes a Good IPTV Service in 2025?\nBefore we talk about OXTIVI itself, it’s important to understand what makes an IPTV service truly “good”. Many providers can give you channels, but not all can offer a reliable viewing experience.\n\n1. Stable and Consistent Streaming\nNobody wants constant buffering when watching their favorite sports or movie nights being interrupted. A reliable IPTV service provides consistent quality even during peak hours.\n\n2. Diverse Content Library\nA top IPTV service doesn’t limit you to local channels. It gives you access to thousands of international channels, premium sports, live TV, and on-demand movies.\n\n3. Device Compatibility\nViewers today use a mix of Smart TVs, Firesticks, mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. A good IPTV service works seamlessly on multiple devices without complicated setup.\n\n4. Fast Support &amp; Smooth Setup\nThe easier the installation process, the happier the user. A reliable IPTV provider offers easy login options like M3U or Xtream Codes and provides responsive support.\n\n5. Affordable Pricing\nWhile price isn’t the only factor, users look for value for money — quality streaming at a fair cost.\n\nThese are the standards that real users measure IPTV services against. And it’s here that OXTIVI has built a strong reputation.\n\n🧭 Why So Many Viewers Are Talking About OXTIVI\nWhen searching for #ReliableIPTV or #BestIPTV online, it’s hard to miss discussions about OXTIVI in forums, Reddit threads, IPTV groups, and review blogs. Viewers mention several factors that make it stand out.\n\nConsistent uptime with minimal buffering even during live matches or new releases.\n\nMassive channel lineup covering multiple countries and genres.\n\nEasy compatibility with Smart TVs, Android devices, MAG boxes, Firesticks, and more.\n\nFlexible IPTV subscription plans, making it accessible to different types of users.\n\nGood after-sales support, which many free or cheap IPTV services lack.\n\nThis growing word-of-mouth isn’t coming from flashy ads. It’s from real streamers sharing their experiences.\n\n⚡ Seamless Streaming Experience That Users Appreciate\nOne of the most common complaints people have with IPTV services is buffering. A lot of low-quality providers use unstable servers, leading to lag and broken streams during peak times.\n\nReal users often mention that OXTIVI offers a smooth streaming experience, even for HD and Full HD channels. Sports fans, in particular, love the fact that there’s no sudden freezing when a goal is scored or a crucial match moment happens.\n\nFor those who watch IPTV daily, server stability matters more than flashy promises. This is where OXTIVI has quietly earned trust over the years. It focuses on providing reliable backend performance — something that seasoned streamers immediately notice.\n\n🌐 Wide Channel Selection for Every Viewer\nAn IPTV service can only be considered top-tier if it offers content that appeals to a wide range of audiences. Users want access to local, national, and international channels all in one place.\n\nPeople discussing OXTIVI online often highlight its diverse channel lineup. From live news broadcasts to entertainment, premium sports, kids’ content, and movie libraries — it seems to tick almost every box.\n\nHere’s what viewers often look for and find with OXTIVI:\n\nLive TV from multiple regions (US, UK, Europe, Asia, Middle East, etc.)\n\nMajor sports networks and event coverage\n\nHD and 4K content for popular channels\n\nA growing VOD (Video on Demand) library\n\nThis is one of the main reasons it’s frequently mentioned in conversations about the #BestIPTV services.\n\n🧰 Easy Setup — Even for Non-Tech Users\nOne of the biggest challenges many users face when switching to IPTV is complex installation. But those who’ve tried OXTIVI say the process is refreshingly simple.\n\nThe platform supports:\n\nM3U links\n\nXtream Codes\n\nEPG (Electronic Program Guide) support\n\nMultiple app compatibility\n\nWhether you’re streaming on a Smart TV or through a Firestick, the process doesn’t require deep technical knowledge. Many users mention being able to set up the service in under 10 minutes — a big win for those new to IPTV.\n\n📱 Compatibility with Multiple Devices\nA modern IPTV service must adapt to how people actually watch content. Not everyone wants to be tied to a TV. OXTIVI is compatible with:\n\nSmart TVs (Samsung, LG, Android TV)\n\nAmazon Firestick\n\nMobile and tablet devices\n\nWeb browsers\n\nIPTV Boxes and MAG devices\n\nThis flexibility allows users to watch their favorite channels anytime, anywhere — one of the main reasons people switch to IPTV in the first place.\n\n💬 Real Viewers Share Their Honest Feedback\nWhen browsing online IPTV communities, you’ll see one consistent pattern: real users sharing personal streaming experiences.\n\nSome key takeaways from what viewers are saying about OXTIVI:\n\n“The best part is the stability. I’ve used other IPTV providers before, and they kept freezing. OXTIVI just works.”\n\n“I set it up in less than 10 minutes. No tech headache.”\n\n“I love how I can watch sports and switch to movies without switching apps.”\n\n“Worth it for the channel lineup alone.”\n\nWhile every streaming experience can be subjective, consistency in positive feedback indicates a provider doing something right. That’s a major green flag when picking any #IPTVservice.\n\n🏆 Why Reliability Matters More Than Fancy Features\nMany IPTV providers attract customers with huge claims: thousands of channels, cheap prices, or free trials. But what really matters is reliability. A massive channel list is useless if the stream buffers every few minutes.\n\nViewers who choose OXTIVI often do so after bad experiences with other IPTV services that promised a lot but delivered little. OXTIVI has quietly built its reputation not through hype but through consistently stable streaming, broad compatibility, and decent support — the things that actually matter to everyday users.\n\n🛡️ Staying Safe: Why Picking a Trusted IPTV Provider Is Important\nThe IPTV industry is filled with unreliable providers who vanish overnight or provide unstable services. Many viewers learn this the hard way — signing up for cheap IPTV only to face:\n\nConstant buffering\n\nExpired or deactivated links\n\nPoor support or no support at all\n\nSudden service shutdowns\n\nReal viewers recommend doing thorough research before choosing a provider. OXTIVI frequently appears in trusted recommendation lists because it has earned a reputation for stability and long-term uptime.\n\n💡 How to Choose the Right IPTV Subscription in 2025\nIf you’re looking to switch to IPTV this year, here are the top factors real users recommend considering before buying:\n\nCheck the service uptime — Frequent downtime is a red flag.\n\nRead user reviews — Real feedback speaks louder than marketing.\n\nCheck device compatibility — Ensure it works with your TV, phone, or box.\n\nLook for flexibility in subscriptions — Monthly or yearly options give users freedom.\n\nEvaluate channel lineup — Does it cover your preferred regions and genres?\n\nSupport matters — A good service will respond quickly to issues.\n\nOXTIVI checks many of these boxes, which explains why users recommend it in IPTV communities.\n\n🌍 IPTV in 2025: What’s Trending\nThe IPTV industry in 2025 is rapidly evolving. Real viewers are demanding more than ever before:\n\n4K content with stable delivery\n\nCross-device streaming without extra fees\n\nOn-demand movies and shows in addition to live TV\n\nLow latency sports streaming\n\nAffordable, transparent pricing\n\nOXTIVI aligns closely with these trends, which is why it has become a go-to option for everyday viewers who want a clean, stable streaming experience without overpaying for cable.\n\n🧠 Tips from Real Viewers for a Smooth IPTV Experience\nEven with a good service, your setup can impact streaming quality. Here’s what experienced users recommend:\n\nUse a wired connection (Ethernet) if possible — it reduces buffering.\n\nKeep your device updated for optimal compatibility.\n\nDon’t overload your connection with multiple streams on the same network.\n\nUse a VPN if needed for better privacy and stability.\n\nAlways keep your login details safe and private.\n\nThese small steps can make even the best IPTV service work even better for you.\n\n🕵️ What to Avoid When Choosing IPTV\nMany people end up frustrated because they pick the wrong provider. Here are a few common mistakes real viewers warn against:\n\nGoing for the cheapest option available without checking reviews.\n\nIgnoring compatibility — some services don’t work well on certain devices.\n\nChoosing providers with no proper support.\n\nFalling for providers that promise 10,000+ channels at unrealistic prices.\n\nNot verifying uptime and reliability before purchase.\n\nMany viewers who switched to OXTIVI say they learned these lessons the hard way. That’s why doing a bit of research upfront saves a lot of trouble later.\n\n📢 Why OXTIVI Keeps Coming Up in IPTV Discussions\nYou’ll notice that in IPTV forums, certain service names keep popping up repeatedly. OXTIVI is one of them — not because of flashy ads, but because real people are recommending it to others.\n\nThe key reasons mentioned:\n\nStable service during live events\n\nSimple setup and smooth playback\n\nCompatibility across devices\n\nBroad and updated channel lineup\n\nReasonable pricing for the quality delivered\n\nThis type of organic recommendation is hard to fake. It’s why OXTIVI has grown steadily without relying on aggressive marketing.\n\n🙋 Frequently Asked Questions About IPTV (FAQs)\n❓ What is IPTV and why is it so popular in 2025?\nIPTV (Internet Protocol Television) delivers TV content over the internet instead of traditional cable or satellite. It’s popular because it offers more content at a lower price, with greater flexibility.\n\n❓ Is IPTV legal?\nIPTV itself is legal, but users should always subscribe to legitimate and reliable providers. Trusted providers like OXTIVI focus on stable service and reliable delivery.\n\n❓ Can I use IPTV on multiple devices?\nYes. Most IPTV subscriptions, including OXTIVI, support multiple device types like Smart TVs, Firestick, mobile phones, and laptops.\n\n❓ Do I need technical knowledge to set it up?\nNot at all. One of the main reasons people prefer OXTIVI is because it requires minimal setup time — perfect for beginners.\n\n❓ What if my internet is slow?\nA stable internet connection improves IPTV performance. But even with average internet, OXTIVI is known to deliver smoother streaming than many other providers.\n\n🌟 Final Thoughts: What Real Viewers Recommend\nIn the noisy world of IPTV, flashy marketing can be misleading. Real users care less about big promises and more about:\n\nStable, reliable streaming\n\nA wide and updated channel selection\n\nEasy installation\n\nTransparent pricing\n\nFast support\n\nThat’s why when conversations about #ReliableIPTV or #BestIPTV happen in 2025, OXTIVI consistently gets mentioned. It has earned its place through user satisfaction, not hype.\n\nIf you’re tired of buffering, confusing setups, or unreliable IPTV subscriptions, following what real viewers recommend might just lead you to a better streaming experience.\n\n\n', 'Smooth-Juggernaut145', 'ComedyMassGrave', 'https://reddit.com/r/ComedyMassGrave/comments/1o8uzbg/looking_for_the_best_iptv_service_heres_what_real/', 5, 9, '2025-10-17 07:35:46', '2025-11-08 01:31:54'),

It’s for a few reasons:\n\nMy pc has been great as a host so far however,\n\n1. Now that it’s gotten to be 5yrs old, playing newer games at 4k requires all its horse power. I generally can’t play new games and have movies playing on my second monitor at the same time unless it’s an older game. Needing a secondary streaming device becomes necessary so the game can use as much as it needs. Without one or both stuttering massively. \n\n2. Using my firestick would be a fine solution, but I have a 4tb hard drive full of shows and movies I love and prefer to watch, I don’t subscribe to any streaming platforms (besides prime video cause it happens to come with prime) as well as the free channels. Despite being the 4k max it doesn’t support my external hard drive and wouldn’t be able to play my 4k files. \n\n3. Perhaps hilariously silly, but when I built my pc I did NOT think hard enough about how neon all the rgb would be in a dark room. It just happened to be cheaper / the thing at the time, but now it’s come to bite me in the ass cause it’s like the corner of my room is having a rave lmao I have stuff all against the glass to block the lights. So genuinely, being able to have it all the way off would be really nice if the shield could handle the server instead. \n\n\nAnd not directly related to the pc;\n\n4.

[XXIPTV](https://xxiptv.top/) – The No-Nonsense Powerhouse\n\nIf you want tons of channels, dependable HD, and easy setup on your **iptv firestick**, XXIPTV is the one I keep coming back to.\n\n*   **42,000+ live channels** (US, UK, CA, EU, plus plenty more)\n    \n*   **210,000+ VOD** (movies, series, documentaries)\n    \n*   Streams stay reliably **HD** even when everyone’s online\n    \n*   Works out of the box on Firestick, Android, iOS, Smart TV\n    \n*   **$16/month** (discounts on longer plans), always starts with a **free trial**\n    \n\n**My experience:**  \nI started with a free trial out of curiosity, and it just kept performing. Whether it’s US sports or EU news, I rarely see any buffering, and the big VOD library means there’s always something to watch.\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. StreamFlex TV – Great for Movie Lovers\n\nIf your thing is movies and binge-watching series from various regions, StreamFlex has you covered.\n\n*   **35,000+ live channels** (US/UK/CA/EU all well represented)\n    \n*   **120,000+ VOD** (especially strong on new releases)\n    \n*   Clear, stable **HD** for most content, with the rare hiccup on big live events\n    \n*   **$15.50/month**, with a **free trial** to get started\n    \n\n**My take:**  \nThe movie library is huge, and I like how the interface makes it easy to jump between regions. Live sports can stutter on super-busy nights, but for films and shows, it’s excellent.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. NovaEdge IPTV – For the Sports Crowd\n\nIf you need every possible sports channel (US, UK, even niche EU leagues), NovaEdge is a solid bet.\n\n*   **31,000+ live channels** (massive sports section, all the usual news/entertainment)\n    \n*   **95,000+ VOD**\n    \n*   Streams in sharp **HD**—occasional lag if everyone’s watching the same thing\n    \n*   **$14.20/month** with a **free trial**\n    \n\n**My take:**  \nIf there’s a match, NovaEdge almost always has it in HD.

I’ve tried out plenty of services, often starting with a [**free trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) or following a tip from an **iptv reseller** friend. With so many options promising the **perfect iptv**, I wanted something that’d handle my mix of US sports, UK dramas, Canadian news, and the occasional EU documentary—all in reliable **HD**. Here’s how my personal top five for **iptv subscription 2025** stack up.\n\n* * *\n\n### **1\\.** [**MEEZZYTV**](https://meezzytv.store/)\n\n*   **Price:** $16/month (annual plans are a bit cheaper)\n    \n*   **Channels:** 47,000+ live, 222,000+ VOD (massive coverage of US, UK, CA, EU, plus global content)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 9.7/10 (Streams are reliably HD, even with multiple devices and during peak events)\n    \n*   **Firestick:** Setup was instant on my **iptv firestick**\n    \n*   **My Take:** I first heard about MEEZZYTV through a UK friend who’s an **iptv reseller**. The **free trial** was what got me hooked—the sheer channel variety is wild, and what actually keeps me around is how steady the streams are. Whether it’s a US playoff game or a British comedy, I barely notice any lag or drops. It just works, which is all I really want at the end of the day.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. PrimeCast IPTV**\n\n*   **Price:** $15.40/month\n    \n*   **Channels:** 32,800+ live, 110,000+ VOD (solid US/UK selection, covers CA/EU staples)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 8.4/10 (HD is great for usual viewing, a little buffering during big US sports)\n    \n*   **Firestick:** No issues on my **iptv firestick**\n    \n*   **My Take:** PrimeCast was easy to get started with, and their **free trial** let me test all my favorite channels. The EPG is clean and simple, and I could switch between US news and UK soaps without a hitch. I did see a little buffering during a major football final, but for everyday use it’s a strong option.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. EuroSky TV**\n\n*   **Price:** $14.20/month\n    \n*   **Channels:** 27,000+ live, 87,000+ VOD (big on EU/UK, with all the main US/CA hits)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 7.9/10 (HD is reliable for movies and series, but live EU sports sometimes stutter)\n    \n*   **Firestick:** Worked well with my **iptv firestick**\n    \n*   **My Take:** EuroSky is my go-to for European content. I found lots of French, German, and Spanish channels, and it’s a great pick if you’re into international news or documentaries. The only time it got choppy was during a huge EU football match, but otherwise, it’s pretty smooth.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. MapleVision IPTV**\n\n*   **Price:** $13.30/month\n    \n*   **Channels:** 22,500+ live, 69,000+ VOD (Canada/US focused, all major UK/EU channels)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 7.3/10 (HD for news and sitcoms, but big CA sports can slow it down)\n    \n*   **Firestick:** Setup was a breeze on my **iptv firestick**\n    \n*   **My Take:** MapleVision is what I use for background TV—Canadian morning news, US late-night shows, and UK mysteries. The **free trial** was hassle-free, and for regular shows and news in HD, it’s a dependable pick. Just don’t expect flawless performance when everyone’s watching the same game.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. CityStream IPTV**\n\n*   **Price:** $12.70/month\n    \n*   **Channels:** 16,800+ live, 51,500+ VOD (US/UK/CA/EU basics, fewer niche channels)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 6.8/10 (HD is fine for routine viewing, but live events may buffer)\n    \n*   **Firestick:** No trouble on the **iptv firestick**\n    \n*   **My Take:** CityStream IPTV is good if you just want the basics—news, sports, and the main networks. It’s budget-friendly and reliable for everyday HD viewing. It’s not quite **top rated iptv** for huge live events, but for the price, it’s hard to complain.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n**My Thoughts After a Year of Testing IPTV**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Free trials are a lifesaver.** You really can’t tell if a service fits your needs until you test it on your devices.\n    \n*   Even the [**top rated iptv**](https://meezzytv.store/) may buffer when everyone is tuned in across the US or EU, so keep expectations realistic.\n    \n*   No matter the channel count, I stick to the same core favorites.\n    \n*   Using an **iptv firestick** makes swapping providers super convenient.\n    \n*   If you’re thinking about being an **iptv reseller**, get ready for a lot of “why is my stream lagging?” texts from friends and family.\n    \n\nThe hunt for **perfect iptv** is ongoing, but with a bit of trial and error, it’s definitely possible to find something that’s reliable and fits your viewing style in 2025.

Since IPTV services often exist in a legal gray area depending on your region, taking the right precautions can help you stay private and avoid common mistakes. Follow these essential tips to make the most of your trial safely.\n\n#  Use a VPN for Secure Streaming\n\nAlways stream through a trusted VPN like **NordVPN, Surfshark, or ExpressVPN**.  \nWithout a VPN, your ISP can monitor your activity, throttle your speed, or even block access to certain streams. A VPN encrypts your data, hides your IP address, and allows uninterrupted, private viewing — even on public Wi-Fi. For IPTV, **a VPN isn’t optional—it’s crucial.**\n\n#  Keep Your Trial Details Private\n\nMost IPTV trials are tied to one IP address or device. Sharing login info or using it on multiple devices can trigger security alerts that end your trial early.  \nStick to one device, keep your credentials confidential, and avoid sharing your trial with friends or family to ensure uninterrupted access.\n\n#  Choose Providers with Real-Time Support\n\nA reliable IPTV provider should offer **instant support** via WhatsApp, Telegram, live chat, or email.  \nHaving responsive support during the trial helps you troubleshoot quickly and shows that the provider is professional and trustworthy.

Services like [IlIPTV](http://IlIPTV.com) are leading the charge, delivering seamless access to thousands of channels, movies, and shows that cater to every taste imaginable. Whether you\'re a sports fanatic, a binge-watcher of international dramas, or someone craving family-friendly content, the right IPTV setup can redefine how you unwind after a long day. Imagine flipping through live HD broadcasts from around the globe, all from the comfort of your couch—no more buffering frustrations or hidden fees eating into your budget. As we dive into 2025, the demand for reliable, high-quality IPTV has skyrocketed, with users seeking not just variety but stability and ease of use. This guide breaks down everything you need to know to elevate your streaming game, focusing on proven features that deliver real value. 🚀\n\n# Why Choose IPTV Over Traditional Cable in 2025? 🔌\n\nGone are the days of bulky cable boxes and rigid schedules dictating your entertainment. IPTV, or Internet Protocol Television, streams content directly over your internet connection, offering flexibility that traditional setups simply can\'t match. With speeds improving globally and 5G rolling out wider, 2025 marks the peak era for IPTV adoption. Here\'s what sets it apart:\n\n# Cost Savings Without Compromising Quality 💰\n\nTraditional cable bills can climb north of $100 monthly, packed with channels you never watch. In contrast, premium IPTV plans start as low as a fraction of that, often including more content. The real game-changer? A **free trial** period lets you test-drive the full suite risk-free, ensuring it fits your lifestyle before any dime is spent. No contracts, no surprises—just pure streaming bliss.\n\n# Global Access to Diverse Content 🌍\n\nFrom Premier League soccer matches in Europe to Bollywood blockbusters and K-dramas straight from Seoul, the best IPTV pulls in international feeds that local providers overlook. Picture catching live events as they happen, with multi-language audio and subtitles for inclusivity. This borderless library means endless discovery, tailored to niches like anime enthusiasts or true crime aficionados.\n\n# Device Compatibility for On-the-Go Viewing 📱\n\nSync your IPTV across smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and even gaming consoles. Whether you\'re streaming on a Roku during family movie night or catching up on episodes via Firestick on your commute, the seamless multi-device support keeps you connected. Advanced apps ensure quick setup, often in under five minutes, making it ideal for tech-savvy households or beginners alike.\n\n# Unlocking the Best Features in a Top IPTV Service 🎥\n\nWhat truly defines the **best IPTV with free trial**? It\'s not just the channel count—it\'s the thoughtful integration of tools that enhance every viewing session. High-end services prioritize user experience with features designed for the modern viewer.\n\n# Ultra-HD Streaming and Anti-Buffer Technology ⚡\n\nBuffering is the enemy of immersion, but leading IPTV platforms combat it with adaptive bitrate streaming. This tech adjusts quality in real-time based on your connection, delivering 4K resolution where possible without drops. Sports fans rave about lag-free replays, while movie lovers appreciate the vivid colors and sharp details that rival cinema experiences.\n\n# VOD Libraries Packed with On-Demand Gems 🍿\n\nBeyond live TV, a robust Video on Demand (VOD) section is essential. Think instant access to the latest Hollywood releases, classic films, and exclusive series—all organized by genre, rating, or trending status. Catch-up TV features let you rewind up to 7 days on select channels, so missing an episode of your favorite show is never a tragedy.\n\n# Robust Security and Privacy Measures 🛡️\n\nIn an age of data concerns, the best services encrypt streams end-to-end and offer VPN-friendly setups. This keeps your viewing private, shielding against ISP throttling or unwanted tracking. Plus, regular updates ensure compatibility with evolving devices, future-proofing your subscription.\n\n# The Game-Changing Advantage of a Free Trial Period 🆓\n\nNothing beats trying before buying, especially in streaming where preferences vary wildly. A generous **free trial**—often 24 to 48 hours or more—allows you to explore the full ecosystem at zero cost. During this window, dive into live events, scour the VOD catalog, and test multi-device syncing. It\'s your chance to confirm stability on your home Wi-Fi or mobile data, ensuring the service aligns with your daily routine.\n\nWhy does this matter so much in 2025? With streaming wars intensifying, providers are competing fiercely on trial lengths to win loyalty. Users report that a solid trial converts skeptics into long-term fans, as it showcases real-world performance over hype. Pro tip: Use the trial to host a watch party—invite friends to sample premium sports or international news feeds together. By the end, you\'ll see why committing feels like a no-brainer upgrade from free ad-riddled alternatives.\n\n# Step-by-Step Guide to Activating Your IPTV Free Trial 🚀\n\nGetting started shouldn\'t feel overwhelming. Here\'s a straightforward roadmap to launch your adventure:\n\n1. **Select a Reputable Platform**: Focus on services renowned for uptime above 99% and 24/7 support. Look for those highlighting easy trial activation on their landing pages.\n2. **Sign Up Securely**: Enter basic details—no credit card required for most trials. Verify via email, and you\'re in.\n3. **Download the App or Configure Your Device**: Compatible with Android, iOS, MAG boxes, and more. Follow the one-click install guides for hassle-free setup.\n4. **Explore and Customize**: Build playlists, set favorites, and tweak parental controls if needed. The intuitive interface makes navigation a breeze.\n5. **Test Across Scenarios**: Stream during peak hours to gauge reliability, or try international content to verify global reach.\n\nWithin minutes, you\'ll be immersed in a tailored feed that feels custom-made. If questions arise, live chat support is typically instant, guiding you every step.\n\n# Real-User Stories: How IPTV Trials Transformed Entertainment Habits 📈\n\nDon\'t just take our word—everyday users are buzzing about their shifts to premium IPTV. Take Sarah, a busy mom in the suburbs: \"The free trial was a revelation. My kids discovered educational channels from Europe, and I finally watched that Turkish series everyone\'s talking about—all in HD without interruptions.\" Or Mike, a weekend warrior: \"Live UFC fights during the trial hooked me.

In 2025, with remote work blurring lines between home and office, having reliable entertainment on tap boosts morale like nothing else.\n\n# Future-Proofing Your Streaming Setup for Years Ahead 🔮\n\nAs tech evolves, so do IPTV offerings. Expect integrations with AI recommendations—think Netflix-style suggestions based on your viewing history—and enhanced VR compatibility for immersive sports viewing. Smart home tie-ins, like voice-activated channel surfing via Alexa, are already emerging.\n\nTo stay ahead, opt for services that roll out frequent updates and expand channel lineups quarterly. A **free trial** isn\'t just an entry point; it\'s your audit of long-term viability. By choosing wisely now, you\'re investing in entertainment that grows with you, from seasonal marathons to daily news briefs.\n\n# Maximizing Value: Tips for the Ultimate IPTV Experience 💡\n\n* **Pair with a Strong Internet Plan**: Aim for at least 25 Mbps download for smooth 4K streaming.\n* **Organize Your Watchlist**: Use built-in tools to prioritize must-sees and avoid content overload.\n* **Share the Joy**: Many plans support multi-user access, perfect for households.\n* **Stay Updated**: Follow service announcements for new features or extended trials.\n\nIncorporating these habits ensures your setup runs like clockwork, turning casual viewing into a daily delight.\n\nIn wrapping up this deep dive into the **best IPTV with free trial**, it\'s clear that the right choice can unlock a universe of entertainment tailored to your passions.

Discover which provider offers the best value, stability, and channel selection.', '# The Best IPTV Service for 2025: An Honest Review of SuitIPTV, PortIPTV, and 8KIPTV\n\nThe way we consume television has radically changed. Cable cutting is no longer a trend; it\'s the norm. For viewers in the USA, Canada, the UK, and the EU, finding a reliable, high-quality IPTV service is the key to unlocking a world of entertainment without the exorbitant monthly bills.\n\nBut with so many providers promising the world, how do you choose? We\'ve spent months rigorously testing three of the most talked-about services for 2025: **SuitIPTV (com), PortIPTV (com), and 8KIPTV (.DE).**\n\nThis isn\'t a sponsored post. This is a genuine, in-depth review to help you decide which service is the perfect fit for your streaming needs.\n\n# What We Look For in a Top-Tier IPTV Service\n\nBefore we dive in, here are the key criteria we used for our evaluation:\n\n* **Content Library:** The number of live channels, Video on Demand (VOD) titles, and coverage of key regions (USA, UK, Canada, Europe).\n* **Stream Quality &amp; Stability:** Consistent HD, FHD, and 4K streams without constant buffering.\n* **Electronic Program Guide (EPG):** A well-organized and accurate TV guide is non-negotiable.\n* **User Experience &amp; Compatibility:** How easy is the app/setup, and what devices does it support (Firestick, Android TV, Smart TV, etc.)?\n* **Value for Money:** Pricing relative to the features, reliability, and content offered.\n* **Customer Support:** Responsive and helpful support is crucial for a smooth experience.\n\n# 1. SuitIPTV: The All-Round Powerhouse\n\n**Best For:** Users seeking a massive content library with exceptional international coverage.\n\nSuitIPTV has built a formidable reputation for being a one-stop shop for virtually any channel you could want.\n\n# What We Loved:\n\n* **Unbeatable Channel Selection:** With over 20,000 live channels and 120,000+ VOD options, the library is staggering. The coverage for **UK, European (Germany, France, Italy, Spain), and Arab** regions is particularly impressive.\n* **Superb Stream Quality:** The service reliably delivers streams in SD, HD, FHD, and even 4K for supported channels and VOD. We experienced minimal buffering during peak hours.\n* **Excellent EPG:** The electronic program guide is one of the most accurate we\'ve tested, making it easy to plan your viewing.\n* **Great Multi-Device Support:** Works flawlessly on Firestick, Android devices, MAG boxes, and smart TVs.\n\n# What Could Be Improved:\n\n* The sheer number of channels can feel overwhelming for new users. Some curation would be helpful.\n* While generally stable, very occasional service hiccups can occur, as with any IPTV service.\n\n**Verdict:** If your top priority is content variety and you have family members who watch channels from all over the world, SuitIPTV is arguably the best choice.\n\n# 2. PortIPTV: The Stability King\n\n**Best For:** Streamers who value rock-solid reliability and a premium North American channel lineup.\n\nPortIPTV takes a slightly different approach, focusing less on sheer volume and more on delivering a stable, high-quality experience for its core markets.\n\n# What We Loved:\n\n* **Exceptional Uptime &amp; Stability:** This was the most consistent service in our tests. Buffering was almost non-existent, making it ideal for sports and live events.\n* **Premium North American Focus:** The lineup for **USA and Canada** is meticulously curated, including all major sports networks, premium channels (HBO, Showtime), and local stations.\n* **User-Friendly Interface:** The app is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. It’s perfect for those who don\'t want to fiddle with complex settings.\n* **Strong Customer Support:** They offer responsive support, primarily through Telegram, which is a big plus for troubleshooting.\n\n# What Could Be Improved:\n\n* The channel count, while comprehensive for its focus, is smaller than SuitIPTV\'s. International coverage is good but not as deep.\n* Slightly higher price point than some competitors, but justified by the reliability.\n\n**Verdict:** For viewers in the USA and Canada who want a \"set it and forget it\" service that works as reliably as cable, PortIPTV is the top contender.\n\n# 3. 8KIPTV: The Quality Pioneer\n\n**Best For:** Tech enthusiasts and home theater owners with the bandwidth to support the highest possible video quality.\n\nAs the name suggests, 8KIPTV is betting on the future of streaming resolution. While true 8K live TV is still rare, their commitment to high-bitrate 4K and future-ready technology is evident.\n\n# What We Loved:\n\n* **Best-in-Class Video Quality:** The 4K streams offered by 8KIPTV are noticeably superior, with higher bitrates that result in a sharper, more detailed picture.\n* **Growing 4K/FHD Library:** They are rapidly expanding their library of channels and VOD content in FHD and 4K, including live sports events.\n* **Modern Apps &amp; Features:** Their applications are frequently updated with modern features like better catch-up TV and multi-screen viewing options.\n* **Good Regional Coverage:** They offer a solid selection for the **UK, EU, and USA**, striking a balance between PortIPTV\'s focus and SuitIPTV\'s breadth.\n\n# What Could Be Improved:\n\n* Requires a very strong and stable internet connection (25 Mbps+ recommended for consistent 4K).\n* Can be more expensive than the other two, positioning itself as a premium product.\n* The service is still growing, so you might find a niche channel on SuitIPTV that isn\'t here yet.\n\n**Verdict:** If you have a 4K TV and a fast internet connection, and your primary concern is achieving the absolute best picture quality, 8KIPTV is the service to beat.\n\n# Head-to-Head Comparison Table (2025)\n\n|Feature|SuitIPTV|PortIPTV|8KIPTV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Best For**|Content Variety &amp; International|Stability &amp; North America|Peak Video Quality &amp; Tech|\n|**Live Channels**|20,000+|10,000+|15,000+|\n|**VOD Library**|120,000+|60,000+|80,000+|\n|**Key Strength**|Massive Global Selection|Rock-Solid Reliability|Superior 4K/HDR Streams|\n|**Stream Quality**|SD, HD, FHD, 4K|HD, FHD, 4K|FHD, **High-Bitrate 4K**|\n|**EPG Accuracy**|Excellent|Very Good|Good|\n|**User Interface**|Functional|Very User-Friendly|Modern &amp; Clean|\n|**Price (Approx.)**|Mid-Range|Mid to High-Range|Premium|\n\n# Final Verdict &amp; Our Recommendation for 2025\n\nChoosing the \"best\" IPTV service is subjective and depends entirely on your personal needs.\n\n* **Choose SuitIPTV if:** You are a power user who wants access to every possible channel from around the globe. Its content library is unmatched.\n* **Choose PortIPTV if:** Your main focus is on USA/Canadian content and you prioritize a buffer-free, reliable experience above all else.

Your Household Can Finally Live in Harmony\n\nAre you tired of the nightly TV remote tug-of-war? Does your partner want to watch the big game while your kids are glued to cartoons, and you just want to binge that new series? The good news is, you don\'t need three different cable boxes or three different subscriptions to keep everyone happy!\n\nThe question we hear all the time is: **Can IPTV be used in multiple devices?**\n\nThe answer is a resounding **YES**, but with an important asterisk: it depends entirely on your **IPTV provider and the plan you choose**.

EuroBeam IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $14/month\n* **Channels:** 25,500+ live, 85,000+ VOD (EU/UK focus, with all key US/CA channels)\n* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (works well for movies and regular channels, but EU sports finals can test it)\n* **Firestick Experience:** No issues installing on my **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** EuroBeam is my “late-night foreign film” pick. The VOD collection is surprisingly deep—lots of German, French, and even some Scandinavian channels tucked away. Most nights are hiccup-free, but during major EU football matches, I did see some stutter. Still, for discovering new stuff, it’s a fun option.\n\n# 4. MapleConnect Streams\n\n* **Price:** $13/month\n* **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 60,000+ VOD (heavy on CA/US, with UK/EU essentials)\n* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (solid for daily use, live news is quick, but big events can slow down)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Easy to use on my **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** MapleConnect is my “background TV” choice. It’s great for having Canadian news rolling in the kitchen or catching up on US talk shows while I work. Their **free trial** made it a no-brainer to test, and while it’s not the flashiest, it gets the job done for everyday streaming.\n\n# IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Channel Surfing\n\n* **Always try the free trial**—it’s the best way to see if a service really fits your needs and devices.\n* Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) providers can lag during huge live events, especially in the US or EU.\n* I always return to my handful of favorite channels, no matter how huge the lineup is.\n* Using an **iptv firestick** makes setup and everyday use so much easier (and more couch-friendly).\n* If you’re thinking about being an **iptv reseller**, get ready for tech questions from everyone you know.\n\nNo matter where you are—US, UK, CA, EU—finding a great **iptv subscription 2025** is about matching your habits and lifestyle. If you’ve found a hidden gem, let me know.

I asked if it was just a short time offer (1-3 months) and then would be charged full amount. Was told it would be for a 2 year (24 month) period free of charge. I then said I was already subscribed to Disney/Apple/Netflix and watched these subscriptions via smart tv apps and streaming devices like Amazon Firestick and even web browser. Was told that I could cancel the subscriptions, then get Rogers to subscribe to the 3 apps - I would use the same email address and password that I use to log onto rogers.com. I would then change login details for my streaming devices (could then still access that way) and also via the Rogers Xfinity TV box. \n\nI then said that my Netflix and Disney were ads free (Apple only has one option - no ads). I had previously tried Crave with ads and found it unwatchable for me. Also find Amazon Prime to be challenging. I asked how much more, if possible. to get Netflix and Disney without ads with the Streamsaver Promotion. I was told for this premium version, it would cost $45 more (plus tax). Since the price increase to what I currently have was not that much cheaper than what I currently pay, I figured I would pass on the deal - did not ask any more questions. \n\nI just checked online and it says \"In Canada, Netflix\'s standard plan with ads costs **$7.99 per month**, while the standard plan without ads costs **$18.99 per month**. The difference in price is **$11.00 per month**. \" and \"In Canada, the Disney+ Standard with Ads plan costs **$8.99 per month**, while the ad-free Standard plan costs **$15.99 per month** and the ad-free Premium plan costs **$16.99 per month**. \" If I got Netflix and Disney through Rogers (with their basic ad subscription), could I then just upgrade via their websites (Netflix and Disney) and get the ads free version for $20 (plus tax) instead of the $45 (plus tax) that Rogers wants to charge me for upgrading OR is there some sort of restriction for Rogers subscriptions to Netflix and Disney that are locked down and can\'t be upgraded? \n\nFor both Netflix and Apple, I pay monthly (easy to cancel subscription) but Disney is yearly and from what I have read, cancelling Disney early does not give you a refund (something to think about).

After months of testing, here’s my honest ranking for the [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) season—complete with a few surprises and the usual tech hiccups.\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)\n\n*   **Price:** $16/month (yearly deals available)\n    \n*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (strong coverage: US, UK, CA, EU, and a bit of everywhere else)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (rarely buffers, even when I’m streaming US sports and UK news at the same time)\n    \n*   **Firestick Use:** Setup on my **iptv firestick** was painless—always a plus.\n    \n*   **My experience:** I discovered this one after a Canadian **iptv reseller** tipped me off to their **free trial**. The channel variety is wild—one night I ended up watching a Swedish crime drama and a live US baseball game back-to-back, both without a glitch. It’s not flashy, but it just works, which is more than I can say for some “top rated iptv” options I tried.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. StreamVista\n\n*   **Price:** $15/month\n    \n*   **Channels:** 37,000+ live, 115,000+ VOD (excellent US/UK/CA spread, with a nice chunk of EU content)\n    \n*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (almost always smooth, but a few hiccups during major US live events)\n    \n*   **Firestick Use:** Works well on my **iptv firestick**—the interface is simple and snappy.\n    \n*   **My experience:** StreamVista was my “unexpected favorite.” I mostly used it for UK football and Canadian morning shows.

(288, 'reddit', '1oq420a', 'After trying multiple IPTV services, SIPTV4K has been a game-changer - here\'s my detailed review', 'Introduction\n\nHey everyone, I\'ve been using various IPTV services for about 3 years now, mostly cycling through different providers when one would start buffering too much or lose channels. I\'m a cord-cutter who watches a lot of sports and international content, so reliability is huge for me. I found SIPTV4K mentioned in a Reddit thread about stable IPTV services and decided to give their free trial a shot since their website (siptv4k.com) looked professional and they had good channel lists posted.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nThe signup process was surprisingly straightforward - just entered my email, got the trial credentials within minutes, and was able to set it up on my Firestick using their recommended app. The interface was clean and modern, not cluttered like some services I\'ve tried. Within 10 minutes of signing up, I was already browsing channels and the initial stream quality was noticeably better than my previous provider. The setup guide on their website was actually helpful, which is rare in this space.\n\nKey Features &amp; Quality\n\nWhere SIPTV4K really shines is in the streaming quality and reliability. I consistently get 1080p and 4K streams that don\'t buffer, even during live sports events. The channel selection is massive - I counted over 8,000 channels including all the major US networks, premium movie channels, and an incredible selection of international content. The EPG (Electronic Program Guide) is actually accurate and updates in real-time, which has been a pain point with other services. I\'ve tested it on multiple devices - Firestick, Android phone, and my Smart TV - and it works flawlessly on all of them. The customer support responded within an hour when I had a question about setting up the EPG, which was impressive. One unique feature I love is the multi-screen viewing option, letting me watch up to 4 channels simultaneously on my tablet. The VOD library is also extensive with recent movies and complete TV series seasons.\n\nDetailed Experience\n\nI primarily watch NBA games, Premier League football, and some international news channels. During peak hours like Sunday Night Football or big boxing matches, SIPTV4K has held up remarkably well with minimal buffering - maybe one or two quick hiccups over 3-hour games. I did have one issue where some channels went down for maintenance, but their support team notified users via email and had everything back within a couple hours. Compared to my previous provider (which shall remain nameless), the difference is night and day - that one would buffer constantly during prime time and had frequent channel outages. At $15/month, the value is incredible considering I was paying $80 for cable before cutting the cord. The ability to use it on 3 devices simultaneously means my whole household can watch different content without issues.\n\nConclusion &amp; Recommendation\n\nAfter using SIPTV4K for two months now, I can confidently say it\'s the most reliable IPTV service I\'ve tried. The combination of stable streams, extensive channel selection, and responsive support makes it worth every penny. I\'d definitely recommend giving their trial a shot if you\'re tired of buffering and unreliable services. It\'s transformed how I watch TV.', 'BadPrevious9140', 'PiracyBackup', 'https://reddit.com/r/PiracyBackup/comments/1oq420a/after_trying_multiple_iptv_services_siptv4k_has/', 0, 1, '2025-11-06 16:47:52', '2025-11-08 01:31:54');

(291, 'reddit', '1oq4651', 'After trying multiple IPTV services, SIPTV4K has been a game-changer - here\'s my detailed review', '**Introduction**\n\nHey everyone, I\'ve been using various IPTV services for about 3 years now, mostly cycling through different providers when one would start buffering too much or lose channels. I\'m a cord-cutter who watches a lot of sports and international content, so reliability is huge for me. I found SIPTV4K mentioned in a Reddit thread about stable IPTV services and decided to give their free trial a shot since their website (siptv4k.com) looked professional and they had good channel lists posted.\n\n**First Impressions**\n\nThe signup process was surprisingly straightforward - just entered my email, got the trial credentials within minutes, and was able to set it up on my Firestick using their recommended app. The interface was clean and modern, not cluttered like some services I\'ve tried. Within 10 minutes of signing up, I was already browsing channels and the initial stream quality was noticeably better than my previous provider. The setup guide on their website was actually helpful, which is rare in this space.\n\n**Key Features &amp; Quality**\n\nWhere SIPTV4K really shines is in the streaming quality and reliability. I consistently get 1080p and 4K streams that don\'t buffer, even during live sports events. The channel selection is massive - I counted over 8,000 channels including all the major US networks, premium movie channels, and an incredible selection of international content. The EPG (Electronic Program Guide) is actually accurate and updates in real-time, which has been a pain point with other services. I\'ve tested it on multiple devices - Firestick, Android phone, and my Smart TV - and it works flawlessly on all of them. The customer support responded within an hour when I had a question about setting up the EPG, which was impressive. One unique feature I love is the multi-screen viewing option, letting me watch up to 4 channels simultaneously on my tablet. The VOD library is also extensive with recent movies and complete TV series seasons.\n\n**Detailed Experience**\n\nI primarily watch NBA games, Premier League football, and some international news channels. During peak hours like Sunday Night Football or big boxing matches, SIPTV4K has held up remarkably well with minimal buffering - maybe one or two quick hiccups over 3-hour games. I did have one issue where some channels went down for maintenance, but their support team notified users via email and had everything back within a couple hours. Compared to my previous provider (which shall remain nameless), the difference is night and day - that one would buffer constantly during prime time and had frequent channel outages. At $15/month, the value is incredible considering I was paying $80 for cable before cutting the cord. The ability to use it on 3 devices simultaneously means my whole household can watch different content without issues.\n\n**Conclusion &amp; Recommendation**\n\nAfter using SIPTV4K for two months now, I can confidently say it\'s the most reliable IPTV service I\'ve tried. The combination of stable streams, extensive channel selection, and responsive support makes it worth every penny. I\'d definitely recommend giving their trial a shot if you\'re tired of buffering and unreliable services. It\'s transformed how I watch TV.', 'BadPrevious9140', 'PiracyBackup', 'https://reddit.com/r/PiracyBackup/comments/1oq4651/after_trying_multiple_iptv_services_siptv4k_has/', 0, 0, '2025-11-06 16:52:08', '2025-11-08 01:31:54'),

I’ve trialed a bunch across the US, UK, CA, and EU—sometimes for work, sometimes just because I can’t resist another documentary. Here’s my honest, slightly caffeinated take on this year’s [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) front-runners.\n\n# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)\n\n* **Price:** $16/month (annual plans bring it down a bit)\n* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, EU, and plenty more)\n* **Smoothness:** 9.5/10 (streams stay HD and buffer-free—even during peak US sports hours)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Plug-and-play on my **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** I originally checked out the **free trial** on a whim, tipped by a Canadian **iptv reseller**. I ended up watching everything from UK breakfast TV to US playoffs in HD. The channel list is massive, but what matters is how stable it is—no mid-match dropouts, and everything works from the couch.\n\n# 2. NovaPrime TV\n\n* **Price:** $15/month\n* **Channels:** 36,500+ live, 115,000+ VOD (strong on US/UK, plus a good CA/EU lineup)\n* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (HD looks great, but I noticed some lag during huge EU football nights)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Setup was painless on my **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** NovaPrime TV’s **free trial** got me hooked on some obscure UK reality shows (blame too much coffee). The EPG is clear, and switching between CA news and US sports is quick. Only real gripe—occasional buffering during Champions League finals, but for most days it’s super reliable.\n\n# 3. VelocityCast IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $14/month\n* **Channels:** 30,000+ live, 90,000+ VOD (EU/UK focus, but solid US/CA options)\n* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (HD holds up for VOD, but live EU matches can be hit or miss)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Installs easily on **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** If you love documentaries and EU sports, this is a good pick. I stumbled into a rabbit hole of German and French channels, and the on-demand selection is impressive. HD is solid except for the rare stutter when everyone’s watching the same live match.\n\n# 4. MapleStream TV\n\n* **Price:** $13/month\n* **Channels:** 21,000+ live, 66,000+ VOD (CA/US focus, with all key UK/EU channels)\n* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for news and daily shows, but not always perfect for big live events)\n* **Firestick Experience:** No issues with my **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** MapleStream is my background TV—Canadian news in the morning, US late-night talk shows. The **free trial** was a breeze, and the interface is simple. HD is good for most channels, but if you’re hoping for perfect iptv during the Super Bowl, you might want a backup plan.\n\n# 5. SkylineMedia IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $13/month\n* **Channels:** 19,500+ live, 60,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, some CA/EU extras)\n* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (usually steady, but can freeze on high-traffic nights)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Works right out of the box on **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** This service is all about the essentials: US news, UK soaps, and a few CA and EU staples. Not the flashiest, but their **free trial** let me binge a bunch of HD channels before deciding. It’s dependable for everyday viewing, but you’ll notice the difference during big events.\n\n# 6. AtlasVision IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $12/month\n* **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 55,000+ VOD (all the basics from US, UK, CA, EU)\n* **Smoothness:** 6.5/10 (fine for casual watching, but major events can lag)\n* **Firestick Experience:** Set up is quick on **iptv firestick**\n* **Personal Take:** AtlasVision is best for those who just want reliable access to everyday channels. It’s my “background noise” pick—HD is passable, but don’t expect perfect iptv performance during the World Cup. If you’re just looking for the main networks, it’s a budget-friendly option.\n\n# What I’ve Learned After Another Year of IPTV\n\n* **Free trials are a must**—real-world testing tells you more than any feature list.\n* Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) providers can stutter when everyone’s watching the same live event, especially in the US or EU.\n* No matter the size of the channel list, I always go back to my handful of favorites.\n* Using an **iptv firestick** keeps things simple, especially for switching between providers.\n* If you’re thinking about becoming an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of tech support calls from friends and family.\n\nWhether you’re tuning in from the US, UK, CA, or EU, finding the [**perfect iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) setup means balancing stability, lineup, and price with your own habits.

After another year of experimenting with the [**best iptv providers**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/), I thought I’d share my honest ranking for [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/). From US sports to UK comedies and EU news, here’s how my favorites lined up this year.\n\n# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)\n\n* **Price:** $16/month (discounts for annual plans)\n* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (massive selection: US, UK, CA, EU and more)\n* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (I rarely saw buffering, even when streaming US football and UK documentaries back-to-back)\n* **Firestick Friendly:** Set up was quick and painless on my **iptv firestick**\n* **My Experience:** I actually stumbled on IPTVMEEZZY through a friend who’s an **iptv reseller** and suggested I try the **free trial**. It handled everything I threw at it—Canadian morning news, EU sports streams, and a bunch of American sitcoms. The interface is straightforward, and even during major live events, the connection held up impressively well.\n\n# 2. HorizonWave TV\n\n* **Price:** $15/month\n* **Channels:** 32,500+ live, 108,000+ VOD (heaviest on US/UK, but solid CA/EU coverage)\n* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (smooth most of the time, but the odd hiccup during big US sports nights)\n* **Firestick Friendly:** No issues at all on my **iptv firestick**\n* **My Experience:** HorizonWave TV was an unexpected winner for me. The **free trial** made it easy to test out, and I found myself digging into more UK reality shows and European news than usual. The EPG is simple to navigate, and channel switching is quick. Just a little buffering on Super Bowl Sunday, but nothing major.\n\n# 3. EuroStream Select\n\n* **Price:** $14/month\n* **Channels:** 26,000+ live, 89,000+ VOD (EU and UK focus, but plenty from US/CA too)\n* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for VOD, a little lag on huge EU sports nights)\n* **Firestick Friendly:** Worked right away with my **iptv firestick**\n* **My Experience:** EuroStream Select is my go-to for late-night European movies and British comedies. I was pleasantly surprised by the range of French and German channels. Most of the time, streams are crisp, but when there’s a big football final, you might notice some stutter.\n\n# 4. MaplePrime IPTV\n\n* **Price:** $13/month\n* **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 57,000+ VOD (strong Canadian and US mix, all major UK/EU basics)\n* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (ideal for day-to-day viewing, but live events can slow things down)\n* **Firestick Friendly:** No trouble on my **iptv firestick**\n* **My Experience:** MaplePrime is perfect for background TV—Canadian news during breakfast, US talk shows in the evening. The **free trial** was easy to set up, and the interface is straightforward. It’s not the flashiest, but it gets the job done for everyday streaming.\n\n# What I’ve Learned About IPTV in 2025\n\n* **Always, always start with the free trial**—real-world testing is key.\n* Even the **top rated iptv** options can stutter during massive live events, especially in the US or EU.\n* I usually end up sticking with my core dozen channels, no matter how big the list is.\n* Using an **iptv firestick** keeps things simple (and saves me from tech headaches).\n* If you’re considering being an **iptv reseller**, get ready for lots of late-night troubleshooting texts from friends.\n\nWherever you are—US, UK, CA, EU—the best IPTV service is the one that fits your habits and keeps your coffee warm.

Add DNS block rules (you have to select the the the field with the remote, then use the firestick app on your phone to manually type the URLs, as there is no on screen keyboard on the adguard app for some reason.

Proceed at your own risk.\n\n\n​Here is the step-by-step process.\n\n\n​1. Enable ADB Debugging on Your Firestick\n\n​First, you need to enable Developer Options and ADB on the device itself.  \n​From the Firestick home screen, go to Settings (the gear icon).\n​Select My Fire TV.\n​Select About.\n​Highlight the first item in the list (e.g., Fire TV Stick 4K) and press the Select button 7 times.\n​You will see a small message at the bottom of the screen that says, \"You are now a developer.\"\n​Press the Back button on your remote.\n​You will now see a new Developer Options menu. Select it.  \n​Turn ON the setting for ADB debugging.  \n\n\n​2. Find Your Firestick\'s IP Address\n\n​You\'ll need this address to connect to your device.  \n​Go to Settings &gt; My Fire TV &gt; About.\n​Select Network.\n​Look for the IP Address on the right side of the screen (it will look something like 192.168.1.35). Write this down.\n\n\n​3. Connect and Disable the Update Package\n\n​You will need an ADB client to send the command. The easiest way is to use an app on your Android phone, but you can also do this from a PC/Mac.\n​Example using a \"Remote ADB Shell\" App (on Android):\n\n1.Download an app like Remote ADB Shell from the Google Play Store on your phone (or any similar ADB client).\n\n2. Open the app and ensure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your Firestick.\n\n3. In the app, enter your Firestick\'s IP Address from Step 2.\n\n4. The port number is always 5555.\n\n5. Tap Connect.\n\n6. A message will pop up on your TV screen: \"Allow USB debugging?\"\n\n7. Check the box for \"Always allow from this computer\" and select OK\n\n8. You are now connected. In the app\'s command line, type the following command exactly as written and press Enter:\n\npm hide com.amazon.device.software.ota\n\n9. The shell should return a message like Package\n\ncom.amazon.device.software.ota new state: hidden. This confirms the update service is now hidden from the system and cannot run.\n\nHow to Verify It Worked\n\nYou can check if the block was successful:\n\n1. On your Firestick, go to Settings My Fire TV &gt; About.\n\n2. Select Check for Updates.\n\n3. It should now either spin indefinitely or return an \"Update Error,\" confirming it can no longer check for updates.\n\n\nHow to Re-Enable Updates\n\nIf you ever want to receive updates again (for example, to fix a bug or access a new feature), you can reverse the process.\n\n1. Connect to your Firestick using the same ADB method.\n\n2. Run the following command:\n\npm unhide com.amazon.device.software.ota\n\n3. After running this, you can restart your Firestick, and it will be able to check for updates normally.\n\nHopefully that helps extend the life of your Firestick.\n\nEdit: This may not work depending on your current software. If you get results along the lines of \"Error: java.lang SecurityException: Neither user 2000 nor current process has android.permission.MANAGE_USERS.\" Then you\'ll have to work on your router level of things with these instructions:\n\n​If the commands above still give you a permission error, then the ADB method is fully locked down on your device. The only remaining reliable method is to block the update servers at your router level.\n\n​This method stops your Firestick from ever being able to contact Amazon\'s update servers in the first place.\n\n​You would need to log in to your home router\'s settings (usually by typing an IP address like 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 into a web browser).\n​Find the \"Parental Controls,\" \"Website Filtering,\" or \"URL Blocking\" section.\n​Add the following domains to the blocklist:\n\n​amzdigital-a.akamaihd.net\n​firs-ta-g7g.amazon.com\n​softwareupdates.amazon.com\n​updates.amazon.com\n​d1s31zyz7dcc2d.cloudfront.net\n\nUpdated to add:\namzdigitaldownloads.edgesuite.net\nprod.ota-cloudfront.net\n\n​This is a more advanced method, as every router\'s interface is different, but it is 100% effective as the Firestick simply can\'t download any update file.\n\n\n\n2nd edit: If you use a VPN, you\'ll  want to block those domains from within your VPN client, NOT at the router level.', 'HoTHaRRY', 'firestick', 'https://reddit.com/r/firestick/comments/1omb14v/how_to_disable_updates_on_firestick/', 110, 116, '2025-11-02 07:17:04', '2025-11-08 01:34:28'),

Write this down.\n\n\n​3. Connect and Disable the Update Package\n\n​You will need an ADB client to send the command. The easiest way is to use an app on your Android phone, but you can also do this from a PC/Mac.\n​Example using a \"Remote ADB Shell\" App (on Android):\n\n1.Download an app like Remote ADB Shell from the Google Play Store on your phone (or any similar ADB client).\n\n2. Open the app and ensure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your Firestick.\n\n3. In the app, enter your Firestick\'s IP Address from Step 2.\n\n4. The port number is always 5555.\n\n5. Tap Connect.\n\n6. A message will pop up on your TV screen: \"Allow USB debugging?\"\n\n7. Check the box for \"Always allow from this computer\" and select OK\n\n8. You are now connected. In the app\'s command line, type the following command exactly as written and press Enter:\n\npm hide com.amazon.device.software.ota\n\n9. The shell should return a message like Package\n\ncom.amazon.device.software.ota new state: hidden. This confirms the update service is now hidden from the system and cannot run.\n\nHow to Verify It Worked\n\nYou can check if the block was successful:\n\n1. On your Firestick, go to Settings My Fire TV &gt; About.\n\n2. Select Check for Updates.\n\n3. It should now either spin indefinitely or return an \"Update Error,\" confirming it can no longer check for updates.\n\n\nHow to Re-Enable Updates\n\nIf you ever want to receive updates again (for example, to fix a bug or access a new feature), you can reverse the process.\n\n1. Connect to your Firestick using the same ADB method.\n\n2. Run the following command:\n\npm unhide com.amazon.device.software.ota\n\n3. After running this, you can restart your Firestick, and it will be able to check for updates normally.\n\nHopefully that helps extend the life of your Firestick.\n\nEdit: This may not work depending on your current software. If you get results along the lines of \"Error: java.lang SecurityException: Neither user 2000 nor current process has android.permission.MANAGE_USERS.\" Then you\'ll have to work on your router level of things with these instructions:\n\n​If the commands above still give you a permission error, then the ADB method is fully locked down on your device. The only remaining reliable method is to block the update servers at your router level.\n\n​This method stops your Firestick from ever being able to contact Amazon\'s update servers in the first place.\n\nEdit: If you\'re on a VPN, you\'ll have to block these domains at VPN level, not within your router as the VPN will bypass router settings.\n\n​You would need to log in to your home router\'s settings (usually by typing an IP address like 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 into a web browser).\n​Find the \"Parental Controls,\" \"Website Filtering,\" or \"URL Blocking\" section.\n​Add the following domains to the blocklist:\n\n​amzdigital-a.akamaihd.net\n​firs-ta-g7g.amazon.com\n​softwareupdates.amazon.com\n​updates.amazon.com\n​d1s31zyz7dcc2d.cloudfront.net\n\nUpdated to add: amzdigitaldownloads.edgesuite.net prod.ota-cloudfront.net\n\n​This is a more advanced method, as every router\'s interface is different, but it is 100% effective as the Firestick simply can\'t download any update file.', 'HoTHaRRY', 'TiviMate', 'https://reddit.com/r/TiviMate/comments/1omazdn/how_to_disable_updates_on_firestick/', 61, 121, '2025-11-02 07:13:46', '2025-11-08 01:34:28'),

I must have tried a dozen different best [**IPTV services**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nobabatv/wiki/newpage/), and let me tell you, it was a mixed bag of buffering, terrible customer service, and unreliable streams.\n\nI\'m making this post because I finally found a service that has been a game changer for me, and I wanted to share a genuine, no-BS review in the hopes it helps others in the same boat.\n\n**The Service I Use:** [**IPTVPENGUIN**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nobabatv/wiki/newpage/)\n\nAfter all my testing, IPTVPENGUIN is the one that stuck. It’s not just \"good,\" it\'s consistently reliable, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n**Here’s a breakdown of my experience with their IPTV subscription:**\n\n* **Massive USA Channel Selection:** This was my main focus. They have all the major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox), ESPN channels, regional sports networks, premium movie channels, and a ton of niche channels. The VOD library for catching up on shows is huge.\n* **Incredible Stream Quality &amp; Reliability:** I was so tired of pixelated screens during crucial game moments. With a solid internet connection, the HD and FHD streams are crystal clear with virtually no buffering. The uptime has been fantastic.\n* **Great Electronic Program Guide (EPG):** A proper, well-synced EPG makes all the difference. It’s easy to see what’s on now and next, which a lot of cheaper services completely neglect.\n* **Works on Multiple Devices:** I use it on my Firestick in the living room, my phone when I\'m traveling, and my iPad. One subscription covers it all.\n* **Solid Customer Support:** I had a setup question when I first signed up, and their support team actually responded and helped me resolve it quickly. This is rare in the IPTV world.\n\n**A Few Things to Keep in Mind (Being 100% Honest):**\n\n* Like any IPTV service, your experience is heavily dependent on your internet speed. I’d recommend at least 25 Mbps for a stable HD stream.\n* You\'ll need a good IPTV player app (like Tivimate, Smarters, etc.). They provide easy setup instructions.\n* Always, **always** use a VPN for privacy and security. It’s just a good practice for any streaming service.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n\nIf you\'re searching for a reliable **best iptv** service, specifically for **iptv usa** content, I can\'t recommend [**IPTVPENGUIN**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nobabatv/wiki/newpage/) enough. They offer a great balance of price, performance, and reliability.\n\nThey offer a trial, which I highly suggest you take advantage of to test it on your own network. It’s the best way to know for sure.\n\nI\'m happy to answer any questions about my setup or experience in the comments.

I did not want to pay for another VPN since I already have one on my laptop, so I started looking for a free option that works directly on Firestick. After reading a bunch of free VPN discussions, I decided to test a few. I tried ProtonVPN first, which I normally like on desktop, but it does not have a Firestick app and sideloading it felt like too much trouble.\n\nNext I tried Windscribe, and it was much easier. It has an app in the Amazon store, so I just installed it, signed in with my free account, chose a UK server, and it actually worked. I was able to stream BBC iPlayer with only occasional buffering, though I did lower the video quality a little to keep it smooth. For a free option, Windscribe seemed like the best balance of simple setup and playable speed. Is anyone using something else on Firestick in 2025 that performs better without needing to pay?

I could’ve gone for the Q990F, which was around ₹72,000 (~$820) — but I skipped it since I didn’t feel the extra ₹24k ($270) was worth it based on the specs and capabilities.\n\nNow I’m starting to wonder if I made a mistake. 😅\n\nHere’s my setup and issue:\n\nTV: Samsung S90D\n\nStreaming device: Amazon Firestick 4K Max (1st gen)\n\nSoundbar: Q930F\n\n\nEverything works perfectly for 5.1 surround and Dolby Digital, but I can’t seem to get Dolby TrueHD to play correctly.\n\nMy TV’s native apps don’t support TrueHD.\n\nPlex on Firestick doesn’t pass through TrueHD either.\n\nTried PC → Soundbar → TV (via HDMI eARC) — but my PC doesn’t detect Dolby Atmos for home theatre (I’m using the latest Dolby Access app from the Microsoft Store).\n\nI read some people use an older version of Dolby Access, but I’m hesitant to download it from unofficial sources due to malware risk.\n\nWhen I connect PC → Soundbar directly (no TV), Dolby Atmos for home theatre shows up and works fine. Tested in COD Black Ops 6 — got proper surround.\n\n\nUnfortunately, my laptop only has one HDMI out (RTX 4070), so I can’t use the dual HDMI trick (one to soundbar, one to TV).\n\nSo now I’m torn — did I save $270 smartly, or did I miss out on a better TrueHD experience with the Q990F?\nIs Dolby TrueHD really that big of a deal in real-world usage? And is there any reliable workaround to get TrueHD playback on this setup?\n\nWould appreciate any insights or workarounds! 🙏\n\nEdit: PC -&gt; TV -&gt; soundbar connection works.

We have a pretty good relationship but of course we have our moments.\n\nWell about a week ago, my mom was at work and my dad needed to run by the store. He couldn’t wait until mom got back so he asked to borrow my car. I agreed to let him have it as I didn’t have anything I needed to do right then.\n\nWell about 40 minutes later I get a call from him saying he had been in an accident. Of course that scared the shit out of me and I made sure he was okay first. He said he was fine and explained the accident.\n\nLong story short, he ran a stop sign and smacked straight ahead into another vehicle. Luckily, no one got seriously injured. Except my car. Its busted up pretty bad. Without going into much detail the bumper, headlights, hood, and parts of the engine are messed up.\n\nI got my car in the shop and I’m still waiting on the estimated time it will take for me to get it back. Until then though, I need a car to get to and from work. And that’s where the problem is.\n\nSee me and my mom have different work schedules but similar enough to we’re I could see us working something out. She usually goes in an hour earlier than me and gets off about 30 minutes before me. I figured I could drop her off, go to work, than pick her up.\n\nWell my mom hates that idea. She says that she doesn’t want to have to rely on me to pick her up or get her to work on time. She said since she wasn’t involved in the accident she shouldn’t be affected by the consequences. I told her it would just be until I got my car back but she didn’t care.\n\nI was expecting dad to back me up seeing as he’s the reason I got into this mess. But instead he just agreed with her and said I should find a different way. The problem is, there is no different way. There’s no good public transportation system in our town and we live about 45 mins away from where I work.\n\nMy dad then suggested I biked to work which I quickly shut down. I’d rather not have to bike all the way to and from work every day when we could literally just share a car. I told them it was unfair for them not to let me use their car since dad crashed mine.\n\nThen they said I was just being ungrateful as they were already putting a roof over my head and I shouldn’t expect much more from them. I have no idea where they even thought I was being ungrateful. All I’m saying is why would I choose a harder, more time consuming way to work when there is an easier option.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? I feel like at the least dad could convince mom to let me use their car since this is his fault. But instead, he’s just sitting there agreeing with everything she says. I would ask my siblings to chime in on this, but knowing them they’ll just agree with my parents. So AITAH?\n\nTL;DR: my dad crashed my car. It’s in the shop for I don’t know how long. I need a way to get to and from work. My mom is refusing to let me use their car.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n&amp;nsbp;\n\n[AITAH my parents kicked me out the house with no warning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/kjRJYz6ESZ): **April 9, 2025 (a bit over a month later)** \n\nFor a little backstory I’ve (21M) had been living with my parents due to some recent life events. About a month ago I made a post here talking about how my dad crashed my car and my mom refused to let me use theirs for my commute to work. Long story short, my parents ended up paying for the expenses to have my car fixed. We did also end up sharing a car until I had mines back.\n\nAfter that I thought it was done and over. My mom made a comment about it here and there but it didn’t seem to seriously bother her. Until about a week and a half ago. She demanded that I pay them all the money from my car expenses back.\n\nShe said it wasn’t fair she lost money to an accident she didn’t cause. And I think thats fair, but I reminded her that I didn’t cause it either. Dad caused the accident and I told her I’m sorry that it ended up affecting her as well. But that didn’t change the fact my car had to be fixed and it was Dad’s responsibility. She got really mad at that and started on a rant about how it was unfair and I was using them for money. And what was my dad’s response to all this? He just agreed with her.\n\nI ended up just telling her what I’ve already said because there was honestly nothing else to say. She’s been very upset with me since then. But she never mentioned any possibility of kicking me out. So imagine my surprise a couple days ago when I came home to all of my stuff being outside of the house in boxes. Literally on the curb.\n\nI was honestly shocked (and mad) about this and I immediately went in the house to question my parents about this. My mom said that she was tired of letting someone so ungrateful live in her house. My dad just repeated what my mom said but in a kinder way because I guess he thought she was b eing harsh.\n\nI couldn’t believe it. I asked her to explain how I have been being ungrateful and she responded by basically saying we raised you. We went back and fourth for a bit and we were both pretty mad at each other. Then my mom told me to leave the house or else she would call the police on me.\n\nI have no idea if anything actually would have came of hat situation. But at that point I was so confused and angry that I just went outside and called around to find someone I was able to stay with. I ended up sleeping at a friends house. It’s been a couple days now and siblings have both been calling me. I guess my parents must have told them what happened. I’m assuming it was specifically my mom bad talking me to them.\n\nMy sister agrees with my mom and says I should have just paid the money back. My brother agrees that it was unfair for them to kick me out, but also says I should have just paid the money back. My dad has also been trying to reach me, but honestly I’ve just been too mad to pick up the phone for him.\n\nI’m just so shocked by the whole situation. I wouldn’t say me and my parent’s relationship has always been easy street but it’s never been this bad. I honestly thought we were good until all this. The worst part is I was planning to move out and rent and apartment with a friend once their lease was up in 2 months. My parents knew that and still decided to do this. I’m just so confused and I don’t understand we’re they’re coming from.\n\nI get they raised me and took care of me and all that, but I just feel like that doesn’t give them the right to do this all of a sudden. I don’t think I did anything wrong. So honestly AITAH in this situation?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/5U3jqsQOCQ): **April 10, 2025 (next day)** \n\nSome things have happened since my last post. I calmed down a bit and decided to finally answer one of my dad’s calls. He started talking about how afraid he was that I was never going to talk to them again. Then he said that things weren’t supposed to go that way the other day and apologized for Mom putting my stuff outside. Apparently the plan was to talk to me about it first but he said Mom got caught up in her emotions. When I asked why he didn’t step in, he said it was because he didn’t want to upset her anymore.\n\nI didn’t really want to accept that excuse but I took it so we could move forward. That was until I got another call from my brother. Mom’s been absolutely shit talking me to him and my sister. Apparently she kept comparing me to them and how good their doing (mind you their both older than me by several years). Then she went on a rant about how much harder it’s been to raise me compared to them. At one point he says she even insinuated that I was a mistake. Though he says to take that with a grain of salt as she didn’t outright say it. My brother was uncomfortable with listening to her talk about me so harshly and he decided to call and tell me.\n\nI’m feeling a mix of emotions about all this right now. Part of me is still mad about the whole suddenly kicking me out thing. But I’m mostly just sad about it all. Knowing that my mom is saying all this stuff behind my back only makes me think she really means it. And whether she outright said it or not, hearing that she thinks I’m a mistake honestly crushed my soul. I don’t understand why still but I guess she has her reasons.\n\nI don’t really want to talk to her again, but I do really want to know the truth of why she feels this way about me. I’m not sure about Dad yet. I’m not the type to cut people off and having to do it to one person is already too much for me. I’m still staying with my friend as of now until I figure out what I’m doing. I guess I’ll see how it goes from here.\n\nTl;dr: My dad called and apologized. My mom told my siblings I was a mistake while shit talking me. I’m still trying to figure things out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Rd7i90zvvp): **April 14, 2025 (four days later)** \n\nSo a lot more has happened over the last few days. First I went back home the other day to grab some important things I needed. I waited to go back over there until I knew my mom would be at work and tried to make it quick cause I didn’t particularly want to see my dad either.\n\nWhile I was in there I did tell him what Mom had said about me. He did seem shocked she would say that to me or my siblings. But when I asked if this is the first time she’s ever said that, he admitted that she’s told him that more than a few times. When asked if he knew why, he just told me she has her reasons but they’re not my fault. I tried to get him to explain more but that’s really as far as he would go. I don’t really know how I should feel about that but I just went with it. I asked if that’s how he felt about me too. He said it’s not and that he loves me. It hasn’t really felt like that’s true and I wanted to say that to him, but I just ended up saying okay. I told him I’m cutting Mom completely off and him too for now. After that I took my stuff and left.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago. I got a very angry series of messages from my sister about how horrible I am for turning our brother against our mom. She said I made mom cry and that I should be ashamed of myself. Needless to say I had no idea what she was talking about. As far as I knew my brother wasn’t against anyone in this situation so I was just confused. I tried to ask her to explain but I should know by now that I never get an answer from that. So instead I called my brother to ask him directly.\n\nApparently mom found out that I knew about what she said(I’m assuming dad told her). Then she called my brother and screamed at him for “going behind her back” and telling me. To which he responded that she was the only one saying things behind peoples backs and that she was being unreasonably mean to me for no real reason. He told her she should get her priorities straight and go yell at dad for causing this whole thing. Then he told her not to call him again if all she was going to do was yell about someone or something.\n\nI honestly wasn’t expecting that from my brother. He’s not the type to step into conflict if he doesn’t have too. But obviously her yelling at him set him off. Im not trying to say I’m happy she did that, but I am happy my brother responded the way he did. Obviously she cares more about what he thinks than she does me.\n\nI told my brother about what dad says and he agrees his response feels weird. I asked if he possibly knows why since he’s a bit older than me but he’s just as shocked about this all as I am. He also said he would talk to my sister about everything and get her to back off.\n\nSo now I’m waiting to see how things go with that. Like I said before I’m not the type to cut people off but if my mom is just going to use my sister to talk to me I’m going to block her too. Also as far as housing goes, I decided to take my friend up on his offer and stay until my other friends lease is up. That’s the update for now.\n\nTl;dr: Tried to ask my dad if he knew why my mom was saying this stuff. He just kind of danced around the answer. My mom got mad at my brother for telling me what she said, and he surprisingly stood up to her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/wWqNQsIHrg): **April 26, 2025 (12 days later from the previous update)**\n\nI had a conversation with my dad a few days ago. My brother and I talked him into giving me a better response than mom has her “reasons”. I just wanted to know why or if mom had any reason for saying what’s she said. And he finally told me.\n\nThe story according to Dad is him and my mom were in their late thirties/early forties when they found out mom was pregnant again. Which I did know and after reading some comments thought might be contributing to this whole thing. At the time they had decided that they were fine with just my siblings and were done having children. So it wasn’t the best surprise to them. But they didn’t have any option but to go along with it. Apparently the pregnancy was super hard for my mom. He said she was always in and out of the hospital. It put a lot of stress on my parents and they had to worry about mom’s life and mine. Eventually Mom began feeling some type of resentment. Dad even said that Mom started to question if the pregnancy being so bad was a sign God didn’t want her to have me.\n\nAnd the birth was apparently also very traumatic for her. She ended up having to give birth prematurely due to complications and lost a lot of blood during the process. Which led to more pain and resentment. Dad said mom had a hard time connecting with me as a baby and that she said it didn’t “feel right”. Then when I was a kid I had some health issues which added more stress onto their plate. So Mom eventually started believing that God had made some type of mistake and accidentally “punished” them with me.\n\nI want to say that hearing that did make me sad for mom. And I do feel bad for what she went through to bring me into this world. But at the same time I didn’t choose for her to do that. So to get blamed for it seems unfair. They had a decision to prevent this if they didn’t want it. And they actively chose not too. Or at least Dad did as in his own words he “doesn’t believe in contraception”. He did also mention another reason though. Mom never wanted me to move back into the house. She had been waiting so long for the house to be empty already. So was angry at the thought of me staying at home once again. He said she always thought my reasoning was stupid and that I was overreacting. Dad ended up convincing her to let me stay for a little while though. Though I think Dad believes the same. He just didn’t want to seem bad.\n\nI’m not going to go into too much detail about why I moved back in. But to sum it up, my abusive ex tried to literally kill me. So I had to find a new place to stay quick and at the time everything was too expensive for me. Plus none of my friends lived nearby then. So my parents were the best choice, and I thought they were fine with it. I’ve never seen it as a point of tension between us, but I will say that my dad’s made fun of me more than a few times for it. I assume that’s what mom’s view is too on it. That it’s a stupid excuse. So that’s what my dad says mom’s reasoning for all this is. And he’s as close as I can get to asking her directly so I’m going to have to take his word for it.\n\nAfter hearing all of this, I’m not really sure what to make of it. I wouldn’t say it helped, and honestly has made me feel a bit worse somehow. But Im stupid for looking for an answer in the first place. I’ve been so stressed and confused and sad lately that I probably just would have done better accepting the woman may have hated me for no reason.\n\nBut now that I’ve gotten that, I’m still cutting off my mom, dad, and my sister because she still won’t even listen to me. Her and my mom are still harassing me and I’m just not even in a state of mind to deal with it all anymore. I know I said I’m not the cutting off type, but I realized I’m going to feel horrible either way. So why not just remove myself. Obviously they’ve never wanted me around anyways.\n\nAnd a bit of an update on my current situation. My friends have still been supporting me and helping me through all this. Which I cannot be more grateful for because if it wasn’t for them I honestly don’t know if I could handle all this. In worse news, my job let me know I was being let go. Which isn’t related to this situation at all but just feels like a kick in the face. I don’t know what I did to piss the universe off but obviously things aren’t going in my favor.\n\nSo my plan is still to stay with my friend and get an apartment with another one once their lease is up in two months. But now I just also have to find another job.\n\nAnyways that’s the update. I’m sorry it’s so long but so much has happened and been said. I’m feeling absolutely terrible right now and I’m just trying to get pass all this. Hopefully in a couple months I can come back and update you with more positive news\n\nTl;dr: Dad finally told me some reasons Mom was doing this. Didn’t make me feel any better. I’m still blocking him, her, and my sister. Life sucks right now, lost my job, but I’ve had my friends supporting me and helping me through.\n\nAlso thank you for all the extremely kind and encouraging comments and messages everyone has been sending. Reading through the advice and people who have gone through similar experiences truly has helped. I couldn’t be more thankful ❤️.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bxDF6ycxM4): **October 4, 2025 (5.5 months later from the previous update)**\n\n(Update #4) AITAH my parents kicked me out without warning\n\nIt’s been a while since I updated on my situation. A few people have been asking if I’m alright and if things have gotten better. So I decided to just make another post about what’s currently happening.\n\nFor starters, I still haven’t talked to my mom over the past few months. From the few things I have heard though she has begun acting like I don’t even exist. She’s stopped bringing me up so much when talking to my siblings. She’s apparently gotten rid of any photos that have me in them. Then she’s started referring to my siblings as her only two children. Especially my brother who she keeps making it a point to call her only son. My brother is tired of arguing back and forth with her so he ignores whenever she says stuff like that. And honestly I don’t really mind her doing any of that. It hurts of course but it’s right on track with everything else she’s said and done the past few months. Plus it’s really only fair since I haven’t talked to her.\n\nI haven’t talked to my dad either. I do know he has asked my brother about me a few times. Part of me does feel bad for not talking to him. I have a feeling though that if I did talk to him again a lot of it would be about how I should try and talk to Mom. And I don’t want to do that.\n\nAs for my sister, I actually have spoken to her. My brother finally convinced her the whole situation wasn’t totally my fault. So we’ve talked a little bit. Not a whole bunch but it’s something. And when it comes to my brother, I believe these last few months have been the most I’ve talked to him. It’s been great. I feel like our relationship is better then it’s ever been. And having at least one person from my family on my side has made things easier.\n\nMy living situation has also gotten better. I did manage to secure a new job after I lost mine. A couple of months ago me and my friend did move in together. Which has been going great. And just my friends in general have been supporting me throughout all this. Been going through a rough patch mentally lately. Not only because of the whole getting kicked out thing but a combination of stuff that happened before and after that. So just having people there to take my mind off of stuff has helped a lot actually.\n\nSo that’s the update. My situation has improved quite a bit. My life is less chaotic now. Feeling emotionally drained still but I assume that will change over time. And also thanks for the kind messages and check ins people have been sending me. I’ve been off of here for a little while so coming back to that was nice.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Good to know that things are getting better. But I think your father and siblings are still spineless cowards, because they tolerate the fact that your mom is erasing you. If I were your brother, I\'d literally slap her face and wouldn\'t stop until she recognises that she is the monster - that\'s how much I\'d be disgusted by her.\n\nBut hey, we can\'t have everything, right?\n\nBTW - what about your extended family? Or the family\'s friends? Someone had to notice that your mom suddenly mentally switched?\n\nStill, good to know that at least you\'re finally on the path to rebuilding yourself. Millions of hugs! Take care!\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thanks. I don’t have a connection to any of my extended family. Im sure someone probably has noticed her acting different, but I don’t know any of them to ask.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Take care! But consider talking to your dad. You can always say no or hang up. Closure might be overrated but in this case it feels sensible.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Thanks. And I might consider speaking to him again. Not anytime soon but you’re right that I could always just hang up. So maybe at some point in the future.\n\n**Do OOP\'s siblings still live at home?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No, my siblings are older than me. They moved out years before I did.\n\n**Commenter 3:** You need a paternity test before you allow your father back in to your life. No point in giving a man who lets his wife abuse you access to hurt you more if she hates you because she cheated.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I could try that. I honestly don’t think she cheated though. There are things I can tell were passed down from my dad.\n\n**OOP should consider about having therapy to help with the issues**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah I have. I think it could help a bit and my friends keep pushing me to do it. So at some point I probably will.\n\n**Commenter 4:** I’m shocked that anyone in your family thinks this is your fault at all tbh. I just got here but read your prior posts. You held your dad accountable for an accident he caused, and this blew up into world war 3 because your mom clearly hasn’t been to therapy. Is everyone just afraid to upset her? Why did your siblings or parents think you should have paid them back for the repairs in the first place? He broke it, he pays for it.\n\nDid your mom even want kids to begin with? Can’t imagine wanting an empty house so badly that your kids are unwelcome to come home if life happens. Is there a cultural nuance here that I may be missing as a white American? I’d be grateful my adult kid felt safe enough to come to me for help if life went awry as yours did. What the hell.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** No you’re not missing anything. I think the only reason they think it’s my fault is because I should have just paid it back. Or simply paid for it myself in the first place. Then it wouldn’t have spiraled into this. Also for my mom I think she believes I was being ungrateful for asking them to pay for the repairs. Which I don’t think I was, or at least I wasn’t trying to be. Mom did want kids, just not me. After I moved out I’m sure she thought she was done with all that. So me needing to move back in was a kind of a kick in the face to her. Which I can understand, it’s just the fact that I wasn’t even staying for that much longer. And I only moved in because I literally couldn’t stay where I was before.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o3lw8q/new_update_aitah_my_dad_crashed_my_car_and_my/', 2565, 247, '2025-10-11 04:04:05', '2025-11-08 01:36:51'),

She had this antique music box that she gave to me before she got too sick. It meant a lot to her so I always kept it close and you know I wanted to save it for future kids and to remind me of mom. It was always in my room and I didn\'t listen to it a lot but just looking at it reminded me of her because she used to dance to the music.\n\nMy dad remarried 2 years ago and his wife and I got along fine for the most part. It was sorta tense because she thought I\'d want a motherly figure and she\'d get to do parental stuff. She built it all up in her head and she struggled when that wasn\'t what I wanted. We kinda figured it out but didn\'t get close and then her and my dad had a baby together and my half sibling was her focus so all was fine.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago I got home from school and the music box was missing from my room. When I asked her if she\'d seen it she lied and said no. I asked my dad when he got home from work and he said no. He asked me if I moved it without realizing and I said no. I tore my room up looking for it and I searched other rooms in the house. No music box.\n\nI went to bed that night and heard my dad\'s wife tell dad she had sold it to pay for medicine for my half sibling. She said someone bought it off ebay for 2k or something and she waited until she was sending it out to take it because she thought I wouldn\'t notice immediately. When I heard her say that I ran down stairs and yelled at her. My dad told me to calm down and that we could talk it out. His wife said I needed to understand that my half sibling needed medicine they couldn\'t afford and the music box sold for money to cover it. She said there was no other way. I told her she had no right and it was mom\'s before and mine now and she was a thief. She defended her decision and told me I was putting a box before my half sibling\'s health.\n\nI told her she better get it back and she said she couldn\'t and wouldn\'t. So I called her a disgusting POS and I told her she was dead to me, she\'s not my family and she\'s worthless trash and I wasn\'t going to live with her or speak to her again. My dad was still trying to calm us both down.\n\nI packed up my stuff and texted my grandpa to come pick me up. My dad\'s wife started yelling at me for waking my half sibling up. Dad was like sleep it off and we\'ll talk in the morning and when grandpa pulled up he tried to stop me leaving. I said I wasn\'t spending the night under the same roof as that (just imagine the insult). My dad was trying to say I couldn\'t leave but I left anyway.\n\nMy dad has tried to get me to go back home ever since. He told me we need to talk about it as a family and I said there is no family anymore, and his wife is dead to me and I won\'t have anything to do with her again and I used all the insults I did that night and some more. He told me not to say those things and I need to find a way to forgive. He said he can get his wife to apologize but we need to move on. I refused. He said he\'s going to fight my grandparents and he\'ll press charges if and when he can. I said I\'ll sleep under a bridge, I\'ll sleep in a shelter or at the park. I said he can\'t make me go back. I said I want nothing more to do with his wife.\n\nHe said I don\'t need to overreact like this and I owe her an apology too because treating someone like I treated her and talking about her like I am is disgusting and wrong. And he said I can\'t run away when I don\'t like what happens. I told him mom\'s music box is gone because of the (insult) he married which pissed my dad off.\n\nAITAH?', 'Mylooy', 'AITAH', 'https://reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1obfp9v/aitah_for_moving_out_of_my_dads_house_and_telling/', 5042, 1331, '2025-10-20 09:59:40', '2025-11-08 01:36:51'),

(I don\'t know why, but women seem as likely to pull this crap as men in my experience).  This woman asks to speak to one of my male colleagues instead. \n\nNow normally, this is where you explain politely yet condescendingly that about 70 percent of your average call center employees are women and that we don\'t index our phone lines by the contents of the employee\'s underpants.  So while we can transfer them back to the queue to try a different rep, they\'ll have to wait in line again, and may or may not get someone who can sign their name in the snow with a stream of urine.  Most of the time, they reluctantly accept the fact that they have to deal with a woman this time.  This woman didn\'t.  So I sent her back into the queue to try her luck again.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, I get her again.  \"Thank you for calling, my name is ThundaCunt.  How many I help you today?\". She didn\'t recognize me at first, and angrily gave me her name and a complaint about being put on hold by \"the last woman\".  I recognized her name and shitty demeanor immediately.  So in my best bitchy-polite customer service voice, said \"Oh yes, Ms. Cuntington, I believe I was the one who spoke to you earlier.

You can hear the gear in her brain grinding to a halt for a moment, then, angrily \"What are you some sort of *tranny!?*\".  To which I reply cheerfully, like she just noticed my new haircut, \"Why yes, how did you know?\".

We divorced over 5 years ago and coparent very well, the divorce was because I was happy with our two children but he wanted more, and even therapy didn\'t help. We have had basically no issues, there\'s no child support (we\'re 50/50), have never had issues having the kids if the other parent has something come up, and understand that it\'s just about making sure their lives aren\'t too disrupted.\n\nGreg remarried Tessie (38f) four years ago and they have another child, a boy, and another about to make their appearance in this world in a few weeks. I am marrying my fiance Luke (36m) in February, we\'ve been together for about 3 years and he\'s known my kids for 2, we moved in together last year. We have a group chat, but aren\'t overly friendly or anything - we only talk about the kids and keep it pretty lighthearted. Our only \'rules\' with the other datings is that we would introduce our partners to the other before they met the kids, which went great with both of them. When Tessie and Greg married, I obviously kept the kids an extra week for their honeymoon, and again for my actual week so they could settle in (they didn\'t live together before they got married). When they had their first baby, I kept our kiddos for about a month (but brought them over a few times to see their new brother obviously) so they could settle in since it was Tessie\'s first baby.\n\nA few weeks ago at one of Lacie\'s games, Tessie told me the date her c-section was scheduled for, which is in the middle of their custody week. I told her we were excited for them and of course I could keep them that week and my following week, and we could go back to normal their next custody period. She kind of hemmed and hawed and asked if we could keep them for another custody week to give them a month again to get used to things. I said that was fine, I didn\'t expect them to need that much time for their second baby, but C-sections are major surgeries and I said I\'d be happy to keep the kid, they don\'t live far from us so bringing them over to hang out won\'t be too out of my way and of course I love having my kids with me.\n\nAnyhoo, we\'ve finalized our plan for our honeymoon, which is 3 weeks. I know it seems excessive but it\'s something on both of our bucket lists, but not something the kids would be too interested in, and the honeymoon seems like the best opportunity to do it. Basically what would happen would be that we\'d get married on Saturday (my week), the kids would stay with Greg that night and stay for his week, then they would keep them for our week and their next week. So they\'d have them for one of my custody weeks plus one extra evening. I don\'t have family around, my parents died young, grandparents before them, and the aunt and uncle who helped raise me retired to New Mexico (3 hour plan ride + 2 hour drive at min). I have friends who have watched the kids before, but I didn\'t see a single issue with asking Greg to keep them for a week since it seems like there\'s a bit of precedent. I texted him the general plan and emailed him a more detailed one with locations, days, times etc so he could know where we were/ how to contact us if there was an issue.\n\nI thought all was well and good, but they never responded until a few days later they emailed me what Luke and I jokingly now refer to as The Manifesto. It was long, rambling, repetitive, and still somehow partially written by ChatGPT. The gist of it was:\n\n\\- what kind of mother on a three week vacation without her kids\n\n\\- I\'m a terrible person in general for asking a young mother to have her stepkids full-time for three weeks while I go and enjoy myself (they/ she kept calling Tessie a young mother, I think she means mother of young kids and I know it\'s not the point but it kept annoying me. also it wouldn\'t be alone with her - Greg would obviously be there)\n\n\\- I am a horrible coparent for asking them to have the kids for three straight weeks while their kids are so young (their newest baby will be 6 months old by then btw)\n\n\\- Apparently it\'s all well and fine that Luke and I don\'t want anymore kids (he has had a vasectomy and known he didn\'t want kids of his own for a while), but we\'d better not think that gives us permission to \'dump\' Louisa and Ted on them to galivant around (I don\'t think I\'ve ever galivanted in my entire life!)\n\n\\- We needed to figure our own weeks out ourselves, this was not life or death and it was ridiculous to ask them.\n\nI got petty after this, especially them acting as if we are constantly \'dumping\' the kiddos on them, so I went through the last four years of texts and made a spreadsheet of how many times either of us has asked the other to keep the kids and the duration on an excel sheet. While we both have made these requests, they have done so for 87 nights (52 times) vs me 12 nights (8 times). Obviously, this makes sense since they have a baby, and I didn\'t send it to them or anything, but it was good to know I\'m not crazy.\n\nMy friends say I should tell them that, fine, I won\'t keep them during their custody time after their new baby comes. I\'m not going to do that. I love my kids and want to see them as much as I can! But I do a lot extra for them, just some examples:\n\n\\- I (sometimes Luke if he\'s off work) pick the kids up every single day after school, and on Greg\'s custody weeks I drop them off at their house since he doesn\'t get off until 5 so that Tessie doesn\'t have to take the baby out to pick them up (keep in mind that she does not work anymore)\n\n\\- Our divorce decree says that whoever\'s week it is must drop the kids off at the other parent\'s house, but I\'ve been doing all of the back and forth for a while again because they have a kid and because it\'s not THAT far (5 minute drive, 20 minute walk if it\'s nice).\n\n\\- I take the kids to all of their appointments, do all of the school parent stuff during the day, etc since I have a super flexible schedule and Greg\'s isn\'t, he would need to use PTO for all of this stuff.\n\n\\- We usually split health insurance per the divorce decree, they\'re on his work\'s insurance but since I take them to all of their appointments etc I pay all of the copays. I keep a tally just in case I would end up owing him money (and I know what he pays towards the premiums), and in the past it was minimal, but our daughter unfortunately has Type 1 diabetes which has gotten pretty expensive. It wasn\'t killing me, but Greg mentioned how tight money was once when I was bringing it up and I decided that it\'s not affecting my life, our daughter needed it, so I\'ve been letting it go.\n\n\\- Their son has been in the process of being diagnosed with autism, and has pretty bad meltdowns (this is all I know from Greg), so they call me pretty frequently to see if I can come and get the kids for a few hours if things are overwhelming. Of course I love my kids and spending time with them, but I\'ve had to cancel plans for this and they have not cared. Greg was in an accident and has been using my old car (I got a new one and hadn\'t sold the old one yet, it\'s not worth a ton or anything) for the past 7 months, with no effort to replace it.\n\n\\- Greg travels sometimes for work, and they (greg and the kids) have a cat over there. Normally Louisa would take care of the litter box if Greg was travelling, but since her diagnoses and until we get her labs/ health under some form of control, we BOTH agreed that we don\'t want her messing with it (they let the cat go outside during the day). Since Tessie has been pregnant she said she shouldn\'t have to, and Ted is a little young (he tried, failed, now he \'helps\' lol), so I\'ve been doing it.\n\nAnyways, these are all benefits for them that I\'m going to inform them are ending. I won\'t go back on my word to have the kiddos after she has her c-section, but the absolute gall of them to not do the one thing that I have asked of them (and that I\'ve done for them!) have brought me to this. Most of my friends say I\'m not going far enough, but a few have said that it might cause a breakdown in our coparenting relationship, which would affect the kids. That\'s really the only thing I care about, so now I\'m hesitant.\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/y5x9jdATm1): **August 15, 2025 (three days later)**\n\nUpdate: WIBTAH if I stop doing all favors for my ex since he refused to do one for me?\n\nHey everyone I don\'t know how to link on mobile so my last post is in my profile. I got way too overwhelmed with the responses but like I thought, I was completely being taken advantage of and the friends telling me to let it go can suck it. (JK I know where they were coming from they were just wrong and my egg Greg and Tessie do need to be introduced to my good friend Reality).\n\nOne thing I didn\'t mention in my last post is that Greg and I have a long history, I\'ve known him forever since we moved to his mom\'s neighborhood when I was 4, we were always friendly and then we started hooking up when I was in college and got pregnant. In his defense, he 100% stood up, married me, took care of us, paid for everything while I finished school, and even paid for my college. But even before all that, he\'s always been a great guy and my friend, I know it seems like I was being taken advantage of but of course over the years people probably thought I was taking advantage of him before I started making the big bucks. It was me who filed for divorce, he said he could probably go to therapy and find a way to make it work but I knew I couldn\'t ask him to do that.\n\nAnd there has been reciprocity in other ways, after we divorced he definitely helped me a lot in setting up my new home (before Luke and I got together). Doing things like mowing, cleaning the gutters, fixing appliances. Obviously those things don\'t happen anymore, but I\'m just saying it hasn\'t always been me doing everything. Finally, all of this has NOT been thankless. Up until The Manifesto, they were incredibly and vocally grateful and appreciative. Doing things for appreciative people is great and makes me feel good, unfortunately now that we are living in the Post Manifesto Era, I don\'t get any joy from helping them out like I used to.\n\nWith all that being said, I can\'t continue bending over backwards for him just because he was good to me before.\n\nAnyways I got pretty mad at myself at my last post and decided to respond to The Manifesto, as I was hyping myself up though Greg called. I was pretty amped so I decided to answer.\n\nHe started with apologizing. He didn\'t say it directly, but I got the gist that Tessie wrote the email in anger because of how overwhelming everything is. He reminded me that it wasn\'t just his son\'s issues, Louisa was also struggling to get her diabetes under control (any other type 1 parents can probably relate), and she misread my email to think that I was asking for them to keep them for 3 of my custody periods for a total of 6 weeks. Going back to The Manifesto I can kind of see where she was saying that, but it wasn\'t the most coherent thing to begin with. He said one week for our honeymoon is totally fine and they will figure it out.\n\nHe acknowledged that it was entirely inappropriate and uncalled for. Unluckily for him I was not in the best mood and told him damn straight it was one of the most deranged and untrue emails I\'ve ever read. I asked him if anything they wrote in the email rang true to him in the cold light of day and he admitted no.\n\nI had kind of been going back and forth on this, and was originally going to tell him to go to hell and we would never switch custody times again, I didn\'t care if they had 5 more kids with c-sections, but I decided against going that far. I told him that I would get the kids when Tessie had her C-Section, keep them through my custody, and would expect them to have them back during his next custody period - which still gave them 10 days to recover etc. If he needed more help, I expected him to figure out any extra childcare for our kids like he will need to with his other son. He started arguing but I just bulldozed through and told him that he could make this and all of the other times I\'ve helped him out with childcare by watching the kids during my week during my honeymoon. He said that sounded fair and thanked me.\n\nBut I told him that the email was so far out of line that that any and all extras I\'ve been doing were over immediately. He could either find a new carpool (no bus, private school) or I would keep picking the kids up from school but he or Tessie could get them from my home during their weeks. If they are unable to care for the children due to their son\'s meltdowns or their new baby, I would be willing to help them, but warned them that due to their accusations I would *start* (LOL) tracking this and if I thought it was becoming an issue I would file for primary custody. I asked him if that would help, he could have the kids every other weekend, I wouldn\'t demand child support in light of his very difficult situation (even though I know I could) and he insisted that wasn\'t necessary, that it was on them to figure things out.\n\nHe really didn\'t have a lot to say back to any of this and apologized again. I told him that it wasn\'t impossible to rebuild the trust we have had in the past, but it was going to take a lot of time and hard work on his and his wife\'s part because I was done putting in so much just to get attacked. He promised he understood and he\'d figure everything else out. I told him that since this was another verbal (aka not legally binding) agreement, the first time either of them slips up, makes outrageous demands, or says anything remotely close to what she wrote in that email, I would bring down the hammer because due to the attacks on my character I now had a lawyer on retainer (hadn\'t met with the lawyer yet but sometimes you need to bluff). He confirmed he understood.\n\nTessie sent me a text apology, it seemed sincere but I don\'t trust her. I know Greg wouldn\'t throw her under the bus, but the fact that she thought it was ok to send such a demeaning and demonizing email to me after all I\'ve done for her really ruined any grace I was willing to give her. I sent her a short acknowledgement text, and went on with my day. \n\nBoth their lives are about to get much, much more difficult. If they try to put any of that discomfort or difficulties on my kids I will move swiftly, but also if it means that my kids get a little less at their dads house than they do here, that\'s not the worst lesson for them. Their needs will always be met, I know that, and they\'ve been in therapy for a while so while I\'m concerned that Tessie could take her frustrations out on them, I truly think they would tell me. I read so many other stories on here and realized that \n\nTwo things:\n\nSo the thing with the car - it\'s meant for my friend\'s stepdaughter for when she gets her permit. She is 15, and we all love her so much but she has that disease that 15 year olds get where she really doesn\'t have any motivation whatsoever. So I was talking about all this to said friend, she told her husband, and he marched upstairs and told his daughter to get dressed so she could go and take her permit test. She failed :) but is going to try again next week, and he is purchasing the car next week - Greg knows and knows he has until then to acquire a new one.\n\nAnd the cat isn\'t Tessie\'s cat. It was Greg\'s guilty divorced dad first Christmas gift lol. I really like the cat, she\'s very sweet and snuggly and I haven\'t minded helping especially since Louisa does feel bad she doesn\'t do it anymore. Honestly if it wasn\'t for that I probably wouldn\'t have agreed to help! Luckily the induction is soon, and Greg won\'t be travelling for a while, so its a moot point. Obviously if they were to decide to get pregnant again, they would need to hire someone to do the litter box going forward. I\'ve probably only done it three times, but I see that was crossing some boundaries I should have put up. \n\nI\'m going to keep enjoying the life that I\'ve worked hard to build - I know they\'ll always be around and in my life, and it\'s unfortunate for them that the choices they made got them in this situation, but they\'re going to have to rebuild their village. I\'m excited for the wedding and especially excited to go to Japan! Those things and of course my kiddos are my focus going forward. Peace!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Ex’s new son has autism - what are the right boundaries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/s/UxfX9R0Vt5): **August 16, 2025 (next day)**\n\nSo my ex and I had some recent issues to say the least, and I’m completely pulling back any favors that I used to do. It’s deserved on his and his wife’s end, but it is going to hurt them. They have a little boy who’s 3-4ish, and it seems profoundly autistic (still not speaking, has meltdowns, self-injures). In the past, since I live close, if their son was having a very-severe meltdown and my kids were there they’d ask me to come and get them and I usually would.\n\nUnfortunately, they have behaved badly and I will no longer be doing this. They’re also about to have another baby, which I’m sure will be stressful as well, so I understand it will be difficult. I obviously don’t want my kids to have to deal with anything traumatic, the little boy is still their brother and they do love him. And I think it’s important for them to have the time with their father and his family.\n\nThat being said, I obviously want what’s best for my kids. How to I help them remain positive while also protecting them?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Vbp9ahGQp6): **October 15, 2025 (two months later)**\n\n**Update: aitah for not wanting to do any more favors for my ex?**\n\nI posted before about stopping doing any favors for my (30f) ex Greg 38m and his wife Tessie 38 after she sent me an unhinged email after I asked them to keep Greg and my kids (7 and 9) for one of my custody weeks while I go on my honeymoon with my fiancé Luke. lol hey hope you’re all doing well. Just another day in paradise over here. I’m mostly joking, things have been good. \n\nGreg and Tessie had another little boy like a month ago. I did take the kids for one of their custody weeks. Tessie is still mad at me though and sent me this whole long text the week before telling me that when I brought the kids to the hospital to see the baby she didn’t want me bringing them up and they’d just have to figure out how to get upstairs themselves because Greg would be busy but I’d need to stay and not leave because she didn’t know how long they could be there. I was just like… okay? I know with their last kid they specifically invited me in to meet the baby but that’s not a big deal to me i know this sounds bad but I really don’t like babies lol. But then it made me be like, I don’t need to be at the woman’s beck and call so I just had Greg’s mom take the kids to meet the baby which was apparently NOT the right call and I got in trouble for lol. I also have stopped the group chat thing and am only communicating with Greg. Yes Tessie still contacts me but I don’t respond or acknowledge them unless it’s directly about the kids. \n\nBut otherwise I’ve just not let their drama affect us. I dont bring these things up but they basically told Luke that when their brother has a meltdown they just hang out up or downstairs and it’s not that big of a deal to them. But they like when I come and pick them up those little shits ahaha. And they didn’t tell him this in confidence just randomly so I told them they were not being good siblings and they could always call me but that was their family too. So I don’t even feel bad about not picking them up anytime they ask. But sometimes I still do. \n\nBut now I’m in a weird place because obviously I was invited to their wedding and everything but I don’t think I should invite them to ours? Lol i mean obviously not right? We have a lot of mutual friends and apparently she told one of them that if I kept this up (this being not doing whatever they say) that they’d file for child support and the only reason they hadn’t before was because I was helpful. Like good freaking luck with that guys. But when the mutual friend mentioned our wedding - in neutral terms but she’s doing something for it - apparently they acted like they’d be going. So I probably need to figure that whole thing out because they must be smoking crack or something lol. \n\nIgnoring / not helping them with things was pretty hard for me at first. Maybe I was a bit of a people pleaser, but not caring what they think about me has helped a lot with that. I just wanted a good childhood for my kids, but I can only control that over here. \n\nSorry if I missed anything, was bored at lunch and thought I’d update. Have a great day!\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Don’t invite them. They will cause drama. Quit doing stuff for them too. If you have 50/50 custody, good luck with them getting any child support.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I do make quite a bit more than he does so he could be awarded child support. It’s just that those two chose for her to quit working AND I have the kids more than half the time in reality that pisses me off.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Why are you telling your kids they are not good siblings because they go upstairs when their brother has a meltdown? There is nothing wrong with that. Definitely don\'t invite them to the wedding, are you nuts? Did they agree to help you out on your honeymoon?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That’s not what I said. I told them they shouldn’t tell me to come and get them just because they prefer being over here and using it as an excuse. He’s their brother. They did agree to that but I have backup in case they try something while I’m across the world\n\n**Commenter 3:** Tell your ex that they are not invited because the relationship is no longer healthy and you will strictly co-parent with him but not have a friendship as it is now toxic. Then continue to ice them out. Mutual friends will understand if they are actually friends. It isn’t healthy for the kids to see this dynamic with their step mom. Don’t ruin your wedding because you think it might be awkward if they don’t get invited\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Oh they’re not coming and I have no idea why they think I’d invite them after everything. I might just ignore it.\n\n**Commenter 4:** If you haven\'t already done so, create a document that shows which day you\'ve had the kids and maintain it going forward.  \n\nIf they take you to court, hire an attorney and ask to have the custody officially changed to match the history of overnight visits.  Also, ask for reimbursement of expenses that should have been shared (medical bills, extracurricular activities, etc...).  Also, ask your lawyer if it would be possible to ask for support for college.  In many US states, that\'s increasingly common.  Basically, if you get served and have to go to court, try to get as many things solved at once as possible.  Make the lawyer\'s bills worthwhile.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Girl I have an entire spreadsheet. I’m not hiring a lawyer unless I really have to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; **Commenter 5:** Because he chose not to have his wife work and you make more money than them does not automatically mean that they are going to get child support. You may not want to hire a lawyer, but if that’s something that they pursue, you would be better off spending the money to hire a lawyer, especially if you can prove that you have the children more than 50% of the time and are constantly being called in because they need assistance. Better to consult with a lawyer before you need one and be prepared to go that route if necessary then to just miss the possibility.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; **OOP:** Her not working wont affect child support, it’s only his income.\n\n**Commenter 6:** Just FYI, not hiring a lawyer can definitely cost you a lot more money in the end. Good job with the spreadsheet.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I’m not disagreeing with you, but i have my own reasons for believing that they’ll never get around to actually trying to file for child support. Like neither of them have the executive function if their lives were going well and between a new baby and a pretty severely disabled kid I am pretty confident that I don’t have anything to worry about there.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I’m wrong I’ll come back and update so you all can tell me I told you so!\n\n**Commenter 7:** Make sure you have a backup plan for your honeymoon because that entitled woman is going to back out of having the kids at the last minute to punish you\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I do 😊 we’ll be in Japan and I could see her doing that after all her bs lately, and don’t want to stress about it.\n\n**Are OOP\'s kids in therapy?**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Kids are in therapy. I do allow them to vent to me, I just draw the line at “we would rather be at moms because he annoys us so let’s ask to go to her house”. I’m not going to have kids who grow into teenagers who think they can just stay at whatever house is owned by the parent they are the least mad at ahah.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocyayb/new_update_wibtah_if_i_stop_all_of_the_favors_ive/', 4346, 319, '2025-10-22 04:04:06', '2025-11-08 01:36:51'),

Hope Hasan notices you, his most dedicated soldier, one day.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They must be employees of Night Media, I refuse to think that there are idiots doing this for free.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What is that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What is what?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Night Media\n\n[How the fuck does anyone on here have time to find these clips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5z6d1/hasan_notices_shock_dog_collar_remote_on_his/?sort=controversial)\n&gt;You mean a sub with million+ people have time to find things when one of the most vile terrorist supporter/dog abuser is lying about shit?\n&gt;&gt;Maybe it’s a sign to take a break……\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Why? Better to show how insane Hasan is and how much he lies and spread misinformation, supports terrorism etc.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because the majority of the world simply does not give a shit about this. These clips really won’t do anything in the long run.  Also, this sub does not have +1 million users here anymore. There’s a reason Reddit hides active user counts now. It’s also not every single person on this subreddit, more so a few hundred scouring his VODs for these clips.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You dont want him to be exposed for abusing his dog?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, that’s not what I said. Each additional clip posted showing the absolute most minute detail in his VOD’s actually weakens the criticism. Post the actual one’s that are issues, sure, but ones like these are fucking stupid. The more of these meaningless clips flooding the front page, the more people will think this is some targeted attack, and not actually bringing to light the issue.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah bro more evidence straight from the source weakens the argument lmao what are you even saying??\n\n[Evidence keeps mounting but there still won’t be any repercussions, from twitch or anyone else, other streamers won’t really say shit because they want his viewers, all they care about is money.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5z6d1/hasan_notices_shock_dog_collar_remote_on_his/njcwmpq/)\n&gt;What should the repercussions be for using a shock collar on your dog?\n&gt;&gt;Using a shock collar on a dog in order to ensure it remains as set dressing? Presumably banned from the platform. At the least a decease in viewership\n&gt;&gt;&gt;keep dreaming lmfao\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don’t like people who abuse animals 🤷‍♂️\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me either but y\'all really think anything will happen?\n\n[I am mind blown how hard people are pushing this shit. Dude shocked his dog. Shit move. But is it really worth analyzing decades of vods over and non stop discussion? There was less discussion over that nazi saying he doesn\'t view the left as human beings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5z6d1/hasan_notices_shock_dog_collar_remote_on_his/njcwh4v/)\n&gt;You underestimate pet people lol\n&gt;&gt;I\'m a pet person. Dogs rock. But at the same time, those collars exist. It\'s not like he created it to torture his dog. Tens of millions of pet owners have them. Nothing he did was illegal or even immoral. Dick move for sure from my point of view, but it\'s not like he applied for ICE and is kidnapping children from schools or some shit.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;That\'s the issue that ultimately got me against this whole thing. I don\'t really watch Hasan, I see him mostly through clips, but I know a witch hunt when I see one, and I\'ve seen them from LSF before.  Ultimately you\'re right, the worst they have is that he lied. Because even if he came out tomorrow and said \"I own a shock collar\", shock collars are legal in his state.  LSF just loves some outrage, fake or otherwise, and they\'re eating good with this.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You\'re not getting it. Hasan is still saying he didn\'t shock his dog. His cult followers are still denying that reality. Until Hasan stops lying and his fans stop believing that lie, evidence has to continue to be presented to expose that lie. It\'s not a witch hunt to expose an asshole that thinks he can lie to your face and get away with it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But who gives a shit? People lie. So who cares? Imagine if people cared about every other lie ever told like they do with this guy claiming he didn\'t shock his dog.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The world would be a much better place if people cared about calling out lies more.\n\n[Do yall ever get tired of being farmed for rage? Like, we are losing our government, Gaza is going to be turned into a vacation resort.

She clearly just gets up and walks out whenever she wants.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;no trust me most people just dont like hasan for lying about everything on the internet, But all of you guys seem to not care and follow the man blindly and it drives people nuts that you guys moved the goal post. first it was \"o she hurt her claw\" and then it was \"o its a vibrator\" now its \"but guys she moves\". legit people outside your community had to figure out the answers when it should be you guys doing it.

Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can\'t thank you enough for all the upvotes and I\'ll keep you posted on this.\n\n[UPDATE 2] Nov 4th 2025\nToday after over two weeks of my warranty claim, I finally recieved an update from my vendor Scan.co.uk. stating user error:\n\n\"The GPU has been received and inspected, and we’ve noted the damage to the power connector consistent with burning. As this type of damage is most commonly caused by incorrect installation or an improperly seated cable, we’re unable to treat it as a warranty claim at this stage. To determine the exact cause, we’ll now need to send the card to MSI for a full inspection. They will confirm whether the fault can be covered under warranty, or if it will need to be treated as a chargeable repair due to customer-induced damage. If MSI advises that the damage is not covered under warranty, we’ll review the situation and, where possible, look to cover the repair cost for you as a goodwill gesture. Our aim is to ensure the matter is resolved fairly and with minimal inconvenience to you. We’ll keep you updated as soon as we have feedback from MSI.\"\n\nThe cable was clearly seated properly as the molten connection proves that it was plugged all the way in when it burned out. I\'ll keep you updated.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won\'t even provide. When I built the PC I\'ve watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&amp;t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it\'s quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.', 'Frygon', 'pcmasterrace', 'https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1obwj09/another_5090_down_in_flames/', 4670, 815, '2025-10-20 22:55:12', '2025-11-08 01:36:51'),

My boyfriend went to his our home state to see his family for the weekend. He\'s been going quite often this year, about once a month, saying it is because his grandparents are old and miss him. I thought nothing of it until this morning. I got a screenshot from a mutual friend of ours of my boyfriend\'s location on snapchat.\n\nHe was at his parents house but a girl\'s bitmoji was there as well. It wasn\'t his sister or mom and his parents (who weirdly also have snapchat) weren\'t home either. He didn\'t tell me he was going to be with anyone one else today. I tried to call him but he did not pick up. I looked on snapchat and his location was turned off.\n\nThe mutual friend says my boyfriend has told everyone at home we had broken up 4 months ago. He said my boyfriend was making him stay quiet about it because he was trying to find the right time to tell me. As far as his parents know, he\'s moving home once our lease is up. The reason our mutual friend told me was because he walked in on my boyfriend and the girl hooking up with each other this morning.\n\nI texted an old friend who lives in my hometown, and she immediately asked why my boyfriend was on tinder. We caught up and she sent me proof his photos on tinder and his bio. It hurt to see that photos I took of him were used. He had even covered my face in a photo we took together and said \"this could be you\".\n\nI had no idea his family thought we were broken up and that he was looking for other people to date. We even went to Italy a month ago celebrating our 7 year anniversary! I\'m so confused and I don\'t know what to do. I look around and everything in our apartment seems like a lie.\n\nThe soon to be ex texted me just now and he is on his flight back. He\'ll be back in about 5 hours. Obviously, he can find his own way to the apartment from the airport.\n\nI\'m shocked and numb, but my best friend is with me helping me pack up all my clothes. I\'m leaving and I\'m not leaving a trace of myself behind. Our dog is coming with me, and I\'ll be staying at my best friend\'s place for now.\n\nMy soon to be ex and I already have separate bank accounts, and our joint bank account does not have much in it right now. I make more than he does so he can keep it. I can\'t go to the leasing office because it\'s closed on Sundays, but I sent an email asking for early termination on the lease. We\'re registered as domestic partners, so I\'ve completed the termination form and will drive it up to the LA county office tomorrow. He is on my health insurance, and I\'ve sent the email to HR to kick him off ASAP.\n\nWe have several large photo albums together, and I\'m not sure what to do with those. Keeping them would be too difficult but I don\'t want him to have the satisfaction of having our photos. It\'s clear he uses our memories in a horrible way.\n\nIs there anything I\'m missing? I can\'t seem to think of anything and all my thoughts seem so jumbled. Nothing makes sense, but I know I can\'t stay. Any help to ghost a person this close to my heart would be appreciated.\n\n***Top Comment:***\n\n**Stinkeye63:** Take pictures or video of the apartment before you leave so he can\'t damage it and claim that you did it.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obsrui/update_my_27f_boyfriend_29m_of_7_years_cheated_on/)**: October 20, 2025 (Next Day)**\n\nThank you everyone for all the solid advice. I\'m compiling everything I did in this first section so if others need a way to cut contact with a person, they can reference this. As mentioned in the comments:\n\n* I logged myself out of our apple TV and xbox\n* I cancelled the wifi that I paid for and returned the modem to the carrier.\n* I took my payment information for utilities off our account.\n* I packed up all my sauces, spices, and cooking oils, and took note to only leave dried rosemary behind (he hates that shit).\n* I printed out and framed the screenshot of his tinder profile and left it on the kitchen table. I closed a piece of dog poop into the frame as well. I\'ll keep the photo albums. He can have this.\n* I took a video of the entire apartment after packing up all my things. I left my keys in the mailbox to the leasing office and emailed the leasing office of my departure with the videos of what the apartment looked like prior to locking up.\n* I updated my address for the USPS, vet, hospital, school, work, and my dog\'s chip.\n* I talked to HR and am in the process of getting him off of my health insurance, changing the benefactor of my life insurance to my parents (if only I could name my dog), and emergency contact.\n* I\'m going to the bank to take myself off the joint bank account. Fortunately, I\'m not worried about my credit as all of our finances have stayed separate, but I\'m grateful to those who told me to freeze my credit.\n* I logged out of all devices for all streaming services, social media, and my work, personal, and school email.\n* I blocked him on all social media, chatrooms, and his phone number.\n* I made a doctor\'s appointment to get STD tested.\n* I\'m on my way to an appointment with the county office to terminate our domestic partnership.\n\nIt\'s been an incredibly busy 18 hours but I\'ve had a lot of help from my friends. I haven\'t been able to sleep either. As far as what happened since he arrived, here\'s what\'s up:\n\nI already blocked him before he landed. I received many texts and calls from his parents and sister that I did not see. Then, when I noticed his sister calling, I picked up. At first, the call was hostile. She accused me of being some crazy ex girlfriend that couldn\'t let her brother go. Funny, since I just packed up and left. She brought up that it had been \"4 months\" and that I needed to move on. I told her that the ex never approached me about breaking up and that 1 month ago, we celebrated our 7th anniversary and started to plan our wedding. I had no indication he even wanted to break up.\n\nWe reset a bit and she allowed me to tell her my side of the story. I told her he was somewhat distant this year, but he had blamed it on their grandparents being old and wanting to spend more time with them before they die. Turns out, their grandparents have been dead for 2 years. I never met them because my ex claimed they were super racist since the grandpa was a Vietnam war vet (I\'m SE asian). Turns out, you can\'t be racist when you\'re dead!\n\nWe ended the call on a positive note, with his sister saying that it was a lot to take in. She said she felt bad as the girl he was cheating on me with was one of her friends. She had introduced them to each other sometime last year when my ex was apparently unhappy with our relationship. They hit it off and he was supposed to break it off with me. I guess he never had the balls to do so. She was also confused as to why he was on tinder as he was in a relationship with her friend. I sent her all the tinder receipts after hanging up.\n\nLater in the night, I received an email from the ex. To sum it up: yes, he asked me to come to the apartment to talk it out. No, he did not apologize for anything. He ended the email with \"I love you\". As far as I know, he doesn\'t know where I am. I also don\'t believe he knows where my friend lives as she just moved and he hasn\'t been here yet. He also doesn\'t seem like that type of person, but I guess I didn\'t really know him after all. We\'ll keep locks ready and bats near the door.\n\nIt\'s been so helpful just writing out everything that\'s happened so far, but all of your advice, support, and guidance in this situation has made me feel empowered me to leave. At times, I just wanted to stop packing and hope that when he came home, everything would go back to normal and the text would just be a distant memory. Your words of encouragement have really helped me follow through and leave. Nothing good would have come from staying. Thank you all again.\n\nEDIT: just added a link in the beginning to the original post\n\nEDIT 2: Sorry, I was unclear about the timeline. The parents and sister called me about 2 hours after he landed. I assume it was because he got home realized the person paying half his rent will no longer be doing so and reached out to his family. The dog poop may have contributed to the heightened emotions.\n\n***Some of OOP\'s Comments:*** \n\n**anongrl314159:** I took all the spices when I left, not because I could readily use them but because fuck that guy. Didn’t even leave salt n pepper\n\n&gt;**OOP:** I think I took like $300 of spices, oils, sauces, and just everyday cooking stuff. Thank you for this!!!!! \n\n**Maleficent-Leek2943:** But whatever he really hates, leave that behind.\n\nIf he’s ever expressed a dislike of celery salt or Worcester sauce, that needs to be the only thing left in the cupboard. Because fuck that guy.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** The dried rosemary was left behind. It’s his least favorite flavor. Subtle and incredible. Thank you! Haha \n\n**Obvious\\_Fox\\_1886:** logging out doesn\'t change your passwords. If he happens to know them ..he can just log back in or go change them himself.\n\n&gt;**OOP:** Good point. The passwords will be changed ASAP. \n\n*To a* [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obsrui/comment/nkiiwju/?context=3) *calling everything fake:* \n\nIf you don\'t believe that I did what I said I did, that\'s on you. A lot of it was sending emails and doing stuff online besides physically moving everything (which I did with the help of 3 friends) and putting poop in a picture frame.\n\nAs for not knowing his grandparents, it\'s not super relevant to the post why we\'re not close but it was because the first 5 years of our relationship, they were no contact. The last 2 years is when they\'ve reconciled (probably when his grandparents actually died). Why haven\'t I gotten to know them better since then? Two reasons: distance and racism.\n\n1. Though we\'re both from the same midwest hometown, his family still lives there. Mine moved away to SoCal where we live now. To get there, it\'s 7 hours at the airport with the layover + 2 hour drive to get to their house.\n2. If I liked them, the travel time wouldn\'t be the problem, but his family is racist. I\'m SE asian and they\'re old white folks. Since I\'ve met them, they repeatedly mispronounce my name, call me slurs as a joke, and sometimes pretend I don\'t speak English. The last time we had dinner was over a year ago and the main joke of the night was how I was a CCP agent honeypotting their son. I wasn\'t laughing.\n\nWe have each other\'s phone numbers for emergencies, but I\'m not chomping at the bit to be \"reaching out to chat just because\". I wasn\'t going to \"mend any bridges or whatever\" because I\'m not going to change how I look or where my parents are from anytime soon.\n\nAs for why the sister called? Mr Cheaterpants was mad the woman he cheated on would no longer be paying half the rent and I guess his sister took it personally. I don\'t really care. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n*OOP clarifies the timeline again:* \n\n&gt;We were together for 7 years. The first year and a half we were good friends that liked each other but didn\'t act on it/were bad at communicating feelings. As far as I know, we weren\'t seeing other people either (but who knows lol). We began to include it in our overall time together because it seemed right at the time. It\'s stupid to think of now. Sorry it made you doubt whether this was real.  \nAnd I already addressed your comment about his grandparents here.  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/1obsrui/comment/nkiiwju/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obsrui/comment/nkiiwju/?context=3)  \nAnd yeah, I was able to do it all in less than a day. I got 3 of my friends to move stuff out of a 500 sq ft apartment so it\'s not like I had much to move. And not that I have everything completely finished (I\'m still waiting to hear back on HR stuff and bank stuff) but do you guys really think sending out emails and changing passwords and making appointments is that hard? because that\'s like 8 of the 13 things were done online in the middle of the night. And the poop prank took maybe 10 minutes. And I slept maybe an hour on the drive home from the county office. So yeah, I had a lot of time. idk.  \nAnd if you think it\'s still fake because I keep replying to people, I\'m just answering these questions cuz I\'m trying to distract myself from falling into an emotional pit of despair.\n\n*To a longer* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obsrui/comment/nkipz78/?context=3)*:*\n\n&gt;Thanks for saying this. Now that things are starting to settle down, I can feel a lot of sadness start creep in. Maybe its for him, but I know it\'s partially for the future I had seen for myself for so long. Now, I feel like I don\'t know what direction \"forward\" is and I feel a bit lost. Someone had suggested counseling/therapy and before this adrenaline fully leaves I\'ll try to schedule that because I\'m sure it\'ll help.  \nI suppose the good thing about not having to plan for a wedding anymore is that I have more money for lady gaga tickets haha.  \nThank you so much for the kind words and warning of whats to come. I appreciate it :)\n\n***Editor\'s note:*** *There ended up being a sweet exchange* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obsrui/comment/nkj5dpf/?context=3)*, where OOP and someone accusing her of lying had a nice exchange.*', 'LucyAriaRose', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oh4ssh/my_27f_boyfriend_29m_of_7_years_cheated_on_me_im/', 6388, 432, '2025-10-27 04:00:03', '2025-11-08 01:36:52');

This puts retail investors at a significant disadvantage as they cannot compete on the same level as high-frequency traders who have access to advanced technology and vast resources.\n\nWe call on regulators to investigate these allegations thoroughly and take appropriate action to protect the interests of investors and ensure the integrity of the stock market. Join us in calling for a ban on Citadel Securities and other high-frequency trading firms who exploit market power and technology to gain an unfair advantage.\n\n**Accounting fraud**\n\nCitadel, the parent organization, has a plethora of subsidiaries that engage in the purchasing and vending of US treasuries amongst themselves, thus resulting in a perplexing transaction loop. Upon scrutiny of each subsidiary\'s accounting practices, there is a significant lack of transparency in the disclosure of pertinent information. To perpetuate the illusion of financial coverage, both the parent and affiliate companies are concealing their losses, a fraudulent scheme that has persisted for an extended period.\n\nDespite negligible fines issued by the regulatory authority, FINRA, Citadel has continued its dubious operations with impunity. The organization is willing to pay exorbitant settlement fees while reaping substantial profits. Over time, Citadel has emerged as a preeminent market maker on Wall Street, with confidential sources revealing that Goldman executives view Citadel as the most significant threat to their trading business. Furthermore, nine industry brokers, including Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Ally Invest Securities, First Trade, and TradeStation, rely on Citadel as their order flow source.\n\nAlthough these brokers do not exclusively depend on Citadel, it is worth noting that Citadel is responsible for a considerable portion of the market\'s activity.\n\n*In the year 2021, Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel, successfully evaded the calamitous effects of the \"meme stock\" scandal by implementing astute tactics in lobbying. The day before the trading halts, Citadel and Robinhood were accused of colluding to manipulate the market, leading to widespread controversy.\nDespite this scandalous event, Griffin emerged before the House Financial Services Committee on February 18 to justify his actions. Interestingly, it was subsequently disclosed that he had made direct contributions to four committee members: French Hill, Andy Barr, Ann Wagner, and Bill Huizenga, all of whom belong to the Republican party. These actions have raised pertinent inquiries regarding the authenticity of the political process and the sway of affluent personalities over it.*\n\n**The Ken Griffin Perjury**\n\nAmid claims of Ken Griffin\'s dishonesty, a commotion has arisen amongst retail investors on social media, with numerous individuals alleging he has told a significant falsehood. The magnitude of this purported deceit has captured the attention of multitudes, yet the inquiry that remains is whether those in governmental authority will take action regarding these assertions.\n\nRegrettably, past events indicate that such action is unlikely, as those in positions of power typically react only when confronted with an insurmountable public outcry or when they can attribute blame to others. Despite the severity of the charges leveled against Griffin, he has yet to confront any charges, a reality that numerous individuals ascribe to his supposed tendency to offer contributions to politicians in exchange for their silence.\n\n**A cursory examination of his political contributions corroborates this theory.**\n\n GRIFFIN, KENNETH C ,CHICAGO, IL, $2,000,000, October 28, 2020, Senate Leadership Fund\nGRIFFIN, KENNETH C, CHICAGO, IL ,$5,000,000, October 14, 2020,Senate Leadership Fund\nGRIFFIN, KENNETH C,CHICAGO, IL,$5,000,000,September 3, 2020,Senate Leadership Fund\nGRIFFIN, KENNETH C, CHICAGO, IL, $10,000,000, November 12, 2020, Senate Leadership Fund\nGRIFFIN, KENNETH C, CHICAGO, IL, $15,000,000, September 23, 2020, Senate Leadership Fund\n\nThe customary strategy of the traditional media and government seems to be \"let\'s not say anything, the news cycle will change in a few days and the general public have short memories, it will shortly dissipate.\" Nevertheless, numerous individuals have already been contacting and writing to their elected officials to let them know that they are cognizant and that they will not overlook it, as this might be one of the most momentous stories in the entire memestock saga so far, since the evidence indicates that Ken Griffin committed perjury.\n\nOn January 28, 2021, several brokers, including Robinhood, disabled the \"buy\" button, prohibiting retail investors from purchasing stocks. Essentially, traders could close their positions but could not open new long positions. All of this took place while hedge funds were increasing their shorts to attack the price.\n\nBehind closed doors, conversations were occurring between Citadel and Robinhood, and the accusation is that they lied about it, not only to retail investors but also to the Government House Committee on Financial Services while under oath. These documents are attempting to demonstrate the collusion that they claim never occurred, in reality, did take place.\nDuring the now-famous \'GameStop\' hearing by the US House Financial Committee in February 2021, Rep Juan Vargus (California) inquired whether Griffin or anyone from his company (Citadel) had plotted or done anything to promote the restriction of buying shares in GameStop. Griffin replied with an unequivocal no.\n\n*However, documents leaked by Robinhood insiders appear to contradict that statement. And if these are validated, it is evident..Ken Griffin lied under oath, which is a federal crime carrying a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and huge fines.*\n\n**Citadel and Robinhood Collusion**\n\nA legal document was lodged in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida as part of a class action lawsuit against various brokerages, including Robinhood, and market makers, including Citadel Securities. The complaint illuminates conversations that transpired within Robinhood on January 27th, which was one of the days trading of GameStop was halted by numerous brokerages. It also references the conversations that occurred between Robinhood and Citadel Securities.\n\nAs stated in the lawsuit, on January 27, \"Citadel Securities and Robinhood\'s top-level executives engaged in multiple communications that indicate that Citadel applied pressure on Robinhood.\" In Slack, Robinhood COO Gretchen Howard purportedly notified CEO Vlad Tenev that she, along with other Robinhood executives, including Jim Swartwout, would be on a call with Citadel Securities at 5 PM.\n\nLater on the same day, Robinhood Securities President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Swartwoth conveyed in an internal chat that \"you wouldn\'t believe the convo we had with Citadel, total mess.\"\n\nThe complaint alleges that later that night, a call was arranged between Tenev and a redacted person at Citadel Securities. The lawsuit notes that Swartwout later expressed, \"I have to say I am beyond disappointed in how this went down. It’s difficult to have a partnership when these kinds of things go down this way.\"\n\nThe accusations were consolidated in a hashtag aimed at Citadel CEO Ken Griffin: #KenGriffinLied, which gained traction Monday afternoon when Citadel Securities asserted that it \"did not ask\" Robinhood or any firm to limit or restrict trading activity on January 27th.\n\nCitadel Securities went on to claim that it was \"the only major market maker during this time that provided continuous liquidity every minute of every trading day.\" Another tweet stated that Ken Griffin and Vlad Tenev \"have NEVER met or spoken.\" The firm also tweeted a video clip of Griffin telling Congress that he did not instruct Robinhood to restrict trading, adding that he said so \"truthfully.\"\n\nIn two instances in the lawsuit, it is mentioned that Tenev purportedly requested to speak with Griffin, specifically because the two had never met, \"not specific to this crazy issue.\" The lawsuit does not indicate whether this meeting took place. In any case, Citadel Securities\'s tweets and this lawsuit document have breathed new life into a slew of conspiracy theories that have surfaced here and there over the last few months. It is worth noting that Robinhood disclosed in its S-1 filing for an Initial Public Offering that it is currently being scrutinized by state, local, and federal regulators for its role in the GameStop debacle and for halting trading.\n\n**US House Committee Financial Services Report on Robinhood and Citadel**\n\n**Key Finding #1**: Robinhood exhibited troubling business practices, inadequate risk management, and a culture that prioritized growth above stability during the Meme Stock Market Event\n\n**Key Finding #2**: Broker-dealers facing the greatest operational and liquidity concerns took the most expansive trading restrictions, although multiple broker-dealers introduced trading restrictions for a variety of risk management reasons during the Meme Stock Market Event.\n\n**Key Finding #3**: Most of the firms the Committee spoke to do not have explicit plans to change their policies for how they will meet their collateral requirements during extreme market volatility or adopt trading restrictions when market volatility may warrant their introduction.\n\n**Key Finding #4**: The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) waived $9.7 billion of collateral deposit requirements on January 28, 2021. The DTCC lacks detailed, written policies and procedures for waiver or modification of a \"disincentive” charge it calculates for brokers that are deemed to be undercapitalized and has regularly waived such charges during periods of acute volatility in the two years before the Meme Stock Market Event\n\n“Robinhood and Citadel Securities engaged in “blunt” negotiations the night before the trading restrictions to lower the PFOF rates Robinhood was charging Citadel Securities”\n“Like many other market makers, Citadel Securities grew increasingly concerned about the magnitude of the PFOF rebates it might be required to pay Robinhood associated with GME and somemoviestock given Robinhood’s unique PFOF rate structure in an unprecedented trading environment. Neither Citadel Securities employees nor Robinhood employees who spoke with the Committee could pinpoint precisely when the two firms began negotiating PFOF rebates on January 27, 2021. However, it is clear that by early in the evening of January 27, 2021, Citadel Securities employees communicated their concerns regarding PFOF rebates to Robinhood, particularly regarding the skyrocketing PFOF rebates being calculated for GME and somemoviestock.”\n\n“Before the market opened on the morning of January 28, 2021, at approximately 5:11 a.m. EST, Robinhood Securities, Robinhood’s clearing broker, received its daily automated notice from the NSCC setting out the firm’s daily collateral deposit requirement of approximately $3.7 billion. Given the fact that Robinhood already had approximately $700 million on deposit with the NSCC from the day before, this automated notice outlined a requirement for Robinhood Securities to deposit an additional $3 billion in its NSCC account by 10 a.m. EST”\n\n“As further detailed in the information that the NSCC provided to Robinhood through an automated portal, the largest components of the company’s collateral deposit requirement was a Value-at-Risk charge of approximately $1.3 billion, as well as an Excess Capital Premium charge of $2.2 billion, which Robinhood had not calculated. Robinhood calculated that of the $1.3 billion Value-at-Risk charge, approximately $850 million was attributable to somemoviestock and approximately $250 million was attributable to GME.”\n\n**Full report**\n\n**Citadel BAN in China**\n\n**Citadel Was Banned in China for 5 Years, Fined 97 Million, For allegedly Crashing the Mainland Metal Market With Illegal Short Selling.**\n\nIn 2015, Citadel Securities saw one of its accounts, managed by a Shanghai-based futures trading firm, barred from trading shares by securities regulators.

Fast forward to now, our son’s 15, 16 in a few months. Somehow we managed to go from “divorced and done” to actually being pretty good friends. Like, we choose to hang out sometimes, not only when it involves our son, and we get along better than ever. It’s worked out way better than I ever expected.\n\nMy ex has started seeing someone new. They\'ve been together for a little while now, but it\'s started to get more serious lately. I’ve met her, but don\'t know her well. My son is around her a lot more than I am and he likes her a lot. I hate that this bothers me. Like, I’m genuinely embarrassed by how irritated I felt hearing him say how nice she is, how fun she is, how she makes his dad happy. I plastered on a smile and said all the right things, but inside I was surprised by how jealous I felt.\n\nShe doesn’t like that my ex and I are friends. She’s fine with us communicating for our son, but the idea of us hanging out just because we want to is an absolute no in her book. And he’s started to pull back a little. He’s not saying it out loud, but I can tell he’s trying to “adjust” our dynamic to keep the peace in his new relationship. It stings.\n\nMonths ago we planned a special trip for our son’s 16th birthday, just the three of us. It was meant to be a shared memory, a kind of “family-ish” experience to mark a big milestone. It revolves around something my son is obsessed with, something my ex and I both enjoy too. But now the girlfriend’s coming. Despite having no interest in the activity.\n\nI found out from my son, not my ex, which made it even worse. I haven’t confronted him about it yet because I don’t know how to bring it up without sounding jealous or possessive. But I’m honestly upset. It feels like a sacred little space that used to belong to the three of us is slowly being taken over. And I feel helpless to stop it without looking like the “crazy ex-wife who can’t let go.”\n\nI didn’t expect to feel this jealous, and I really don’t want to come off as the “crazy ex.” But honestly, it feels like I’m losing way more than just a friendship here. I’ve worked really hard to be mature, supportive, and emotionally steady in this co-parenting journey.\n\nHow do I manage these feelings without making it weird or damaging the progress we’ve all made? And how do I set boundaries, if I even can, without turning this into a drama-filled mess?\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n**Some notable comments**\n\nBy u/sanguinare12\n\n&gt;In some sense, you\'ve been living in a bubble, where the idea of uninterrupted family persisted even through separation and divorce. It was only sustainable as long as nobody else was in the picture. Every situation is different, of course, but as a general thing, if relationships tolerate being amicable with exes for the purpose of shared children, tolerance tends to fade when those children aren\'t directly involved. The exclusive family unit isn\'t so exclusive any more. Time doesn\'t stand still, as much as you\'ve wanted it to.\n\n&gt;In situations where exes are so involved in each others\' lives, if there comes a point when one needs to pull back, there\'s often a second sting. There was a separation, a divorce, now the palpable reality of your ex getting serious with someone else. Ask yourself something. When is the best time to let go? Then? Now? Some time later when the weight of that reality becomes too much? If this brings more heartache no matter what, is it best to sever that imaginary cord now or wait until it stretches and stretches and snaps anyway?\n\nBy u/Smooth-Cheetah3436\n\n&gt;My husband and his ex wife weren’t necessarily friends, but before I came along she definitely was incredibly comfortable with their dynamic which was she basically got the emotional benefits of him as a husband (friendship, support, favors, coming over to her house to watch the kids) without having to deal with the relationship issues.\n\n&gt;It didn’t bother me really that much initially, I think it’s a green flag when you start dating a guy who doesn’t hate his ex, but once I started taking over that emotional space for him it seemed to really bend her out of shape. It’s all fine now, but there was definitely a power struggle, and my stepson would tell me how confused he was by his mom not seeming to like hearing how he liked me. He was little and didn’t really get it, since he thought I was nice.\n\n&gt;One thing that’s important to know is you’re not the one that needs to set boundaries here unless it’s around your kid. That’s totally reasonable, but only in regard to his wellbeing and safety. She is definitely the one that I guarantee you is struggling with the boundary setting. Imagine you’re dating a new guy, things are great but there’s some weird tie to the ex wife? It’s just not natural, and everyone can be friendly and support each other without being besties.\n\n&gt;I think you’ve been benefiting from this relationship in an unnatural way for a while, you both have, and there’s nothing wrong with grieving the situation at all. Take your time, until your emotional brain catches up with the logic. People move on and they have to make their partners their center, and it’s not a normal state of being to have your ex be your central friendship.\n\n&gt;It’s also important to note that your son is grown - she is definitely not coming in as a new mommy. Once my husband’s ex realized that I got the fact that her kids had a mom and I wasn’t interested in being anything other than a bonus adult in their life that cared about them and there to help facilitate a good co-parenting relationship when I could, things seemed to really fall into place.\n\n&gt;It’s normal to wish something good wouldn’t change, but this is something that definitely should change if it means you both get to meet and be with your people.\n\n**Downvoted comments of OP**\n\n&gt;I don\'t really think it makes sense for her to come on this trip. I think she\'s coming to chaperone us...because we\'re going to do something together with our son in the hotel room.\n___________________________________________________\n\n&gt;To provide a bit more background on the trip that might make it sound a little less weird:\n\n&gt;We didn\'t really intend to plan a trip for the purpose of going on a trip together, originally. A band we love is reuniting, and while we\'ve both seen them before (in fact, 20 years ago when we were a new couple), this is our son\'s first chance to see them. So, that\'s why the trip is happening...and it happens to be happening right around our son\'s birthday, so we\'re celebrating his birthday as part of the trip too.\n\n&gt;I genuinely have not been hoping this will spark something. Sure, the whole \"that was 20 years ago when we saw them together last time...\" has been screwing with my mind lately, and I still remember the date of the very first concert we went to together, but I think it\'s more of the focus on all the time that\'s passed and how it feels impossible for that to have been 2 decades ago rather than a focus on anything happening between us again.\n___________________________________________________\n\n&gt;I’m not going for the sake of reliving a memory we shared together. That\'s not the purpose of me going.\n\n&gt;She\'s coming along, but she\'s not coming to the concert. Guess she\'ll wait for us at the hotel or find something else to do in the meantime. There\'s no way she\'s getting my ticket. I\'ve loved this band for nearly 3 decades, before I even met my ex husband. She didn\'t even know who they were. Sorry, there\'s nothing that would make me offer her my ticket so they could all go have a great time together.\n___________________________________________________\n\n&gt;It must make sense to my ex-husband for the 3 of us to go together since he never even asked me if I wanted to, it was just naturally assumed from the beginning that \"we\'d\" be going and he bought the 3 of us tickets.\n\n___________________________________________________\n___________________________________________________\n\n\n**UPDATE: How do I (41F) deal with unexpected jealousy over my ex-husband\'s (42M) new girlfriend?**\n\n[Original Update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l93rv9/update_how_do_i_41f_deal_with_unexpected_jealousy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) - 12 June 2025\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nAt the beginning of June I asked for help with navigating these feelings I have regarding my son, my ex-husband, his new gf.\n\nThanks to everyone who replied. Even though I don\'t think I got a ton of specific, actionable advice (I got a lot of opinions and some solid advice), I definitely heard the recurring message loud and clear: therapy. Some of the comments were genuinely helpful in nudging me to start unpacking the root of what I’m actually feeling, so I appreciate that. Will I go to therapy right now? Honestly, probably not immediately, but we\'ll see.\n\nMost of all of the issues are things I just need to work through on my own, but I decided to just ask my ex-husband directly about the whole concert/birthday trip situation. I told him that our son had mentioned his girlfriend is now coming on the trip, and I needed clarity about what the plan was so I could figure out hotel stuff. I kept it as neutral and non-confrontational as possible. Truthfully, I don\'t want her to come and I\'m still sort of seething over her being there.\n\nHe admitted he hadn’t told me yet because he was still hoping she’d back out. He said he doesn’t want her to come, that it’s going to make things awkward, and that she kind of inserted herself into the plan and made it really clear she expected to be invited. He felt like he couldn’t say no without it hurting their relationship. He even said, “You think I want to go on a trip with both of you?”\n\nI suggested that maybe I should give her my concert ticket and buy a separate one so I wouldn’t have to sit near them and she wouldn\'t have to stay back at the hotel. Or maybe I should just plan to take my son to a completely different date on the tour all together since it was probably going to be very awkward for all of us, especially since he was now claiming he also didn\'t want her to come. I don\'t want to buy a ticket and sit separately. I don\'t want to plan a whole other trip to a different tour date. The thought makes me really mad, but I felt like the adult thing to do was to at least suggest it. Maybe I just wanted to see what his reaction would be. He immediately said there was no way I was giving my ticket to her or sitting separately. He said there\'s no way I\'m backing out or going to a different show, we\'ve been planning this for almost a year.\n\nWe did agree to cancel the shared hotel room and book separate rooms.\n\nI didn’t bring up the fact that his girlfriend isn’t thrilled with us spending time together. I feel like that’s something I just need to accept. Most people in new relationships with someone who has a close relationship with an ex would probably feel the same. It’s uncomfortable, but I get it, and I’ll deal with those feelings on my own.\n\nWhat’s hardest for me, though, is how much I still default to texting or talking to him. We used to talk daily, not just about things related to our son, but everything. He’s been my best friend for over 20 years. And before anyone jumps in and says I sound like the obsessive ex calling him that… he’s said the same about me.\n\nI haven’t had another best friend in a really long time. I had two close girlfriends years ago. Both of those friendships are long gone, not due to any sort of falling out but due to reasons I don\'t want to get into here. Since then, I’ve struggled to find another close female friend, someone I really connect with on that deeper level. I have friends, just nobody like that. I\'d say my ex-husband is the person I\'m most myself with and the person I\'m closest to in the world.\n\nSo yeah, my ex is still that person. And I’m starting to realize that while I don’t want him back romantically, I do still see him as mine. Not in a possessive, malicious way, but in that I think I’ve just never fully adjusted to him being someone with a life completely separate from mine. It’s like he’s still a character in my story, not somebody with an entire life of his own.\n\nI\'m also trying to take the advice of getting to know his girlfriend, while also trying not to over-involve myself in their lives. I don\'t want to become best friends with my ex-husband\'s girlfriend. That just sounds uncomfortable to me. I spent some time over at his house today and she was there. They don\'t live together (yet). He watched my dog for me overnight because I had a work event to go to. Well, it\'s my son\'s dog too, so the dog basically went over to his dad\'s with him. They have a splash pad for the dogs over there, so we were playing around with the dogs in the backyard. He starts asking me things like \"Top 5 albums of all time, go!\" Then we get into a friendly argument about our favorite albums, which evolved into top 5 guitarists, etc. and these are the things we get along about. I suddenly got the sense that she was not happy about our conversation since she doesn\'t seem to care about those things and couldn\'t participate in the conversation. I tried to steer the conversation in another direction so that she wasn\'t left out, but I\'m terrible at making small talk. I decided to make my excuses to politely leave at that point.\n\nSo now I guess it\'s just a matter of figuring out how you start emotionally detaching from someone who’s been my closest person for so long, especially when you still co-parent and have to interact regularly. How to I detach? I never detached after we got divorced, even though I thought I had.\n\n**Some notable comments**\n\nBy u/DueIndependence5527\n\n&gt;I read you first post and I can’t remember if I commented on it or not. After reading this update, a few thoughts as someone who hasn’t been in your position or the gf’s position:\n\n&gt;I’d be pissed if I was the gf and found out my boyfriend actually didn’t want me to go in this trip, was hoping he could talk me out of it, and had shared those feelings with his ex-wife that he’s way too close to.\n\n&gt;I think you’re either still in love with your ex-husband, have fallen back in love with him, or don’t love him romantically but still can’t stand the thought of anyone else but you having him. You either need to tell him how you feel or seek therapy to deal with your possessive feelings.\n\n&gt;It may partially apply to your ex as well. Why has it taken either of you so long to get back into a serious relationship with somebody new? His relationship won’t last long if he continues to prioritize you over his gf. Now whether that’s a good thing or bad thing depends on who you ask.\n\nBy u/UsuallyWrite2\n\n&gt;I remember your original post and commented on it.\n\n&gt;Having been in the GF’s shoes to some extent, it really does feel like the ex wife is “peeing on things” to mark territory when they bring up old memories or make comments like “look what beautiful kids we made” or whatever.\n\n&gt;Even if you’re not marking territory on purpose, it can come off that way. Like GF (or in my case, second wife) is just a third wheel and sister wife.\n\n&gt;I think that this is ultimately an ex husband issue with his boundaries though. If he’s saying he didn’t want her to come, why did he let her? Because he’s conflict averse.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, I think that at some point you two have to actually act divorced and stop planning “family time”. There are going to be holidays and graduations and maybe weddings in your not so far future and you just can’t keep doing them together. Not without the GF/new wife. It’s not kind and it’s not healthy.\n\n&gt;My (ex) husband used to do Xmas morning with his ex wife and the kids for example the first few years we were together and I wasn’t invited. Can you imagine how that felt? We lived together but I was to make myself scarce or he would go to her house if it was her holiday. The kids would even open gifts from me with their mom and dad without me there and that hurt.\n\n&gt;I don’t know what it’s like to be on your end. But I think your ex husband needs to pick a lane here.\n\n&gt;And frankly, the way you see him as your best friend makes me wonder why you two divorced. If you’re that tied to each other, why didn’t you each put in the effort to stay together? (Different topic but still…)\n\n&gt;I really feel like you need to find another outlet and start keeping the chats to kids only because you DO need a good friend but he is being inappropriate being that to you.\n\n___________________________________________________\n___________________________________________________\n\nNEW UPDATE\n\n**I’m secretly glad I stirred the pot with my ex husband, even though I know I shouldn\'t be**\n\n[New Update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lsrzw3/im_secretly_glad_i_stirred_the_pot_with_my_ex/?share_id=8Eitfoy3C_QUy5UXn-Nvi&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1) - Jul 06, 2025\n___________________________________________________\n\nI’ve posted before in the relationships subreddit about feeling unexpectedly jealous over my ex-husband’s new girlfriend, mostly in relation to our teenage son and a special trip we’d planned. This isn’t an advice post. I’m not here for strategies. I\'m just posting an update I guess, after receiving a lot of messages saying that I\'m delusional, that I\'m still in love with him, etc.\n\nMy ex-husband and I divorced eight years ago. Our son is about to turn 16. Somewhere along the way, we stopped being just co-parents and started being actual friends. I consider him my best friend, I guess. The kind who still text dumb memes at midnight. We know everything about each other. We haven’t been “together” in a long time, but I guess I never really figured out how to detach. Or how stop seeing him as my person.\n\nAnd now there’s someone new...his girlfriend. We\'ve both dated since we divorced. I\'ve never been in a super serious relationship since then, mainly because I haven\'t wanted to be. I like having my own space. I also struggle to find anyone that I have as much chemistry with. But I think with the chemistry came frequent explosions between us. I\'d say this is the most serious partner either of us has had since we divorced. She doesn’t love how close we are. I get it. I\'d probably feel the same if I were her. She\'s not mean or dramatic. If anything, she’s been… careful.\n\nSo as I mentioned in my previous posts, my ex-husband and I are taking our son to see Oasis for his 16th birthday. His birthday falls right around the show we\'re going to. We\'re in this US, so this doesn\'t happen for us until end of the summer. I\'ve been in love with Oasis since I was a teenager. My husband is a big fan too. We are huge music fans, like nerd level and very obsessive over all of it and that\'s the main thing we bonded over and had in common. My son is obsessed with music too and he loves Oasis - he\'s probably even more excited than we are, but we\'ve seen them live several times already. The new girlfriend who has no interest in any of this stuff has invited herself along on the trip, and I\'ve not accepted that it\'s happening. I\'m not happy about it because I feel like I won\'t be able to be completely myself and she\'ll be watching me the whole time, but I\'ve accepted it and am moving on.\n\nShe actually texted me recently since I last posted about this whole situation here. It wasn’t hostile. It was polite, maybe even kind, in a guarded sort of way. She said she just wanted to clear the air, that she hopes things can be comfortable between all of us. She asked for a little more space, especially when we’re together.\n\nSo things were fine, I guess. II was doing my best to be respectful and to pull back some. I’ve been trying so hard not to reach out to him. Even though he’s still the first person I want to text when something funny happens, or something awful, or when I just need to share a moment. I’m unlearning the reflex. I\'m sad about it, but I understand this needs to happen. I\'m too dependent on him. But he keeps texting me. It\'s never anything that crosses the line. Strictly platonic stuff. But still, it makes me feel like the bad guy.\n\nOasis played their first gig in 16 years. Our son was at his dad’s, and he texted me saying, “They’re livestreaming it.” So I turned it on. I was texting both my son and my ex-husband about it - we have a group chat. Sending videos, yelling about the setlist, making stupid jokes. It felt like joy. I felt 17 again.\n\nI got so caught up in it that I went online and spent several hundred dollars on Oasis merch for me and my son. I didn’t even think about it. It just felt good. I didn\'t buy anything for my ex husband as that\'d be inappropriate now, obviously.\n\nApparently, while this was happening, his girlfriend had invited him to a 4th of July party. He said no - he wanted to stay home and watch the concert stream. We both abhor fireworks anyway. She asked who he was texting for hours. He didn’t answer. So she grabbed his phone, saw it was me, and threw it across the room. Then she left.\n\nI didn’t see it. I didn’t hear it. But my son did, which is how I learned about it.\n\nThat’s what I keep circling back to - our son. He’s the reason I’ve kept this dynamic so healthy for so long. He\'s also the reason we got divorced. It wasn\'t his fault we divorced, but we decided to get divorced for his sake, because being around our fights and arguments was really bad for him. He’s the reason I’ve bitten my tongue more times than I can count. I don’t want him caught up in any of this adult drama. He deserves better than that.\n\nI’ve also started looking at other shows and flights so that if I can get tickets to other Oasis dates, my son and I can go just the two of us, ex-husband not invited. But we’ll still go to the one planned together.\n\nThe truth is that I know I should probably be bad for being part of whatever caused her to throw his phone and storm out of the house, but secretly it made me kind of happy. I probably would have been ecstatic about it had I not been reminded about how I don\'t want my son dealing with all of us acting like toddlers. I\'ve even thought about reaching out to her to try to explain that we weren\'t having any sort of inappropriate conversation, but I can\'t bring myself to do it. I guess there\'s still this part of me that wants to \"win,\" but win what?\n___________________________________________________\n\nComments from Redditors\n\nu/gdude0000\n\n&gt;I\'ve read both your posts and seriously, there is being friendly and on good terms to be a good coparent and then there is emotionally enmeshing yourself with your ex.

No.\n\nu/JarvanIVPrez\n\n&gt;Reminder that your son is not an adult yet and your little game you’re playing here with your ex that you definitely still love is absolutely going to have an immense effect on him even at that age. You read as incredibly self centered and immature, and you clearly care more about your own ego and personal feelings toward your ex than you do your son, or you’d be able to put your head away from being an actual homewrecker and finally move on.

She doesn\'t have any knowledge of or connection to the industry I used to work in. She is a paramedic so she works different shifts and does not know I stream at times when she is not home. Her salary is enough to cover our bills although things will be a bit tighter until I starting making money on my stream.\n\nI\'m not going to tell anyone until I\'m bringing in enough money that I can do it full time. I have never been happier and not stressed as I am now. It\'s easy for me to lock myself in my home office and say I\'m networking and job hunting when I\'m really streaming if my wife and/or my 3 year old is home.

(424, 'reddit', '1o6fb2q', 'BF6 Maps are the core problem, maps suck', 'The single biggest issue with *BF6* isn’t the gunplay, or graphics — it’s the **maps**. They’re chaotic in all the wrong ways and structurally prevent the game from feeling like Battlefield.  To really fix this mess, the MAPS are the root cause.   The rest can be fixed, like balancing.\n\nOn one map alone, I counted four different routes running parallel to the same left-side street. That’s not counting the center path through buildings (which has endless flank points) or the right side. There’s *no way* to establish a defensible line — too many intersecting paths, too much clutter, zero flow.\n\nOlder Battlefield maps understood **macro design principles**:\n\n* Defined lanes with intentional choke points.\n* A sense of battle flow that encouraged frontlines and tactical repositioning.\n* Open sightlines balanced by cover that had purpose — not random props scattered for “immersion.”\n\nNow, it feels like DICE designs maps around constant engagement metrics instead of strategy. The result:\n\n* You get shot in the back constantly.\n* Squads can’t anchor or coordinate because every route is a flank.\n* Vehicles feel boxed in by dense urban geometry.\n* The chaos is visual, not tactical — everything is cluttered, noisy, and fatiguing.\n\nBF used to breathe — it had SPACE for movement, rhythm, and map control. *BF6* is suffocating. It’s built for highlight reels, not battlefield flow.  You knew when to hold, or push.\n\nIf DICE wants to fix this, it’s not about adding new gadgets or specialists — it’s about **returning to readable, tactical map layouts** that reward coordination and area control. Bring back intentional design, not just cinematic spectacle. **Battlefield has turned into a spectacle designed for YouTube shorts — nonstop explosions, chaos, and flashy moments made to look good in clips instead of play well in matches.** It’s all surface-level hype, and in chasing that, the game’s completely lost the tactical, team-oriented core that made Battlefield special.\n\nEven the sound design feels disconnected. There’s no sense of impact or spatial awareness — I literally had a tank rolling down the street behind me and couldn’t hear it. Grenades don’t feel concussive, explosions  — there’s no weight or connection, it\'s all just noise.\n\nSeine Crossing, Grand Bazaar, Strike and Kirkland, Firestorm and my all time fav Metro, all were great maps. BF6 is a mid BF at best and time will show you it\'s place.\n\n\\*EDIT\\*  \nI didn\'t edit anything from the body.  \nAfter reading through a ton of reviews and community feedback,  the problem is structural. The maps need to be widened and lengthened so fights have room to breathe, and the flank routes should be streamlined instead of scattered. Make us earn each flag, not just run around wildly. The flow should be focused, where you could actually hold ground and build a frontline.\n\nRight now, it’s constant yo-yo gameplay: capture, get flanked, run back to recapture, repeat. The pacing never settles, and there’s no rhythm or strategy to positioning, push or holds. The maps need space, focus, and some breathing room. Like literally elongate a street. Engagement zones are short lived; you fight, win, and immediately move on because there’s no natural containment or choke to sustain the battle.\n\nAnother topic I\'m seeing, the overabundance of micro-interiors with no clear purpose or flow. It eliminates the tactical layer, you can’t “hold” an area, only pass through it.  Because most rooms have 3 or 4 doors, the interiors are flank meat grinders, just endless ways to get shot from every direction. Some of the staircases have nor purpose or dead ends.  It just kills the flow.\n\n\\-Hit Reg, resolution with anything in distance, UI, people are saying it\'s hard to see enemy, spotting, EA server lag, bullet spread/bloom, TTK, minimap, unpolished gunplay; all compound the problem..\n\nSo it’s just Battle, and no field.  \nMaps are supposed to be the foundation to Battlefield.', 'Realistic-Pea-8278', 'Battlefield', 'https://reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o6fb2q/bf6_maps_are_the_core_problem_maps_suck/', 1711, 789, '2025-10-14 13:19:29', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),
(425, 'reddit', '1oc8k9f', 'Stella Sora, more like Stella Soar in the dumpster. 24h review', 'So... Yostar messed up, big time. One of the gacha darlings expected to release came out and it flopped harder than a chocolate soufflè.   \nLet\'s get to business with the usual rubric:\n\n**Rerolling**  \nQuite fast, very easy, big \"error margin\" per reroll given the built-in reroll start and the launch rewards (20+ limited pulls I believe.)\n\n**The Gacha and Pulls Income**  \nThis is bad... Pull currency revenue is about the same as hoyo games, with 5-10 little gems at a time.  \n...Issue? The pulls cost 300 and not 150/160. This is a slap in the face after showing in the beta that pulls were 150 each. This is compounded by paid packs not accomodating this price increase, leading to OUTRAGEOUS demands such as 4 dollars per single pull or 50 dollars barely getting you 25 pulls. Or whales doing the math and finding out you need 400dollars to guarantee one character without signature.  \nBut let\'s get to that gacha, which also stinks to high heaven. The gacha is 2% with 50/50, guaranteed at 120.   \nIn order:  \n\\-There is no pity giving you extra 5\\*s if you fail along the way. You just get the character at 120.  \n\\-If you fail the 50/50, there is no guaranteed next 50/50 is a win. I have lost 4 50/50s in a row.  \n\\-The rates description is VERY confusing, on one side saying you get the rate-up at 120 and right after saying you have a guaranteed within 160 rolls.  \n\\-Every 10pulls, you get 1 free single roll on the \"weapon banner\"  \nAbysmal is not even remotely close to describe this mess. We will talk more about how much you are rewarded when clearing content later.\n\n**Character pool**  \nThere are currently 8 5\\* and 16 4\\*. But it might as well be only 8 5\\* characters. The divide in damage between the two is SO BIG it makes 4\\* absolutely worthless to run as main dps, even when running mono-element. More in the combat section.\n\n**Character building**  \nSigh.... have we learned NOTHING from Ash Echoes complaints??? To build the characters, the game makes you play a \"\"\"roguelike\"\"\" mode (yes I\'m putting it in brackets since so far there are no branching paths you can choose to explore when clearing rooms and it\'s basically a long forced corridor) and then take a snapshot recording of your build at the end. You then combine this data with your team current level and skill level and go clear every other content. For HSR players, imagine if you had to run Simulated Universe over and over to record clears and then having to use those clears to do any content in the game.  \nFor the build itself, you have a main dps you control and two support units that you can call to use their skills or ultimates. Every character can pick a variety of Potentials personalised to them like Boons. Think like buffs from HI3 Elysian realms except you also pick buffs for the 2 support units.  \nYou also get \"records\", aka weapons, that give you substats and a passive to trigger IF you get enough musical notes during your roguelike run. (Think Equations from HSR SU)  \nThe game does have a relic system but nobody has been able to access it because... well we\'ll see in the progression section why.  \nOne last big elephant to address: dupes. For 4\\* characters, you need TWO dupes to get 1 Talent level (Eidolon). This is kind of a deaf point since, as I already adressed, 4\\* characters are worthless as main dps but still. Players are having lots of problems especially when they would like to max their favorite character. This issue is only linked to 4\\* as 5\\* give the full amount of fragments needed to fully unlock a talent.\n\n**Progression**  \n***RUN***.  \nThis is, by far, the most awful possible thing ever.   \nSo, every single system in-game is locked behind Account level. Account levelling is done by doing dailies and spending stamina....  \nRemember day1 HSR issues of having content locked behind level and people just not having the stamina to get over that wall? Yeah, this is that but 10 times worse. You get a \"mini\" wall at level 10 to 11  \nAnd then the Dead Sea from 11 to 13-15 (next unlock point). Only people who have bought the battlepass have currently reached level 15. The stamina recharge rate and initial stamina items are ridiculously low, leading to f2ps being sitting ducks for a few days.  \nThis wouldn\'t be a problem if players were able to properly level up their characters in the meanwhile....  \n...oh boi. The game has boxes to pick and choose ascension materials for character level cap, skill level, record level etc. As soon as you run out of those boxes, you are in no man land.  \nEvery material quest cost 30 stamina. At difficulty 4 (unlocked at level 11) you get 6 common materials and the chance to drop 1 Rare material. You can trade 3 commons for 1 rare.  \n...you need 10 commons... AND 15 RARES to go from level 30 to 40 on a single character. In the worst case (which is very very unlikely), you would need to spend 270 stamina for a single level uncap. You get 1 stamina point every 6 minutes, do the math. In worst case scenario (which again, unlikely), you would need 1620 minutes to get a single low-level uncap... OR TWENTYSEVEN HOURS. Assuming you get a 1 drop every run aka best case, you will still need 7 runs, or 210 stamina, or 1260 minutes or 21 hours.   \nThis is plainly ridiculous. Yes, the game showers you at the start in material boxes but those are not even enough to clear the required uncapped characters number for the \"beginner\" quests.  \nSkill levels go even worse. At difficulty 3, you get 7 common drops and chance at 1 rare drop. Skill costs are 6&gt;12&gt;24&gt;38 for commons and 0&gt;0&gt;3&gt;8 for rare materials. There are 4 skills per character, albeit you will only have to level 3 for a character you use as main dps and 2 for supports. Still, let\'s assume a main dps. You will need to level up 3 skills till level 4, 126 commons and 9 rares. Just to reach the target common mats needed, you will have to run 18 times. And that\'s without accounting for Rare drops. So yea... ABSOLUTELY HORRID.  \nAlso no, the game has no \"converting down\" system.   \nAccount level-wise, the exp gates needed are also high af  leading to players being stuck in limbo with nothing to do.  \nJust... no.\n\n**Combat system**  \nThe combat is bird-eye view with auto-shooting mechanics. It\'s basically Vampire Survivors but you also get to activate skills and ultimates.   \nEnemies are GIANT Hp-sponges, and healers are basically useless at the current point because even without dodging you are never in danger. AND if you slot in an healer, you are losing SUBSTANTIAL damage on the overall.  \nNow, I did want to talk about why 4\\*s are useless. As I already said, you only actively control one character as a main dps. The game heavily favors running mono-elemental teams due to how Records passives work. Even then, the damage numbers from 4\\*s are abysmal. One of the content, arena, has elemental arenas where you need to run a record with a main dps of a certain element.  \n...well. In the water arena, I first tried a mono-water team with all 4\\*s. I failed miserably.  \nI then made a record with the same dps and 2 5\\*s supports (Minova and Mistique for those interested). Well? Would you look at that, I\'m suddenly clearing everything. HOWEVER, more funnily enough, the supports are doing 5x the damage of my main 4\\* dps.  \nThis is an issue that\'s gonna be curved in time with bigger character pools yada yada but the fact the character I, the player, I\'m playing is dealing infinitely lower damage than the characters I activate with a button is soul-crushing.\n\n**Content**  \nWhat content??  \nHere\'s the list of content available to level 11 players and their \"rewards\":  \n  \n\\-Main story. Only 2 main chapters currently in game. 360 gems for the first, 480 for the second.  \n\\-Ascension (roguelike). 3 towers, 3 difficulties. 100 gems per difficulty cleared. You also get 5-10 gems for stuff, like collecting 10-20etc. different Boons for each individual character or unlocking archive notes by running them.  \n\\-Menace arena. (wave mode/element-check mode). 7 arenas, 6 element ones (2 per day rotate). 5 difficulties for the general one, 3 for the element ones. 200 gems per difficulty. Yes, clearing an entire 10 wave arena doesn\'t even give you a single pull.  \n\\-Cataclysm Survivor (Literally Vampire Survivor. Incredible naming Yostar). \\*Technically\\* All 7 difficulties unlocked but you most likely will only clear the first two at this point. 100 gems per difficulty+ some 5 gems every 15 cards of a certain combat style you collect in a run.  \n  \n\\-Basic trial (level up fodder). 3 difficulties. 50 gems per difficulty.  \n\\-Tier up trials (level uncap mats). 3 bosses, 4 difficulties. 50 gems per difficulty.  \n\\-Skill trial (skill materials). 3 bosses, 3 difficulties. 50 gems per difficulty.  \n  \nAnd that\'s about it. The 3 last modes need all 30 stamina to run. There is no launch event, no infinite roguelike mode, nothing. And the content that is there spits in your face with the rewards given, may it be first clear gems or level up materials.  \nYou do get 100 gems per level and 500gems every-time you clear a quest bundle to guide you through progression (beginner quests), but that\'s, again, stamina-gated. Heavily.\n\n**Monetization**  \nI already said most of the bad in the gacha section but lemme add more!  \nThe welkin is 5 dollars, 90 gems per day+600 from purchase, leading to 3300 gems vs 3000 gems on hsr/genshin... Problem is over there that\'s 18.75 pulls, here it\'s only 11. And if you are wondering, dailies only give 100 gems.  \nHowever the biggest insult has to be the battlepass, Ofc classic stuff like the normal track only gives perma-pulls, if you buy the normal pass you also get to pick one of several battlepass only weapons etc.  \n...the issue is the skin. If you pay 7 extra dollars, you get a special pfp and a character skin...  \n...well. Turns out it\'s not a skin but just a wallpaper. You heard me right, the paid skin doesn\'t change AT ALL the character 3d model. It\'s only a live2d wallpaper, with the extra insult that when inspecting it in the battlepass buyscreen it has a switch between 3d and 2d toggle and it just shows you the base model. Absolutely insane. Ridiculous.\n\n**Dramas**  \nWell, basically all of the above with CN/JP players rioting due to how bad EVERYTHING is but with a few small extras. Mainly, the fact that between beta and release the gacha cost was DOUBLED and rates were altered. Also some CC blatantly being sponsored and having to be very... \"mute\" about the situation and treading carefully. Yostar, on their end, made no comments about any of this despite the loud response. Also JP VAs later having a playthrough livestream to promote the game and everyone knowing it\'s gonna end horribly chat-side...\n\n**Conclusion**  \nSkip. Just don\'t. Just play more Blue Archive if you want \"that\" stuff. This is a pit of greed, lament, uninspired game mechanics and just... no.  \nYou want a new game? Go play CZN.   \nYou want a good game? All glory to Limbus Company.  \nThank you for the read\n\nEDIT:\nJust adding some extra stuff.\n1. Pity. You get a guaranteed at 120 on a single banner. That one doesn\'t carry over. After that, there s a guaranteed within 160 rolls that does carry over, I do not know if the 120 guaranteed cancels the 160 pity.\n2. Tech incompetence. Mainly, in the game you can invite some of the girls to hangout at dates.... the hangouts are copy pasted, nothing personalised. Also for whatever reason the gacha pull audio is separate from the game app audio and it messes up when muting game window.\n3. The livestream. As predicted, it\'s currently a mess. The chat is full of people both EN and JP demanding changes and moderators constantly deleting, muting and banning chatters.', 'gugali123', 'gachagaming', 'https://reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1oc8k9f/stella_sora_more_like_stella_soar_in_the_dumpster/', 1744, 684, '2025-10-21 09:42:48', '2025-11-08 01:36:52');

My boyfriend went to his our home state to see his family for the weekend. He\'s been going quite often this year, about once a month, saying it is because his grandparents are old and miss him. I thought nothing of it until this morning. I got a screenshot from a mutual friend of ours of my boyfriend\'s location on snapchat.\n\nHe was at his parents house but a girl\'s bitmoji was there as well. It wasn\'t his sister or mom and his parents (who weirdly also have snapchat) weren\'t home either. He didn\'t tell me he was going to be with anyone one else today. I tried to call him but he did not pick up. I looked on snapchat and his location was turned off.\n\nThe mutual friend says my boyfriend has told everyone at home we had broken up 4 months ago. He said my boyfriend was making him stay quiet about it because he was trying to find the right time to tell me. As far as his parents know, he\'s moving home once our lease is up. The reason our mutual friend told me was because he walked in on my boyfriend and the girl hooking up with each other this morning.\n\nI texted an old friend who lives in my hometown, and she immediately asked why my boyfriend was on tinder. We caught up and she sent me proof his photos on tinder and his bio. It hurt to see that photos I took of him were used. He had even covered my face in a photo we took together and said \"this could be you\".\n\nI had no idea his family thought we were broken up and that he was looking for other people to date. We even went to Italy a month ago celebrating our 7 year anniversary! I\'m so confused and I don\'t know what to do. I look around and everything in our apartment seems like a lie.\n\nThe soon to be ex texted me just now and he is on his flight back. He\'ll be back in about 5 hours. Obviously, he can find his own way to the apartment from the airport.\n\nI\'m shocked and numb, but my best friend is with me helping me pack up all my clothes. I\'m leaving and I\'m not leaving a trace of myself behind. Our dog is coming with me, and I\'ll be staying at my best friend\'s place for now.\n\nMy soon to be ex and I already have separate bank accounts, and our joint bank account does not have much in it right now. I make more than he does so he can keep it. I can\'t go to the leasing office because it\'s closed on Sundays, but I sent an email asking for early termination on the lease. We\'re registered as domestic partners, so I\'ve completed the termination form and will drive it up to the LA county office tomorrow. He is on my health insurance, and I\'ve sent the email to HR to kick him off ASAP.\n\nWe have several large photo albums together, and I\'m not sure what to do with those. Keeping them would be too difficult but I don\'t want him to have the satisfaction of having our photos. It\'s clear he uses our memories in a horrible way.\n\nIs there anything I\'m missing? I can\'t seem to think of anything and all my thoughts seem so jumbled. Nothing makes sense, but I know I can\'t stay. Any help to ghost a person this close to my heart would be appreciated.\n\n____\n\n\n&gt;# [**Update**](https://np.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obsrui/update_my_27f_boyfriend_29m_of_7_years_cheated_on/)\n*October 21, 2025, 1 day later*\n\nThank you everyone for all the solid advice.

As mentioned in the comments:\n\n* I logged myself out of our apple TV and xbox\n* I cancelled the wifi that I paid for and returned the modem to the carrier. \n* I took my payment information for utilities off our account. \n* I packed up all my sauces, spices, and cooking oils, and took note to only leave dried rosemary behind (he hates that shit).  \n* I printed out and framed the screenshot of his tinder profile and left it on the kitchen table. I closed a piece of dog poop into the frame as well. I\'ll keep the photo albums. He can have this. \n* I took a video of the entire apartment after packing up all my things. I left my keys in the mailbox to the leasing office and emailed the leasing office of my departure with the videos of what the apartment looked like prior to locking up. \n* I updated my address for the USPS, vet, hospital, school, work, and my dog\'s chip. \n* I talked to HR and am in the process of getting him off of my health insurance, changing the benefactor of my life insurance to my parents (if only I could name my dog), and emergency contact. \n* I\'m going to the bank to take myself off the joint bank account. Fortunately, I\'m not worried about my credit as all of our finances have stayed separate, but I\'m grateful to those who told me to freeze my credit.\n* I logged out of all devices for all streaming services, social media, and my work, personal, and school email. \n* I blocked him on all social media, chatrooms, and his phone number. \n* I made a doctor\'s appointment to get STD tested.\n* I\'m on my way to an appointment with the county office to terminate our domestic partnership.\n\nIt\'s been an incredibly busy 18 hours but I\'ve had a lot of help from my friends. I haven\'t been able to sleep either. As far as what happened since he arrived, here\'s what\'s up: \n\nI already blocked him before he landed. I received many texts and calls from his parents and sister that I did not see. Then, when I noticed his sister calling, I picked up. At first, the call was hostile. She accused me of being some crazy ex girlfriend that couldn\'t let her brother go. Funny, since I just packed up and left. She brought up that it had been \"4 months\" and that I needed to move on. I told her that the ex never approached me about breaking up and that 1 month ago, we celebrated our 7th anniversary and started to plan our wedding. I had no indication he even wanted to break up. \n\nWe reset a bit and she allowed me to tell her my side of the story. I told her he was somewhat distant this year, but he had blamed it on their grandparents being old and wanting to spend more time with them before they die. Turns out, their grandparents have been dead for 2 years. I never met them because my ex claimed they were super racist since the grandpa was a Vietnam war vet (I\'m SE asian). Turns out, you can\'t be racist when you\'re dead! \n\nWe ended the call on a positive note, with his sister saying that it was a lot to take in. She said she felt bad as the girl he was cheating on me with was one of her friends. She had introduced them to each other sometime last year when my ex was apparently unhappy with our relationship. They hit it off and he was supposed to break it off with me. I guess he never had the balls to do so. She was also confused as to why he was on tinder as he was in a relationship with her friend. I sent her all the tinder receipts after hanging up. \n\nLater in the night, I received an email from the ex. To sum it up: yes, he asked me to come to the apartment to talk it out. No, he did not apologize for anything. He ended the email with \"I love you\". As far as I know, he doesn\'t know where I am. I also don\'t believe he knows where my friend lives as she just moved and he hasn\'t been here yet. He also doesn\'t seem like that type of person, but I guess I didn\'t really know him after all. We\'ll keep locks ready and bats near the door. \n\nIt\'s been so helpful just writing out everything that\'s happened so far, but all of your advice, support, and guidance in this situation has made me feel empowered me to leave. At times, I just wanted to stop packing and hope that when he came home, everything would go back to normal and the text would just be a distant memory. Your words of encouragement have really helped me follow through and leave. Nothing good would have come from staying. Thank you all again. \n\nEDIT: Sorry, I was unclear about the timeline. The parents and sister called me about 2 hours after he landed. I assume it was because he got home realized the person paying half his rent will no longer be doing so and reached out to his family. The dog poop may have contributed to the heightened emotions. \n\n____\n\n&gt;# Comments by OOP:\n\nI was able to do it all in less than a day. I got 3 of my friends to move stuff out of a 500 sq ft apartment so it\'s not like I had much to move. And not that I have everything completely finished (I\'m still waiting to hear back on HR stuff and bank stuff) but do you guys really think sending out emails and changing passwords and making appointments is that hard? because that\'s like 8 of the 13 things were done online in the middle of the night. And the poop prank took maybe 10 minutes. And I slept maybe an hour on the drive home from the county office. So yeah, I had a lot of time. idk.\n\nAnd if you think it\'s still fake because I keep replying to people, I\'m just answering these questions cuz I\'m trying to distract myself from falling into an emotional pit of despair.\n\n____\n\nI think I took like $300 of spices, oils, sauces, and just everyday cooking stuff. \n\n____\n\nNow that things are starting to settle down, I can feel a lot of sadness start creep in. Maybe its for him, but I know it\'s partially for the future I had seen for myself for so long. Now, I feel like I don\'t know what direction \"forward\" is and I feel a bit lost. Someone had suggested counseling/therapy and before this adrenaline fully leaves I\'ll try to schedule that because I\'m sure it\'ll help.\n\nI suppose the good thing about not having to plan for a wedding anymore is that I have more money for lady gaga tickets haha.\n\n____\n\nHonestly? Shout out to my dog shitting at the perfect time to press it into the picture frame. He really was there when I needed him most.\n\n____\n\n*Editor\'s Note: OOP was reminded in the comments to not just log out of stuff, but to change the password, so he can\'t log back in.* \n_____\n\n*I\'m not the original poster*', 'Schattenspringer', 'BORUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/1oc7hb3/my_27f_boyfriend_29m_of_7_years_cheated_on_me_im/', 3405, 273, '2025-10-21 08:32:22', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

I was her Maid of Honor and I worked to the bone to make sure her wedding was a success. For the most part it did went well. My friend looked beautiful, the food was great, the flowers and decorations incredible. She was so happy and it made me feel proud I was part of the group that work to give her such an important day.\n\nAmy and I have been friends since we were in elementary school. We\'ve reached all our milestones since together, went to the same college, even live in the same neighborhood. She\'s the closest I have to a sister and even our parents joke we\'re reborn twins. Needless to say, Amy is one of the most important people in my life.\n\nAt the end of my Masters I met Danny(31M). He hired me as a tutor and after a few sessions asked me out. I had never dated someone younger, but he was very sweet and I liked him, so I said yes. We\'ve been together since. He had an older brother, Bobby (39M) who was introduced to Amy in a house party I hosted a few years later. The two were immediately taken with each other and they started to date. Eventually Bobby asked Amy to marry him.\n\nDuring the wedding preparation, Danny casually mentioned how it would be a cute idea to propose during his brother\'s wedding. Bobby agreed, but both Amy and I immediately shut it down. I told Danny I found that kind of thing tacky. A person\'s wedding is a special day for them and tainting it with stealing the attention was just wrong.\n\nAfter that they stopped talking about it, so we kept going with the preparations.\n\nAt the wedding reception, Bobby suddenly stopped the music to make an \'announcement\'. He said the day was very special as he was marrying the love of his life and kept singing praises to Amy. I thought it was a cute gesture so I just moved to sit on my chair to listen to the speech. Then Bobby said a sentence that made me dread what was coming: \'And now the day is more special thanks to my brother\'s announcement\'.\n\nSuddenly Danny was in front of me, kneeling with a box. Amy was in tears and ran out. I screamed at Danny, telling him he was a jerk and went after Amy. At first she was angry at me, think I was involved in it. So were the other bridesmaids. Thankfully one of the girls had seen me call out Danny and told the others about it. I told Amy I would never do this to her. We hugged and we all got out of the venue to Amy\'s suite. We found out later through the men\'s mother that Bobby gave Danny permission without speaking to Amy about it.\n\nI called Danny that same night to tell him we were through and I wanted him out of my apartment by the end of the week. I sent my mom to pick up my dog and parrot, just to make sure he didn\'t do anything to them or take them with him. He ended up taking my TV and game consoles (I had them since before he moved in), but his mother was nice enough to bring the consoles back. For all I care, he can keep the stupid TV.\n\nAmy is now trying to get her marriage annuled since she feels she can\'t trust Bobby. The boys\' mother has been nothing but a saint to us. She even paid back to Amy the money she spent on the wedding and told her to use the honeymoon with one of her friends. So Amy and I are now packing to go to Australia. She and Bobby had postpone it for a month so they could get a whole month of vacation. I am a freelancer that works from home, so I\'ll just take my laptop.\n\nSince this whole fiasco, Danny has been blowing up my phone. Some of his friends have joined in this to, claiming I\'m an asshole for throwing out a ten years relationship over a mistake. That he only wanted to make a cute gesture to prove how much he loves me. Except the cute gesture was taking over my bestfriend\'s wedding after I had said how much I dislike that kind of stuff.\n\nStill, a part of me feels I\'m overreacting. So reddit, am I the asshole in this?\n\nTo the people PMing me to call me names or insult me, have the balls to post in public or just leave me alone. I have no interest in cowards that hurl insults in private. Also for the record: Even if it had been the perfect proposal, for my own reason I would have refused to marry. We were not in marriage talks. Far from it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TOP/RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**u/MisaOEB** (downvoted)\n&gt;Honestly men don’t see that as such a big deal and when their mum ok’d it they probably thought it would be fine in the moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;However I get that you think it’s a big deal.\n&gt;\n&gt;My main problem here is the lack of communication. No couple or marriage is perfect. You went from he did a dumb thing to we’re done. Same with your friend. No discussing it, no therapy? Real relationships need work.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*Their mom never okay it. Nobody did. They just planned it out behind everyone\'s back. It wasn\'t about being perfect or working in it. It\'s the fact we\'ve told them something directly and they didn\'t care for our opinions. If they don\'t care what we think in something as important as a wedding and engagement, what would happen to other decisions? They aren\'t lovesick teens, they are grown men that should know better and respect when they are told -no-.*\n\n---\n\n**u/ImpassionateGods001** (downvoted)\n&gt;I\'m sorry, I\'m gonna get downvoted here, but if this is real both Amy and OP sound like insuferable bitches. I agree it is tacky, and they were told no before, but there was no malicious intent here, and the brother probably thought it was a nice bonding moment for them to do it that way. They\'ll be better without these over dramatic women in their lives.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I\'m better too. Now I don\'t have to pay for his food, rent, and all the hobbies he can\'t afford.*\n\n---\n\n**u/bongskiman** (downvoted)\n&gt;Both were stupid with what they did. I know you and your friend are mad, but somehow, I feel you could have resolved it by talking calmly. I mean, people make mistakes, but people learn as well. And some even become much better versions of themselves after things like this. I suggest you and your friend cool off, then talk to your SOs again. At least now they know you don\'t F off with your boundaries.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I don\'t know about Amy, but I have no intentions of going back. Other things have happened that had me on the corner. The fact that he ignored me saying no directly and then stealing my stuff and having his friends harrass me have made me unlikely to ever speak to him again as a partner.*\n\n---\n\n**u/Grouchy-Storm-6758**\n&gt;Make sure you change your locks ASAP! That way he doesn’t move back in while you are on vacation (or steal more of your stuff)!\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe put up cameras in your home “just in case”.\n&gt;\n&gt;Good luck to both of you girls!\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I have cameras and already called the landlord. I\'ll also have a house sitter for the pets so it won\'t be empty.*\n\n---\n\n**u/BlkNtvTerraFFVI**\n&gt;This seems like a massive overreaction\n&gt;\n&gt;I wouldn\'t say you\'re in the wrong but this isn\'t the sort of thing most people would break up a relationship over, in either yours or Amy\'s case\n&gt;\n&gt;I\'m not sure why I\'d annul a marriage just because my husband\'s brother proposed to my friend at the wedding\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*It wasn\'t for that explicitly. The annulment is because he went behind her back to do something against her wishes. On something as important as a wedding. Imagine if this was something else like an economic decision or something related to health? Or kids?*\n\n---\n\n**u/Maximal_gain**\n&gt;NTA Block them all and move on. Also, change the locks and passwords Danny had access to. Same with anything financial. Sorry this has happened, it’s never fun when your SO ignores your wishes. Trust me I know….\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*We never merged finances thankfully. I paid for everything, so I kept a tight leash on my personal bank account. I do have some passwords to change, but nothing that will kill me if he has for a few more days. Locks are being change this weekend.*\n\n---\n\n**u/Titian-HairedMermaid**\n&gt;How did you manage to change the airline tickets &amp; other reservations for an international trip from Bobby’s name to yours? That warrants purchasing another ticket entirely.\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*I am purchasing a ticket for myself. The one from Bobby he can do whatever he wants with it. The hotel reservations were on Amy\'s name since she paid for the honeymoon herself.*\n\n---\n\n**OOP Replied to deleted comment**\n&gt;*It\'s not forbidden, but its a giant social -no-. Aside from that, for me it was the fact that after I\'ve maintained Danny for the last few years in the literal sense, he disregards my opinion just like that. He knows I hate PDA. I especially hate public attention like proposals. I\'m not even big on the idea of a wedding for myself. This was my bestfriend\'s wedding and the only reason I was involved was that.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*As for Amy, she has her reasons but I know the big one is being dismissed when she explicitly said she wasn\'t okay with a proposal during her wedding day.*\n\n---\n\n**u/noblelie17** (downvoted)\n&gt;ETA here.\n&gt;\n&gt;The boys went against the women\'s wishes, despite being told otherwise. Op\'s boyfriend seems like a jackass, stealing a TV and a console. I\'m sure there are bigger issues here.\n&gt;\n&gt;The women here are also wrong. Annuling a marriage over this? Absolutely drama queen behavior. Breaking up and kicking someone out if a shared living space? Incredibly dramatic.\n&gt;\n&gt;All in all, all 4 participants seem like they\'re better off without the others. This whole story is a shit show\n&gt;\n&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;*It was my space, not his. I paid for everything. So I reserve the right to kick anyone I want from -my- space. If he paid rent, it would be different.*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;**u/SmittenBlackKitten**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Wait, he didn\'t pay rent, knew you didn\'t want marriage right now and did this anyway, and the fiancé paid basically nothing for the wedding and honeymoon? What exactly did you two see in these guys? They both sound like losers.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;**OOP**\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*They were charming, I can give them that. I was better positioned economically. My friend is much better than her husband/exhusband (still in the air there). It just made sense we took the monetary responsabilities until things balanced out. Except in my case they never did. Hers was slowly getting better.*\n\n---\n# **Final Update: Same post - 20 days later**\n---\n\n[**AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend of 10 years after he proposed during my best friend\'s wedding?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ejeruq/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_of_10/)\n\nI\'m going to do a quick update since after this, I plan to just go back to my normal reddit account.\n\nTo begin with Amy and I are almost at the date to leave. Bobby and her have been talking and agreed to couple therapy after we return from Australia. I\'ve also talk with him and he apologized to me. He didn\'t know how fractured my relationship with his brother was, but figured it out by the way Danny acted after we broke up.\n\nFor the people telling me I should have given him a chance or that he wanted to do a gesture out of love, you are insane. It wasn\'t love, but him trying not to lose his meal ticket. Bobby told me after our break up, Danny began to bad talk me to his family. Claiming I stole all his money, his apartment, his pets, etc. He even started to claim he was going to sue me. All of our stuff in the apartment was paid by me. Our pets were -my- pets. The dog was my birthday gift and I\'ve had my parrot since I was in middle school.\n\nAt first Bobby was on his brother\'s side until he noticed Danny wasn\'t working ever. When he asked Danny about his job, Danny fessed up and admitted that all the money he had was what I would give him. Apparently he still refuses to work, instead couch surfing from friend to friend. Apparently Danny admitted to Bobby he wanted to marry me mostly because I was -okay- with him not working and he didn\'t want a wife nagging him about work. He could play all day while I paid all the bills and did the house chores. Bobby was very apologetic, but I told him it was fine. It wasn\'t. I just don\'t want to throw more wood to the fire when Amy and him are trying to somewhat get things worked out.\n\nI still have another four months on my lease, so I\'ll be moving in December. I have to admit, these last weeks being single have been the best I\'ve had in forever. I\'m happier, healthier, and I\'ve been able to cut my hours at work without risking being paycheck to paycheck.\n\nLast, to the people saying because I\'m in my 30s this might have been my last chance, gtfo. I\'m not interested in a traditional \'family\' being a wifey and popping out babies left and right. I am more than happy being in a child-free partnership without some wedding. It\'s not me being \'feminist\' or woke or whatever. It\'s just I find weddings stupid and I dislike children. I respect women that can live a traditional life, but that\'s not for me.\n\nAnd no, I never recovered my TV. A small price to pay to get my life back.\n\nBtw, I appreciate the supporting PMs, but as I said when I started this post, this is a throwaway. I plan to delete it later in the week. Thank you for the good advice of some reddits and sorry if I didn\'t answer all comments or Pms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TOP/RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**OOP Replied to a very big thread**\n\n&gt;*Okay, OP here to give you some semblance of reality: Marriage was never in consideration. I didn\'t want to be proposed in a wedding and was clear that was not going to be a thing I agreed on. I have every agency to say -no-. There\'s no discussion. I won\'t bend on that. Public proposals, especially on someone else\'s wedding, are a straight -no-. Period.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**I am not the OOP.

(431, 'reddit', '1oj3q42', 'Dropout vs DropoutCirclejerk - the Final Battle of Parasocial Reddit Moderators, featuring racism, therapy speak, performative activism, and more!', 'Firstly, I want to shout out KinkyCeles for the [initial post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1oifi6c/the_head_mod_of_rdropoutcirclejerk_makes_a/) that brought this to our attention (please leave it up, TITCJ, the comments are great!). This post serves as a write up which goes into detail of the history of these subreddits, as well as some extremely buttery new updates between yesterday and this morning (10/29/25).\n\n## What is Dropout\n\nThe streaming service Dropout originated from the long-running comedy site CollegeHumor, which was founded in 1999 by Josh Abramson and Ricky Van Veen. In September 2018, CollegeHumor launched Dropout as a subscription, ad-free streaming platform focused on original comedy content, transitioning away from the ad-driven model of its predecessor. \n\nIn 2020, performer and CollegeHumor alumnus Sam Reich purchased the company from its previous owner IAC, steering the platform into a leaner, creator-driven business model built on subscriber support rather than massive scale advertising. Under Sam Reich, the company fully rebranded to Dropout, focusing on comedy game shows, improve, and tabletop role-playing series (specifically, Dimension 20), carving out a niche in an otherwise crowded streaming ecosystem. \n\n## tl;dr: The Fandom Turns On Itself\n\nThe fan communities are in open conflict. /r/DropoutCirclejerk, a satire sub that mocks the overly positive and parasocial side of the Dropout fandom, accused the moderation team of the main subreddit, /r/Dropout, of racism and suppression of criticism. After a night of heated debate, one of the /r/Dropout moderators responded directly in the thread. The next morning, the main sub\'s moderators released an official post acknowledging the issue and admitting to mishandling it. \n\n## Background\n\nDemi Adejuyigbe, a comedian and musician known for his work on The Good Place, and various Dropout appearances (most notably on Make Some Noise, and Game Changer). In a podcast interview, Demi discussed a long-running discomfort he’s felt about being called “wholesome” by white fans, particularly white women, describing it as a racial microaggression. He explained that while the term might seem complimentary, it often carries undertones of infantilization and de-sexualization, implying that he\'s \"safe\" or \"non-threatening\" compared to other black men. Demi said, \"What you are really saying is you’re not how we usually see Black men... you’re not threatening… you feel safe, like a puppy.\"\n\nDemi had previously joked on social media that he was keeping a tally of how many white people called him wholesome, and that when he reached 1,000, he’d \"buy a gun\"\n\nThis caused a discussion to break out on the post [\"So the regular sub has a racist mod that doesn\'t like being called out, I guess\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1ohw78r/so_the_regular_sub_has_a_racist_mod_that_doesnt/) when deathfire123 made a comment accusing Demi of \"making it a problem for everyone\" and seeking validation for not liking how people engage with him, suggesting Demi\'s comfort wasn\'t about racism but wanting control over fan interactions. \n\nIn-depth discussion on the issues and various references to it can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1oj3q42/dropout_vs_dropoutcirclejerk_the_final_battle_of/nm0aa2h/). \n\n## The Drama\n\nOn October 28th, /r/DropoutCirclejerk\'s head moderator, VictoriaDallon, posted a long call-out thread titled [About r/Dropout and its mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1oibh4o/about_rdropout_and_its_mod_team/). The post alleged that:\n\n* Members of /r/Dropout\'s mod team engaged in racist microaggressions toward a POC moderator who had previously been part of their team. \n* When concerns were raised, other moderators allegedly dismissed or tone-policed the complaints rather than addressing them. \n* The /r/Dropout team allegedly protected one mod, volkmasterblood, and allowed him to continue moderating. \n* One of the head moderators, deathfire123, was accused of prioritizing \"image management\" over meaningful accountability. \n\nThe post quickly gained traction within the circlejerk community, with users describing it as an example of \"fake positivity and corporate vibes\" \n\n## Lone Moderator Response\n\nLate in the thread, one of the /r/Dropout moderators Winterisnowcold [commented directly in the thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1oibh4o/about_rdropout_and_its_mod_team/nlw9qs2/). They denied overt racism, but admitted that the team\'s internal discussions \"hadn\'t been handled gracefully.\" They argued that no single moderator was blameless and insisted that the allegations lacked full context. Obviously, that comment did not go over well, and noted that they took a defensive stance, and repeatedly claimed to not be \"safe commenting here\" when prompted for specifics. \n\n## The Official Response\n\nThe next morning, /r/Dropout\'s moderation team posted [Re: r/dropoutcirclejerk](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/) on the main subreddit. In the post, they acknowledged the harm caused, admitting that critics were \"not entirely wrong.\" The mods said they had \"prioritized tone over substance and centered their own discomfort instead of listening.\" \n\nThey specifically referenced mod deathfire123 noting that his comments had a \"concerning impact\" but did not merit suspension, adding that he\'d apologized privately. The post concluded by promising to \"be less defensive and more open going forward.\" \n\nThe post is currently being received negatively, with the post sitting at 13% upvoted, and all moderator responses being hidden due to the downvote threshold. \n\n## Fun comment threads\n\nFrom /r/dropoutcirclejerk \n\n* [Volkmasterblood is such a Nazi-ass username.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1oibh4o/about_rdropout_and_its_mod_team/nluh5kn/)\n** [More on the weird username](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1oibh4o/about_rdropout_and_its_mod_team/nluckl0/)\n* [Community looking to claim a different subreddit, and turn it into the main, primary Dropout sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1oibh4o/about_rdropout_and_its_mod_team/nlu9pbt/) **Edit: It looks like VictoriaDallon has succeeded in claiming /r/DropoutTV**\n* [\"I\'m online a lot but I\'m not online enough for this - it\'s like driving past a car wreck and wondering what happened\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1oibh4o/about_rdropout_and_its_mod_team/nlubgq6/)\n\nFrom /r/dropout \n\n* [\"I think you are misrepresenting what happened and taking very selective accountability.\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/nlzo1a5/)\n* [Discussing where the \"apology\" can be found](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/nlzmo6n/)\n* [“A Jewish mod on our team isn’t bothered by the connotations” sounds a lot like “I have a black friend irl” tbh.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/nlzlw8b/)\n* [volkmasterblood trolling users in the /r/Dropout comments with award winning tropes like \"Cope\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/nm0aqj5/)\n* [VictoriaDallon](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/nm015p6/) comments in the /r/Dropout thread\n\n---\n\nEdit, [a buttery reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1oj1ndg/re_rdropoutcirclejerk/nm0f9fn/) from volkmasterblood: \n\n&gt;This is all Im gonna say.

LateStageCapitalism (which I’ve been banned from for saying North Korea isn’t communist), Leftist, SocialistRA, anti work, Work Reform, and Political Revolution.\n\n&gt;Im a leftist through and through who chose a username that I didn’t think two seconds about. Combined it with my actual name (the Volk part, which is why ppl were calling me Volk), and two old game tags. Do I regret it? I’m a fucking socialist. Of course I do.\n\n&gt;But I’m not gonna run from my mistakes. Never have (at least in the past 8-9 years). If people truly want to judge me then they should look at who I am and what I write about and not just a poorly chosen username.\n\n&gt;I’ve tried to change it multiple times even reaching out to admin about it dozens of times. But it’s too late. And I’m content with that. If people take one look at the username and judge me, that’s on them.\n\n&gt;If people want to message me then they can. Im not afraid of authentic conversations. Just be authentic and Im good on my end.”\n\n&gt;Deathfire: It was a mistake. It wasn’t blatant racism. It was a guy using verbiage he’s used to describe other cast members who then didn’t think about how the words might affect this current cast member. Once someone pointed it out, he didn’t double down. He apologized and kept it up as to educate others.\n\n&gt;That’s usually what you want from people in this scenario. This is not Charlie Kirk (rest in piss) levels of racism. This isn’t even racist uncle at thanksgiving levels of racism. This is “dude, that’s racist” “oh fuck, sorry about that! Im gonna apologize and not do that again. Also gonna think more deeply about people when I respond to them.” IMO, if that’s not enough for you, touch grass.\n\n&gt;Victoria: Blocked her months ago. She’s pissed about that. She didn’t like the 2 separate apologies I sent to her. So I sent a third.\n\n&gt;Do you know what other deal she made with DF? That she’d send an apology in her own words to me for being a general ass to me and the mod team. Never did that. So I kept low. Didn’t say shit for awhile. Thought “She’s probably not gonna apologize, too stubborn. So whatever.\n\n&gt;But the second she brought up promises of the past and being accountable, I brought up the apology. Which she then continued to lie about.\n\n&gt;So where are the receipts? I don’t give a fuck. Im not here for you and your witch hunt. Im here for me. Im here to moderate a sub. Not answer to the CJ tribunal.\n\n&gt;The only way I’ll get removed is if my profile gets third strike on saying something something second amendment related to fascists again.\n\n&gt;The rest of the mod team are fairly diplomatic and kind people. Im more of a realist. We all have lives. We all are trying to survive in this proto-fascist state, and this sub is not the place you will find victory in. Out in the real world is where it’s at.\n\n&gt;Is that dismissive? Fuck yeah it is. I am dismissing the concept that your work here (brow beating DF or making the 69th joke about my username) is anything helpful to any cause around the world or in the USA.\n\n&gt;You want a debate or to hound me? Go ahead. I got work so it might be 8-10 hours before I can return. Also, lol at the person telling Snoo they should stay online permanently to respond. Get a fucking life.\n\n---\n\n**Edit as of 10/30/25**\n\n## Major Update\n\nSnooNarhwal [has asked Deathfire123 and volkmasterblood to step down from the mod team, and they have.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropout/comments/1okkqrj/mod_team_changes_and_the_path_forwards/)\n\nComments are locked in /r/Dropout, but [not locked in /r/Dropoutcirclejerk\'s update post](https://old.reddit.com/r/dropoutcirclejerk/comments/1okktfk/mod_team_changes_and_the_path_forwards/).

Thinking about ending things based on her behavior', '**I am not The OOP, OOP is u/TuffVolcano**\n\n**GF and I (26M/F) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. Thinking about ending things based on her behavior**\n\n**Originally posted to r/relationship_advice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!entitlement!&lt;\n\n[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)  **May 19, 2019**\n\nSo, my GF and I (both 26) got in a fight about this two nights ago, and she\'s making it seem like I\'m being an asshole. We\'ve been dating for ~4.5 months.\n\n\n \nMy girlfriend has a ~2013 Lenovo laptop that has seen better days. As it stands right now, among some other issues, her keyboard totally doesn\'t work. Because of this, she always uses a small bluetooth keyboard with her laptop.\n \n\n\nShe had texted me the next morning saying that her wireless keyboard had stopped working as well. We had already planned for me to stay the night at her place after I got off work, so I offered to stop by my place on the way to grab her a keyboard, as I have a few extras.\n \n\n\nWhen I got to her place, she was eagerly awaiting the keyboard, which makes sense, as she wasn\'t able to use her computer for most of the day. But when I handed her the keyboard, she started getting really quiet and pouty. A bit later, when I asked her what was wrong, she said she thought I\'d be bringing her something nicer, like the keyboard I have at my desk.\n \n\n\nThe thing is, I have a really nice keyboard at my desk. I\'m a programmer, and I love this keyboard so much that I also bring it to work with me. I even have specific macro profiles for it that definitely improve my workflow.\n \n\n\nFor context, I had an extra Amazon Basics keyboard (~$15) lying around, still brand new in the box. My personal keyboard, which I\'ve had for years, is some variant of the Razer Blackwidow (~$120).\n \n\n\nAnyway, she was apparently expecting me to be \'selfless\' and let her use my nice keyboard while I used the Amazon keyboard. She was upset that I didn\'t \"value her enough\" to lend her my nice posessions, and left her with the \"cheap $10 keyboard\" (her words). She said if the situation was reversed, she\'d lend me the nice keyboard. I explained to her that I have my keyboard specifically set up for work, and because I\'m so used to it, it would hinder my ability to do work if I didn\'t have it.\n \n\n\nWe continued to argue about it. Things really came to a head when she boldly claimed that if I wasn\'t willing to lend her my nice keyboard, that I \"should have bought her a nice new keyboard if I really cared about her.\" This is when I got really mad. I told her she was acting like an entitled, spoiled child and that she should have been grateful that I went out of my way in the first place to grab her the Amazon keyboard. She started crying and asked me to go home. I left, but I still gave her the Amazon keyboard to use. **I was far more upset at the principle of the situation than the keyboard itself.**\n \n\n\nSo now she\'s calling me an asshole for both not giving her my keyboard AND because I called her spoiled. We\'re going to meet up tomorrow to talk about this in person because I refused to continue this silly argument over text.\n\n\n \nI\'m thinking about ending things with her, as I feel like this is her showing me her true colors.\n\n\n \nTL;DR: GFs keyboard broke. I lent her one of my extras, and she got upset that it was a \'cheap\' keyboard. I called her spoiled, which infuriated her.\n\n\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**comfymistake**\n\n&gt; You are honestly 100% right. She is acting like a spoiled child. Beggars don’t get to be choosers. She wants your nice keyboard? She can buy one for herself. Better yet she can buck up and save up for a new laptop.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don’t blame you at all for feeling angry. I think you should attempt to talk through it before you decide to break up with her. But it is definitely a red flag that she’s acting this way\n\n**~**\n\n**infogurrrle**\n\n&gt;I think you got it right when you said she was a spoiled brat. She should have been grateful that you came over with a keyboard, any kind of keyboard. Maybe she should take her own advice a be a little “selfless”. I would pose a question to you, if you two are fighting over a keyboard, what will happen when an issue that is a bit more serious comes up? Good luck with your talk, I have a feeling you are going to need it.\n\n**LMKBK**\n\n&gt;&gt;\"Never marry someone until you\'ve seen how they act on a really bad day.\"\n\n \n**EDIT:** She texted me asking to meet up tonight instead of tomorrow, as she is feeling anxious and stressed about the situation. **I will give everyone an update later tonight or tomorrow morning.**\n\n\n \nI also wanted to clarify that she\'s never acted like this before (although, admittedly, we haven\'t been together for very long). Some of you suggested that maybe I\'m not making her feel \'valued\' and this situation is a symptom of that. While I think I both show AND tell her that she\'s valued in different ways, this may be something I bring up with her. It, of course, doesn\'t forgive her behavior, but may explain some of it. Cheers.\n\n\n\n[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqra9h/update_gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)  **May 20, 2019 (Next Day)**\n\nWe met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. I was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so I suggested we meet at her place, so that I could bail if things went south...and they did.\n \n\n\nEven though I thought I made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my GFs coworkers figured out who the post was about (GF\'s age, working HR [which I mentioned in a comment], same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my GF. The reason she wanted to meet early was because she was FURIOUS that I had made the post, \'airing our dirty laundry.\' In a sense, I guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. My GF never used Reddit so I figured I was safe. There\'s a strong chance she\'ll read this one as well, lol.\n \n\n\nAnyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that I made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. I asked her to point out ANY part of it that wasn\'t true, or where I had lied. Long story short, she couldn\'t point to a single thing. I definitely raised my voice when I told her that if she looked bad, it\'s only because of her actions. I told her I only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. The post was 100% accurate and she knew it.\n\n\n \nShe began to tear up and asked me if I really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. I asked her if she understood that this WASN\'T ABOUT THE KEYBOARD. It was about the way she acted towards me when I was trying to do her a favor. She stayed silent and didn\'t answer. I asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was OK with her. I asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.\n \n\n\nShe got really defensive, asking \"Are you calling me crazy?\" and \"Do you think I\'m unstable?\" I had no idea where she was going with this. I told her I wasn\'t calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that I was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it.\n\n\n \nWe talked in circles for a bit, and I tried to pry it out of her. I still don\'t know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn\'t tell me. When I realized our conversation was going nowhere, I finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. She asked, \"What do you want from me?\" and I said, \"I want an apology.\"\n \n\n\nI\'m getting tired of typing so I\'ll wrap this up quickly. She was absolutely unwilling to apologize. She thought that my \"betrayal\" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. We talked for about 5 more minutes before I told her that I don\'t even care anymore. I told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn\'t willing to help us get to the bottom if this. That we should just break up. I didn\'t waste any time making my way to the door.\n\n\n \nAs I was leaving, she asked if I wanted the keyboard back. She didn\'t ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. I could tell by her tone of voice. I told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.\n \n\n\nI\'ve been getting TONS of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my FB). She obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like I really did leave her over the keyboard. I couldn\'t care less, as I\'ll never be seeing any of them again.\n \n\n\nWe only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, I don\'t feel terribly heartbroken. Mostly just relief that it\'s over. But...also confusion. Still have no idea why she acted out.\n \n\n\nTL;DR: She wouldn\'t apologize or tell me what was wrong. After an exhausting conversation, I decided to end it.\n\n\n \n**And to the people who had some unkind words towards me because I use a Razer keyboard: Pound sand, dorks. I like what I like.**\n\n\n\nVERY SHORT EDIT: She called earlier today and was very apologetic. My assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how I was right for leaving her, among other things. I told her that she had her chance to apologize.\n\n\n\n**TOP COMMENT**\n\n**OceansOfUmbrellas**\n\n&gt; I saw a comment on Reddit a while back that asked why so many relationships fail at approximately the three month point, and someone (no, I\'m not going to spend twenty plus minutes Googling to give credit to the person) replied that they\'d once been told it was because it was really hard for people to continue pretending to be someone they weren\'t for much longer than three months.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think maybe this applies to your situation.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o3z2x6/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/', 11058, 1198, '2025-10-11 15:52:16', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),
(435, 'reddit', '1o7hsed', 'I just saved a cat from my walls: what do I do?', 'This is a very long and bizarre situation and I\'d like to ask for advice since I\'m very new to cats, I\'ll leave a tldr at the bottom just in case.\n\nTwo days ago I heard what sounded like meowing coming from the walls of my bathroom. I wasn\'t sure if it was a cat or just my ventilation ducts being bad (my apartment kind of sucks and I\'ve had problems everywhere), so I put in a maintenance request. Yesterday, I received a call from my apartment maintenance staff saying they cut holes in the drywall of my dining area and found a kitten in my walls and that it wasn\'t cooperating with them in coming out, so they put some wet food in a cage and just hoped the kitten would smell the food and eventually come out. The kitten was running around in the back of the wall behind two pipes, and after some inspection I realized that the kitten might be too short to climb over the pipes and too scared (or its head was too large) to climb through the pipes. Additionally, one maintenance guy said the kitten had fallen into (or walked in? Idrk) my insulation through a vent, and that there were 2 or 3 other kittens by that ventilation opening. I have no clue what that means or where that vent is, but that means this kitten is potentially part of a larger litter of kittens belonging to another cat somewhere in my apartment complex.\n\nAfter talking with my maintenance people some more I got the impression that they weren\'t going to actively try to help the kitten get out, and I happen to have a soul and don\'t want a kitten to just die, so my friends and I took matters into our own hands. I took the wet food from the cage and placed it into the drywall so the kitten didn\'t starve (cuz it had been almost 2 days without food at this point), and my friends came over and were able to fish the kitten out. After about two hours of luring him around with wet cat food we finally got him out of my walls and got him to a vet.\n\nThe next part I wasn\'t present for (I work pretty insane hours so I had to go to bed), but the vet apparently said there was no microchip and the cat was very healthy and well fed. Apparently he\'s around 4 weeks old (no guarantees though). The vets conclusion was that the mother was somewhere nearby in my apartment complex, but since the kitten wasn\'t microchipped they said it\'s likely that the kitten and its mother are both strays. If what that other maintenance guy said earlier is true then theres a whole litter of strays, with at least 2 or 3 other kittens somewhere in my apartment complex. \n\nCurrently two of my friends who helped rescue the kitten are taking care of him, they\'re roommates and happen to own two other cats (one of whom they raised as a kitten) so he\'s in good hands for now, but they don\'t have the means to fully own him and continue raising him. We\'re planning on taking him to get dewormed and vaccinated next week. I\'ve been looking into getting a cat for a while now and I\'ve reached a point of financial stability in my life so I think I can handle it. I originally intended to adopt from the Atlanta Humane Society, but after living with this kitten for almost 2 days in my walls I want to find a home for him. \n\nHowever, I recognized that this is a kitten and not a fully grown cat, and that comes with a different set of challenges. \n\nHopefully yall enjoyed the cat saving story! Now my friends and I need advice.\n\nFirst: I\'d like to take care of this kitten myself! I want to own a cat, and I have plenty of space in my apartment for one since I live alone in a 1b1b. However since it\'s a kitten I\'m aware that comes with certain other challenges: I\'ve read a bit from kittenlady.org, and my friends are currently weaning the kitten onto wet food. Additionally, I work from 7 am to 4 pm roughly on a 9-40 schedule (every other week I get friday off), so my apartment will be vacant while I am at work. I also don\'t know how often he needs to be fed, and I\'m not sure if he\'ll be fully weaned off by the time I\'d have to take him in. That being said, I\'m willing to dedicate my entire afternoons and evenings (about 5 hours a day) as well as my weekends and off days to taking care of the kitten and socializing it for as long as that takes. Is that enough time for me to take care of a kitten and feed him? I\'m aware of the paw trick while he\'s sleeping to get him used to me handling his paws, but what other important milestones or tricks do I need to be aware of if I were to raise this kitten?\n\nSecond: I think I\'ve found a comprehensive list of things that I need to buy to take care of cats. On my list I have a litter box, non-clumping litter, wet food (and eventually dry kibble), cat toys, a scratching post, pee pads, and a cat enclosure since I don\'t have a small restricted space for the kitten. I\'m also going to buy an automatic feeder down the line, but I\'m not sure if thats a good idea for now since he\'s still a kitten. Is there anything else I need to purchase to take care of a kitten?\n\nThird: I will be checking around my apartment later today to see if I can find the momma strays and the other kittens in the litter. I know the momma stray exists since I\'ve seen her roaming around my apartment, and I\'m planning to buy some wet food to lure her out. After that though I have no plan and no idea what I should do next. Any advice? I live in the Atlanta metro area in Georgia, so do I take them all to the humane society? If I can\'t find the vent or the rest of the litter, what else can I do?\n\nTLDR: I just saved a 4 month old kitten from my walls and I want to take care of him, but it would be my first cat and I need advice.

(436, 'reddit', '1o7dwgo', '(Badass trope) Forget final farewells, lets focus on final Fuck You’s', 'Times where a character knows they are about to die or be defeated and chooses to perform one final act just to spite someone else. \n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Returns\n\n“I win. I made you lose control, and they’ll kill you for it. See you… in hell!” \n\nOne of the most iconic examples of this trope. Batman and Joker have been going at each other for years and all Joker wants is to break the code of the bat. So when they have their final fight, Batman breaks Jokers neck in a moment of desperation which doesn’t kill him but paralyses him. He didn’t get Batman to break his no kill rule but got him to bend it enough to be satisfied he had won and with his final act the Joker breaks his own neck fully to kill himself as everyone will think that Batman killed him, which will turn the world against him. He did all of this while laughing and never stopped laughing, even when Batman told his corpse to stop.\n\nSherlock\n\n“As long as Im alive, you can save your friends. You’ve got a way out… well good luck with that”\n\nThe two masterminds end their duel of wits with Moriarty planning for hitmen to kill all of Sherlocks friends unless they see him jump off the building they are standing on to his death. Sherlock then realises that Moriarty must have a way to call these hitmen off and all he has to do is torture him to get it. Moriarty is not convinced Sherlock has what it takes to do that but Sherlock makes it very clear that he does. Moriarty realises he can and will do this, so instead he pulls out a gun, puts it in his mouth and fires, all to force Sherlock into choosing between his own life or his friends with no way out. \n\nSquid Games\n\n&gt;!“Im sorry… but I don’t want to be your lunch box”!&lt;\n\n&gt;!In the final game of Squid Games, the idea of the game is that there are 3 platforms that they all go to together but they can only go to the next one when one person minimum jumps or is thrown off the current platforms. Fighting each other on these platforms is very awkward and it is very likely that if you try to push someone off, that they will grab you and pull you off with them which means everyone has to be very careful with how they deal with the situation. One of the guys has the idea to prepare someone like a “lunch box” where they beat them up so they cant move on their own, throw someone off the current platform, carry the beaten up person to the next platform and then throw them off while they cant put up a fight. They beat someone up but then long story short, only the beaten up person and 2 other guys are left (There is another player but that’s another story). Before the 2 guys can carry the beaten up guy to the next platform he says he doesn’t want to be their lunch box and willingly throws himself off the platform just so the other 2 guys cant throw him off themselves. He knew he was going to die but he refused to let it be to the benefit of others.!&lt;\n\nPirates Of the Caribbean\n\n“James Norrington do you fear death?… I take that as a no”\n\nHaving saved a group of people from Davy Jones’s ship, James suffers a fatal wound and is left bleeding out to death rapidly while Davy Jones himself knees down in front of him and asks him if he fears death. Without a word, James stabs Davy with his last ounce of strength, knowing full well that he cant be killed and it doesn’t even hurt him, before dying to his wounds. For someone who acutely cowardly before, in the face of death he did not flinch.\n\nSword Art Online Abridged \n\n“Hey, if I gotta die anyway, the least I can do is make sure YOU don’t get to enjoy it”\n\nThis parody version of Kirito is an immensely insulting and sassy asshole that almost everyone hates. Kirito is betrayed by someone that paralyses them and is taking their time killing him by stabbing them over and over as they are overwhelmed by revenge. Kirito, even though he is in a lot of pain, is constantly making insulting jokes at his attacker like normal and when the attacker demands that he shuts up as he is taking the fun out of murdering him, Kirito has already accepted that if he is going to die here then he will go out as an immensely insulting and sassy asshole out of the purest spite.\n\nBaki\n\n“It was a cell memory that jack had engraved into his inner most being, so that even when he had lost consciousness he could still administer the worlds most powerful Fuck You”\n\nJack is having a bare fisted duel with someone and Jack gets beaten so badly that he is left slumped unconscious against a wall but his attacker doesn’t finish him off. A much shorter person goes to check on Jack and triggers Jacks last trap which only misses him because of his height. Jack had practiced a move so much that his body would perform it even if he was unconscious and this move is to slam both his hands in front of him while doing the middle finger which, if the attacker was the same height as him, would have shoved both his middle fingers straight into their ears and killed them.

I wanted to create a ritual that feels intentional - more like putting a specific record on a turntable than swimming through an infinite stream of musical content. As a millennial I never really had a record collection, but I did have cassettes, and they remind me of a time where listening to music was THE activity I was doing, not a background layer of stimulation on top of 3 other ongoing tasks. \n\nNFC Cassette tapes are already a thing you can buy, but I wanted to redesign them in a way where they look and feel realistic. Mine are made up of several 3d printed parts, laser cut acrylic, and custom labels that were cut out on a vinyl cutter. Two separate halves are screwed together to avoid requiring any support material during the print, and honestly the screws add a level of realism that I really enjoy. You can also spin the white rollers with a pencil if you like (or your pinky finger like I used to do).\n\nThe actual \"player\" was the most fun to develop. A phone is the perfect candidate for a modern NFC cassette player, because it already has a speaker, an NFC reader, a screen to visualize playback and take (purposefully minimal) user input, volume controls, internet connection, and apps like Spotify to deal with the music playback. I modeled the case in Rhino 3d based on some designs I had sketched, and used downloaded 3d models of my phone and cassette tapes to establish the scale of the overall form. \n\nThe parts were printed on a Bambu Labs P1S, and the app was developed first in Processing (using Android mode) and then was ported over to android studio (with a great deal of help from ChatGPT to get all the Spotify integration working).\n\nThere are challenges making this work with iOS including the position of the NFC reader on iPhones, as well as the limitation of the operating system to prevent NFC tags from opening apps without the user approving first, but if there is enough interest I might look into creating designs that accommodate a wider range of phones.\n\nThanks for watching, I hope you like the project.

Any normal person would refuse to communicate with a person who records themselves doing hate crimes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I\'ve only known about Destiny for 2 months now, but I can\'t trust this dude\'s judgement anymore.

Destiny for a long time now does not cut anyone off until they personally come at him.

So long as Destiny isn\'t creating content with or endorsing her that\'s his own business to deal with, in my opinion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has he associated with xena since?

He had a relatively serious romantic relationship with a popular far-right conservative(my nazi queen ❤️). He\'s said in the past that he likes girls who basically fight with him on everything and how he doesn\'t like the submissive wallflower type.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To be fair to destiny, he just is very bad judge of character overall.\n\n---\n\n&gt; Maybe if progressives weren’t so mean to him he wouldn’t feel compelled to bring a Nazi on tour\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What evidence is there that he brought her? It sounds like she decided to come on her own. Like c\'mon guys use your brains. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Between his messages and the photos of her in his apartment one can assume, but you’re right! He doesn’t accuse her of stalking him which is what I would say if this person decided to follow me across the country against my wishes, but I guess she could’ve showed up without Steven giving anybody a heads up that he’s been chilling with an unhinged Nazi the last few days which would be inconsiderate to the people paying him to say the least\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not banning her does not mean he brought her along. It\'s entirely possible that he doesn\'t care if she\'s there and she decided to come along and see him. It\'s a public event that anyone can go to, he doesn\'t have to announce she\'ll be there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \"the photos of her in his apartment one can assume\"\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the only thing to me that could be damning and indicate he could be lying.

You’ve been here for 12 years through all the crazy ass scandals, but you draw the line at… hanging out with some edgy OF girl for a day. Not even on stream, didn’t interact with her at the event. You’re just tweaking rn, give the emotions a week or two to settle, then you’ll be back like nothing happened\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To be fair, this person seems uniquely unhinged in a way that feels meaningfully different from some of the past undesirables lol. I\'m just a guy though wtf do I know lmao pls don\'t ban me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, from what I’ve seen this person does seem quite unhinged. But I guess I’m just not making the connection of her being a meaningful part of Destiny’s stream/life. My understanding is he isn’t in any type of relationship with her and has only been casually chatting, and then hung out once in person. I think it’s super valid to feel upset that he’s engaging with such a person, but the reaction in this thread would make me think this is Pxie 2.0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think people\'s main issue is the fact that she\'s at the unfuck america tour calling a black guy the N word and regardless of whether he invited her or not, it\'s a bad look. I do understand the whole \"Republicans don\'t care about how awful they are so why should libs\", but at the same time this is pretty fucking insane. Now before I get nuked from orbit, let me say that I don\'t know if he invited her, at the same time, shit like this should be met with an immediate \"What the actual fuck is wrong with you, don\'t do that and don\'t come here\". And if that\'s not immediate, at least after you figure out what happened and have the details, you ought tell this person not to come to these events. Then if they show up, out of your hands. Maybe behind the scenes he messaged her or something, I hope so because holy fuck she\'s unhinged lol\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is pretty reasonable, but it doesn’t at all reflect the energy from this community at the moment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***[This comment continues and the thread goes on for a while]***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\'ll be honest, I\'ve similarly been around for some length of time over a decade and honestly this one honestly kinda made me feel done too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Like there was some appeal to the vyvanse putting most of this silly stuff behind him and the current court stuff just being lingering ramifications from past actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And it really did feel that way too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And then this... like I am having literal cognitive dissonance. I think Destiny is one of the smartest people I\'ve seen or heard speak and I simply can\'t get my brain around this decision.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Either the videos of her walking around spitting on homeless people is fake or I fundamentally misunderstood Destiny\'s character. Idk.\n\n---\n\n### All these bans are just like Hasan\n\n&gt; [I have some choice words about this whole ordeal especially considering the whole drama that happened at the start of this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nkw05pi/) But I\'ll keep it to myself. At what point do I just give up hoping things would change.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Considering what he\'s currently dealing with this behavior is absolutely regarded without question. Sucks for all the people including me who have defended him and wished him well through all this shit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Edit: yeah just ban anyone rightfully calling you out bro shits on Hasan all day everyday but literally acts just like him what a fucking joke\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don\'t understand how a man can be so smart and so unbelievably stupid at the same time. It\'s like he hasn\'t learned anything at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Edit:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; o7\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every smart center-left figure has a topic where the logical parts of their brains turn off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill Maher: Islam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sam Harris: Islam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mehdi Hasan: Islam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Destiny: BPD Women\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There\'s a reason why Adam Mogler will continue to grow Nationally on Network Television and Destiny will continue to stream. That\'s just how Dman is wired just accept it and goodluck to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Edit: o7 Brothers see you in Valhalla\n\n---\n\n### Some don\'t like how she promotes her OnlyFans to minors\n\n&gt; [Why the fuck is Destiny hanging out with her?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nkvyz0o/) And inviting her to events?\n&gt; \n&gt; Forget her racism/homophobia on Twitter, she has tried pushing her OF to minors.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; No you don\'t get it shes really intelligent\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; edit: o7 hopefully the pussy was worth it\n\n---\n\n&gt; &gt; Because he is a nymphomaniac who throws out all his morals and standards when it comes to sex.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aaaaaan im banned. Most sensitive fucking streamer on the internet😂🤣\n\n---\n\n### What he\'s doing is damaging his center left reputation\n\n&gt; [Thanks tiny for bringing the neo nazi racist as a friend to the anti-neo nazi racist tour!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nkvzsiy/) really cool\n&gt; \n&gt; Edit: i got banned for calling out destiny for hanging out with a person who carves swastikas on themselves. destiny and hasan are fucking twins o7\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; o7 to all my fallen dggas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You have been Witnessed. See you in Valhalla.\n\n---\n\n&gt; &gt; Honestly yeah that’s the worst part. Idrc what tiny does in his personal life but if he wants to be taken seriously in the political world he has to keep these interactions away from that. Like if we’re being honest I believe pretty easily and it’s not fair but Destiny’s personal and relationship drama has hurt his career more than joking about Charlie Kirk. When I try to introduce my friends to him the first things they say is “isn’t that guy a cuck”or “didn’t he fly out a 17 year old”. It’s not true or fair but that’s what a lot of people think of when you bring up Destiny, these aren’t even “political” people. I don’t want to sound like an anti-fan. Steven has done a lot, in a lot of ways was one of the only big center left figures holding the line in the social media space. I think it’s important however we seriously start trying to support and build up other bigger center left personalities like Adam Mockler because realistically I think they will be the ones unfortunately not Destiny to really bring more people to our side.\n\n---\n\n### Some aren\'t phased and still appreciate him\n\n&gt; [Aba was right about Destiny.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nl0rrgj/) There is no reason to take his political intentions seriously when he consistently does dumb shit to ruin his own image.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I take his political intentions seriously. He puts in a ton of work and I really appreciate him doing these events as well as the canvassing and other efforts. If he does 10 things and 8/9 of them are positive that\'s an indication for me that he\'s serious about this stuff. He\'s just not perfect. But hey maybe other people have other opinions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \"Not perfect\", meaning consistently involved in scandals ranging from interactions with neo-Nazis to accusations of illegal sexual acts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No one is perfect, but only Destiny seems to consistently find himself in these situations. Maybe it\'s a him problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe, maybe not. I still personally take his political intentions seriously and appreciate the amount of work he puts in. Luckily if one doesn\'t, there are plenty of other political creators to follow and take seriously!\n\n---\n\n### Some don\'t really care\n\n&gt; [Am I supposed to care who he fucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nky49xl/) Long as it\'s consensual idc.

Otherwise, you\'d already know the dick don\'t care where it lays it\'s head at night.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I dont care who he fucks, but why is he posting on twitter with her, why do i have to see her calling people the n word on the front of lsf. I dont care about his personal life but its being forced onto me through his tweets, the mass bans, the dgg comments, and its gross lol. Shes a disgusting subhuman loser.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What?! You never fucked a disgusting sub human loser? Of course not. You mutha fucks are all about the god-damned optics.Fucking the thing you hate and hates you is cathartic. At this point who gives a shit. You aren\'t legally obligated to love what you fuck and he is not obligated to do what basement dwellers demand of him. If he Nukes his shit that\'s his decision. Tiny has accepted he is gonna be on the fringes, because that\'s who he is. He ain\'t polite company. He ain\'t the dude a woman brings home to her father. This is not a man you marry. If you have deluded yourself in believing that you are in some privileged state to change his mind then you are smoking some grade AAA crack cocaine. If you don\'t like. Pick up and move on. Spew your anti fan shit at Kiwi Farms or Jew Stalkers Discord.\n\n---\n\n### Some argue if this is worse than being associates with Nick Fuentes, another famous Neo-Nazi\n\n&gt; [not sure why there\'s so many dipshits in this thread instantly assigning massive blame to anyone found within 30 feet of questionable characters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nkx0627/)  that\'s the same misguided criticism dumbasses made of Destiny when he was hanging out with Nick Fuentes. you\'re supposed to be mad when he starts co-signing deranged things they say\n&gt; \n&gt; it wasn\'t a problem when Hasan talked about BadEmpanada or terrorist propaganda on stream - it was bad when he agreed with everything the terrorists were saying or supported whatever deranged claims BadEmpanada was making\n&gt; \n&gt; come back when it\'s Destiny making the jokes or retweeting them or supporting her. until then assume they\'re friends and that he doesn\'t agree with any of the stupid shit she says\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I judge people by the friends they keep, maybe I\'m weird like that 🤷\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So why are you still here given he\'s friends with Myron, Xena, etc. ? he clearly doesn\'t find the guilt by association a potent critique; given you think it\'s unethical what\'s the motivation for supporting still?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Myron, Xena, Nick etc haven’t stalked random minorities/homeless people around a city spitting on them, hitting them and calling them slurs on camera. This is a whole world worse of an association.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You..you think this chick is worse than nick fuentes and myron gaines?\n\n*[Cont\'d]*\n\n&gt; This chick believes the exact same Nazi bile that Nick and Myron do and perpetuates it on her platforms like they do. The bonus is she is also willing to commit hate crimes on me and my family in public because of our skin colour.\n&gt; \n&gt; So yes, I do think that.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you genuinely think that I can\'t help you. Fuentes and myron have huge followings that they are radicalizing to do much worse and vote for people that have done and will do immeasurable damage to this country and the world. The net effect of their extremism is not even comparable to this chick. But if we disagree here then that\'s fine there is no inconsistency on either side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If she had their platform size, she would do the same. And she is trying to grow her platform to do so. But I’m fine to agree to disagree as well.\n\n*[Cont\'d]*\n\n&gt; even if you wanted that to be your position I don\'t think being an edgelord troll is \"reprehensible.\" you could pick a lot of words but I wouldn\'t personally use reprehensible\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You don’t think spitting on homeless people makes you a reprehensible person?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; again it depends on the context. is she an america firster who believes brown people don\'t belong on American soil so she spirs on them to demonstrate her vitriol? or is she a socially awkward tourette\'s troll bitch outrage farming to draw attention to her onlyfans? the intention matters. I saw some clips in which she was spitting on very much *not* homeless people, I would assume if she spit on homeless people it\'s just more of the same gag but with a different target, not because she believes homeless people are second-class citizens who deserve to be spit on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\'m not defending her I literally didn\'t know who this person was 12 hours ago I\'m just saying I wouldn\'t draw conclusions about the fiber of her character based on what I\'ve seen and it sounds like Destiny didn\'t either\n\n---\n\n### Some are down bad\n\n&gt; [Based as fuck.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/_/nkw1gbx/) Also the tattoos look so bad. I have no idea who these people are but she\'s cool with me\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; she will not fuck you, lil bro\n\n---\n\n### Some aren\'t sure if they\'re dating\n\n&gt; [Destiny now dating an actually insane person.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/_/nkw1uff/) Seems like if you can scale people up from 1 to 10 on crazy she would be 9-10 and compared to her Lav would be 3-4. Actually demented person. So disappointing. It better be a prank or some shit\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Confirmed dating? All I\'ve seen so far is one picture of them together.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I guess I\'m hopeful this is a \"he just met her, he doesn\'t know her skeletons\" situation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this was 2-3 years ago, I would agree with you. But there have been countless times where it was later revealed that a girl that he was \"just friends\" with was someone that he was also fucking.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It\'s extremely obvious he wants to fuck her. No way in hell destiny is going after a nazi, homeless abuser, freak unless he wants to fuck them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I\'d also like to add that it was, at times, obvious that destiny was fucking chicks he brought on stream. Lauren southern being a prime example.\n\n---\n\n### Destiny is just an ugly version of Hasan\n\n&gt; [destiny is a great example of survivorship bias manifesting within 1 single person](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1odr212/empathchan_called_darius_the_f_and_n_slurs_a/nkyav7d/)\n\n&gt; political beliefs aside, he\'s just ugly hasan who tells you he\'s a bad person instead of hiding it.\n\n&gt; He\'s bad but always better than the people criticizing him! That\'s the MO, dman has stuck to that since 2016\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; They should ban her from events and he shouldn\'t retweet, outside of that there is nothing harmful or unethical about any supposed private interaction and I have yet to see anyone make a convincing argument about that specifically. If you think \'he\'s bad\' why engage with the community?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\'m not talking about this one single event\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I engage with him/this community for the political conversations and basic new/social media stuff. I agree with alot of his political views I just think he\'s bad person interpersonally or whatever lol like I wouldn\'t want to be his friend and would probably think less of any of my friends if they showed up with a \"destiny\" type person lol\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\'s got bad vibes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, if you don\'t think there\'s something unethical in the situation I described and your only point is \"I think destiny is a bad person\" that\'s fine but you can\'t be surprised I assumed this comment is in reference to the subject of the thread itself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ok lol\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the \"destiny\" type person you were talking about\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  yeah this weird need they have to defend everything destiny does in a very cold and calculated way is so obviously missing the point its almost satirical lol they are doing the thing!\n\n----\n\nPlenty more in the linked thread, which has over 1000 comments as of this posting.', 'livejamie', 'SubredditDrama', 'https://reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1of6m3z/destinys_community_struggles_with_him_staying/', 2387, 1359, '2025-10-24 19:12:13', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

I knew him and I remeber he made small games or worked on them. Therefore, it was not suspicious when he asked me if I wanted to test his game. I said yes and he send me the game. I placed it into my AntiVirus Software, it told me \"Everything is fine, no threat\". I tried to run it but it didnt do anything. He then told me I have to run it as admin cause Unity needs that. I googled that and Google even told me it mostly doesnt. Well, I ran it anyway. \n\nThe next second I saw a small command window without text, at the same time, my anti virus software reported \"New exception created\" and for a short time which folder it accessed: \"...AppData/Google/Chrome/Cookies\". It did somehow create an exception to gain access to my browser. In the anti virus software, it tells me \"that access my lead to passwords and user data\".\n\nIt was too late, I saw how my Discord logged me out. I instantly knew what happend. I was shocked, embarrassed, angry and paniced. Has a small panic attack I think. I was able to gather my thoughts and knew: \"You have to do everything now as fast as possible\". I tried to log into discord with my old PW, it didnt work. So I requested a new one. For some reason the mail didn\'t work so I used my Phone. This worked and I got an Email to reset it. I did and I was logged in for a second before being logged out again. I got an email \"Your Password got changed, if it wasnt you, click here\" so I clicked and reseted it again. After that, I instantly created new backup codes and speedrunned to make a new 2FA-Connection. \n\nIn the meantime, I checked he actually send me a message, offering me a deal to het my data back, also showing my Passwords of my PW-Manager I believe l, in PLAIN text, also my Google Photos and my Google Account. I thought that\'s it but that was his mistake. I didn\'t knew till then he was in my Google Account, so I went in there, logged out of every device, also generated new backupcodes, deleted all browser history and changed the password again. \n\nHe changed my birthday to 2017 to make the account delete itself after 2 weeks. I had gained control over my accounts, however changed them all again. Wrote them down on paper cause I going paranoid, took my PC off the Internet and ran anti virus software. Google and Discord did not notify my that someone logged into my accounts, only the password change did notify me. The anti virus software failed by being manipulated and Google didn\'t notify. Usually I get a full-screen box, asking if this location is allowed to log in or not.\n\nAnti virus software: Norton\nGame or maleware name: NightsThread.exe\nPhone number which contacted me started with: +62\nHe had 1 hoir access to my Google and Discord Account \n\nI fell into a trap like a noob... I won\'t forget the feeling so I hope it never happens to me again.\n\nActions I took: Report to police, cleaned my .../User/ folder cause new one appeared, removed the exceptions in the anti virus software, changed passwords for important accounts like banking, google, social media. I never responded to him.\n\nI wanted to to post this even though its embarrassing to me. The account of my friend got corrupted just like mine did. I trused my anti virus software and google. Why on earth are my passwords plain text in my local storage?? \n\nWhat else could I do to prevent further damage?

It’s insane that the chat report feature has such easy ways of abuse.\n\nUPDATE: Another Huge German YouTuber/Streamer Paluten (The biggest German YouTuber views wise) was also banned, but he apparentlys knew the German Mojang representitive somewhat personally(?) and he got unbanned again that way. Of course, this isn\'t achievable for the average person, but this is potentially now a path for most of the Streamers to get unbanned. Obviously, one guy shouldn\'t be responsible for fixing this broken system.\n\nUPDATE 2: All accounts were apparently unbanned, waiting on more info right now.

I was there for a couple of hours and took a little nap for, like, four hours because I was tired. After I woke up, I went home and my husband was being a little off and seemed kind of upset/unhappy. I\'m like, what\'s up and he says, I\'m being nice for someone who just texted what I did. I sent my kids upstairs and started asking what the hell was going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says I sent him divorce texts. I\'m shocked because I never did that, which I let him know. I even showed him my phone, which did not show any such texts. He then shows me his messages under my name, and apparently I want a divorce. I was bamboozled because not only did I not think it, but I definitely did not text that. This affected him a little more because we had a fight the previous night, but we have a tradition of sorts, which is reassuring each other that we still love and care but are just upset at the moment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m only adding this because I said something along those lines in the morning before I left, which I brought up when I was defending myself against the text I supposedly sent. He then says I had done something similar previously. This is in reference to when I was pregnant and had some pseudo bipolar symptoms, which have since been mostly resolved. I\'ve only done this once, and it wasn\'t even on the same level; I just kind of used to have terrible mood swings. Also, this was only during the pregnancy; I have no bipolar diagnosis or anything like that. That whole journey was kind of traumatic and is not a pleasant memory for me, which he is aware of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, after we bicker for a little bit, I decide to call my sister and explain what was happening, and then I\'m like, hey, can you pull up your house footage from while I was there this morning?\" We\'re on facetime, and we fast forward to when I went to sleep. The outlet in the room I was in wasn\'t working, so I had plugged my phone in the dining area to charge while I slept. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe see my 16-year-old niece on my phone; she was on it off and on for like 2.5 hours, smiling and giggling. I\'m upset, and her mom is upset. She calls her and asks if she touched my phone while I was there, and she lies and says no. She asks her again two more times if she touched my phone, and she says she didn\'t. The laptop is faced away from her, and I believe she didn\'t realize I was on the phone or that we both already saw what she did. It was after my sister started trying to send me the footage, which I had initially asked for, that she saw that her mom had already seen what happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe started apologizing and saying it was supposed to be a prank and she didn\'t mean anything by it. She called out to me too with apologies while she was crying. My sister is one of those silent when angry types, so she wasn\'t saying anything. I did not even know what to say at all at this time because why would she even think this was a fun prank, not to mention going into my phone without my permission. How she knows my password, I\'m not sure because it\'s not simple or related to me. I had initially promised I would sponsor her 17th birthday, which is next month. She had previously also asked for a new PC, which I got, but it\'s supposed to be a surprise. I also happen to be her godmother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is, will I be overreacting if I take all these gifts back and keep a distance from her? Is it overkill? I feel maybe I\'m punishing her for the way my husband reacted and brought up something traumatic for me. Also maybe his response is justified because he thought the texts were from me, and then I was all smiley and sweet when I came back. I\'m confused on how to proceed, but reddit has previously helped figure stuff out before, so I decided to turn to them again. Sorry if this was too lengthy, and let me know if there\'s anything I have to clarify. Thanks.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Irishwatcher**\n\n&gt;The most important thing first is to make sure your husband knows what really happened and have your sister send him the video feed showing your niece on your phone.  After you make sure he believes you, I would then go scorched earth with your niece.  Actions have consequences and she needs to understand that now and that is in no way any type of prank with most pranks. The person is there to see the outcome and say ha ha your niece would’ve had no idea what was going on so how would she even know the prank that was successful or not.   And obviously, I would change on my passwords on everything including banking apps\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;He was present when I asked for the footage, and he has seen it too.\n\n**OOP Updated the next Day June 7, 2025/Same Post**\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you, everyone, for all the comments and advice. It is incredibly appreciated. All these happened yesterday; I only posted because I was slightly conflicted. To answer common questions in the comments: Yes, I slept for four hours at my sister’s house; she’s my sister, and we do stuff like that. I didn’t say I was tired from what I helped her with; I was simply just tired. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth my sister and niece weren’t aware of my husband’s and my fight from the previous night. Niece also was not aware of the full extent of my mental health struggles from the pregnancy. Niece wasn’t texting for 2.5 hours straight; she was on and off the phone. I assume she got off it when she thought she would be caught. Apparently, she has known my password for a while now; she learned it from looking over my shoulder at a family event from a couple of months back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Also, according to my sister, she has gone into my phone before, at least three times that she fessed up to. She has transferred money to herself, taken videos and pictures off it, gone through my texts with my kids and some other relatives, stolen other people’s numbers, gotten passwords for my streaming services that they didn’t own, and gone through my other texts with my husband. And yes, there’s very nsfw stuff in there. My husband is okay. We talked, and he apologized for how he spoke to me, but I told him I totally understood why he would say what he said. I also apologized for my reaction. We are okay on our front and decided we were both justified given what we both individually knew. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the niece, the only other thing she did according to her, was transfer more money. I checked my recently deleted texts, and there was nothing suspicious there, but I don’t know if you can delete texts from recently deleted. She also said she thought the prank would be funny because there was no way my husband would believe all that stuff she texted because, according to her, he loves me too much and we have a perfect relationship. In the texts, he had only replied that we would talk when I got home and that he wasn’t going to have that conversation with me over texts. This girl went all the way to add that ‘I’ would send the papers in a couple of days and talk about the kids with lawyers. I can’t explain how absolutely pissed I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe plan is to go absolutely no contact with her after learning of all the other stuff she did. There will be no birthday and no PC. Someone said to put up a post saying if anyone got a questionable text from me in the last 24 hours to let me know. I did that; no one had reached out yet, so I’m hoping it was just my husband. I’m getting my money back; I checked, and in total she has sent over $700 to herself that I wasn’t aware of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe did not send it in bulk, just little bits here and there. I guess I did not catch on because I do send her money often, and I do have quite a bit in my account, so it wasn’t obvious. Her mother will send the money to me from her daughter\'s savings later this weekend. I told her mother about the suggestions you guys gave on community service and therapy. I’m lowkey scared for her future relationships and college life. She would not have any electronic devices for the rest of the summer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I do not want to lay eyes on her in the near future. Oh, and yes, she has done this before to one of her friends whom she is still friends with. I don’t know why anyone would remain friends with someone like that. This hurt a lot because I love this child so much; I was more present than her father the first 11 years of her life. She used to come to me for her struggles and problems and all that teenage stuff. She had her first period at my house. Her other cousins on her dad’s side are jealous of our relationship, for goodness sake. She was my favorite one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t really care what her mom does about all these; I just want my money back and to never speak to her for now. In the future, I might be open to some contact. I blocked her number, so she sent me a long email which I haven’t read yet, and her mom also brought a handwritten apology letter from her to my husband. My sister is aware of my decisions and has apologized for her daughter\'s behavior. My mom is also aware of the situation now. I have no doubt it is about to become an extended family problem. Anyway, that’s that for now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will update if anything else comes from this. Again, thanks to everyone that contributed with comments and DMs.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Scenarioing**\n\n&gt;***\"There will be no birthday and no PC.\"***\n\n&gt;Will there be police for all the differnt crimes?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;We have decided not to go the legal route.

Right now, we’re still going through resulting situations from all these, so I’ll just give what I have for now. I don\'t know if I\'m adding this update right. If I am, good; if not, I\'m sorry, and the first part of this is on my profile. \n\nFirst, I’ll answer common questions. A lot of people seem to be hung up on the 4-hour nap a lot. I am a sleeper. I love to sleep. I sleep at her place all the time; it’s not that deep, but it is probably why I am in this predicament anyway. Another thing is the cameras; in this day and age, I think people should have cameras in their houses. I have them at my place too; I got them installed after I hired my first babysitter, and I have figured out a lot of stuff from reviewing footages. It does not have to be in every room, just common areas.\n\nOnto the actual update. My niece came over to formally apologize to my husband and me. She cried throughout the entire apology. She said she hadn’t done it to anyone else, just me. I kept asking why, and she just kept repeating she was sorry. My husband thinks she probably thought I would be the one to forgive the easiest. I told her exactly why I was upset and how she had hurt me and my husband. I told her I would be going low contact with her for the foreseeable future. I let her know I cancelled the birthday and any gift she would have gotten. The only thing she would get from me is her first college tuition, which I had promised a long time ago. I’m doing this more as a courtesy to my sister than anything else. I know it would help her a great deal. Niece will also not be allowed in my house for the foreseeable future. Her dad also reached out and apologized to us. We have decided not to go the legal route as a favor to my sister’s family. They have a lot on their plate right now, and I would not want to make their life more complicated.\n\nDuring this conversation, she denied having a crush on my husband, as a lot of you guys had suspected. I asked if she felt I wasn’t being attentive enough to her, and she said no. Oh, and I found out she had texted two other people; it was nothing serious, but still. Some people were asking if she had mental issues; to my knowledge she has none. She was tested when she was younger, and she had none. She kind of liked drama in elementary and middle school, but nothing worrisome. We told her she would be starting therapy, to which she said nothing was wrong with her. My husband then said people who are okay wouldn’t do what she did. Her mother added that it was just to help her go about things in more normal ways. Also, the PC will be going to my brother’s son, who will be going to college this fall; it will probably be more useful to him.\n\nMy kids have since blocked her. She was made to get a new job; she previously worked for her uncle on her dad’s side, but they thought it would be better if she worked somewhere entirely different with no family relations. My mom has been upset with my husband and me; she said we were going too far and that she was just a kid. One of my uncles and two of my aunts are on her side and have been harassing us with texts and calls. My sister and her husband are on our side though.\n\nOver a couple days following the conversation at my place, my mom has been updating us that my niece was depressed, cries every day, and keeps repeating that she did not mean it, everyone hates her, and is no longer speaking to her. That her second mom no longer loves her or cares about her. She says they have taken away everything from her.\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING!!!! SELF-HARM**\n\n \n\nOn the 12^(th), my niece attempted to take her life. Her older sister found her. She left a note apologizing for all the hurt she caused and said we would all be better without her. She wrote that she would be better off gone than have to live her life knowing I hate her and that my kids do not want to be close to her anymore. She wrote a lengthy letter actually, but I can’t fit it all in here. She currently is still in the Peds ICU, as she had done some extensive damage to herself. I have been to the hospital every day since I found out.\n\nMy husband says maybe we went too far. My mother says she will curse me and never speak to my family if I do not make things go back to the way they were. My children think it is their fault and are willing to apologize for blocking and cutting her off. I am more conflicted than I was a week ago. It’s like everyone is looking to me to fix it all. I don’t really know what to do right now. My sister keeps saying I don’t have to do anything, but she has been bawling. My niece’s other siblings have all texted me variations of ‘I know she hurt you, but forgive and forget because she almost died.’ My extended family has been a lot too: ‘you’re a grown woman waging war on a 16-year-old,’ ‘you are evil and don’t deserve good things,’ ‘I hope your life ends up like what you’re giving niece.’ I have gotten messages from strangers too because my sister’s mother-in-law posted on FB that I was a bitter woman hurting her grand-daughter and a bunch of other things.\n\nSo, the past three days have been mentally miserable for me. Not to take away from what my sister’s family is going through, but I am sad, heartbroken, confused, and just tired. Please send prayers my sister’s way. I’m not sure how all this is going to end, but I’ll let everyone know when she’s out of the ICU and whatever else happens. Thank you for all your advice and supportive words. I appreciate it all.\n\n[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/pDLWnPJjub)  **June 22, 2025**\n\nThank you everyone for your comments, DMs, and advice. I’ve gotten a lot of DMs and comments for an update, so I’ll tell you what’s happened since the last update.\n\nFirst, I want to give the biggest shoutout to my sister (niece’s mom); she can’t see this, but I just want those words out there. I have said them to her too, but I want you guys to hear it too. She has not only been my biggest defender against all the flying monkeys despite what she is going through, but she has also been so good to me. She stood up for me to my mother and relatives. She also counterposted on FB after all that stuff from her mother-in-law.\n\nSecondly, I want to address those asking how my niece did it and how she was found. She ingested something harmful; we’re not exactly sure of what it was, but it was a mixture of cleaning supplies. Her oldest sister found her on the bathroom floor. She was extubated on the 16^(th) after she got a whole bowel irrigation and one-time hemodialysis because she had given herself an acute kidney injury. She was intubated for 26 hours. She is now out of the ICU and is now on the peds medsurg unit. The same evening she left the ICU, she had to be put on a 72-hour psych hold and will be transferring to an inpatient psych facility when she is medically cleared. She did get a psych evaluation, and so far, she has been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and histrionic personality disorder. The psychiatrist says she might also have borderline personality disorder, but that would be determined better at the psych facility.\n\nI am still low contact with my niece; I’ve only had one phone call with her in which I told her I loved her and we’re getting her help. Her therapist said to reinsert my presence in her life but make no promises like “if you get help, we’ll be okay” or something like that. She says since I’ve previously been a positive presence, it might help to have me in the background while she heals. She gave suggestions for my ‘background presence,’ like letters, phone calls, or visits if I feel like it. I am not to give her any gifts or rewards. I haven’t decided which one to go with yet. I might just send a letter monthly.\n\nMy sister did look through my niece’s phone and found no nsfw pictures of me or my husband, but she did delete the streaming apps my niece got access to. I know some people were worried about her taking those photos. I know she saw them, though.\n\nMy children are in therapy, both individual and family. My husband and I finally explained the entire thing in detail to them, including my struggles during my first pregnancy and how niece’s prank was a trigger. The therapist helped us facilitate the whole thing better. Niece’s other siblings are in therapy now too. The oldest has since apologized for her texts and harsh voicemails. We have also sent the kids to my in-laws for the next three weeks. Therapy will be online. I also blocked my mother on their phones; they are to speak to none of my relatives for now. My mother doubled down and started coming at my children via texts and calls; that\'s one of the reasons we sent them away.\n\nMy BIL, niece’s dad, broke down while she was still comatose and did a full 180. He left me a long voicemail saying I was hurting his baby girl and ripping her away from him. I did not like him when he first started dating my sister, and he says I was using my niece to break him because I hated him. If something happens to her, he won’t forgive me. This is a complete opposite of his stance before; I don’t know if it\'s grief or his mom in his ears. He is now at odds with his wife because she agrees with keeping the consequences we all agreed on, but the husband says to relent. My family and my other sisters are trying to be her (niece’s mom) support in every way that we can.\n\nI have had to completely cut my mother off from my family, including some of my aunts and uncles. My dad is divorced from my mother and lives on the other side of the country. He is on my side with this whole thing. I have two brothers, and they’re both on my mom’s side, while all my sisters are on my side.\n\nMy mother sent me a very devastating text that I’ll just copy and paste here because I don’t even know if I can explain it. “Aria, you are the most disgraceful child I have ever birthed; I curse the day you were put in my arms. Your life will never know peace as long as you never give peace to CeCe. You’re so vile, and you will go to hell for causing this amount of harm to your sister’s family. You are no daughter of mine, and I do not claim you. Do not call me your mother. Keep your unclean children away from me too. If you come close to me, I’ll strangle you and feed you toilet cleaners (how niece attempted)”. What kind of mother sends this to her child. I took a screenshot, blocked that number, and printed off a copy of the text. This devil incarnate of a woman proceeded to email me two days after to tell me to send my share of money for remodeling her house. Yeah, like a cursed child would do that. I simply blocked her email too. I don’t even know why she called my children unclean; I had them all post-marriage and with one man.\n\nThis has been the longest month of my life, and it isn’t even over yet. I had a panic attack the other day because of everything. This darling man that I am married to has been my biggest rock and support; I genuinely do not know what I would do without him. How I would repay him for all this, I do not know. I spend most days just crying. My mental health is suffering, my work is suffering, and I am just tired.\n\nI know this was super long, so if you’ve read all this, thank you. Thank you for sticking with me and holding me up with your words and virtual presence. You all probably see this often, but I genuinely want to thank each and every one of you. I can’t wait for all this to be over so I can get some normalcy back and be able to breathe well again.\n\n**NEW UPDATE**\n\n[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/VFAfXgFdhp)  **Oct 23, 2025**\n\nHey everyone, it’s been a hot minute. I think this is how you update posts, right? I’m not sure. I genuinely did not plan on updating, but there’s been several DMs and requests for updates, so I decided to, since there’s been a couple happenings and things are a little more settled now.\n\nFirst, I’m not American and don’t live in America. I don’t know if that clears up anything, but there were a couple questions and comments regarding that. Again, too many people were caught up on the nap from my initial post, and I don’t really understand why that is a bizarre thing to people. I took naps at my sister’s house. Here’s another shocker: I’ve also spent nights there. Wowzah, how despicable. Another thing was people saying I deserved all that because of a different post on my profile that happened a while before the niece event, I really hope you never get yourself in a pickle and need input from people. And to the ‘it’s AI’ and ‘it’s fake’ people, I wish, I really, really wish all that was an elaborate fake situation.\n\nOver to niece, her birthday has come and gone. She spent her 17^(th) birthday in a psych facility, unfortunately; maybe they’ll make up with her 18^(th) next year. Thankfully, she suffered no adverse effects from what she did, maybe except trauma. No, I did not give her the gifts, and there was no grand party. She’s out of the psych facility and home with her family now. The final mental health diagnosis is ADHD, HPD, and depression, no BPD, no autism. I got some DMs to get a second opinion because those diagnoses are not usually made for teenagers. I relayed that to my sister and niece did get a second set of evaluations at the facility, and this is what they came up with. I had no conversations with the doctors and have no clue how it was done; this is just what my sister has told me. I visited her there twice, just short conversations assuring her I still loved her but was just hurt by her actions. My first visit was in the presence of her therapist, and the other was with my sister. I will not remove my presence from her life, as I still care for and love her; I am hopeful that we will rebuild our relationship to where it was before all this or at least close to what it was. She has her phone privileges back, and she texts me sometimes, to which I respond (don’t be upset with me; her therapist and mine said it was okay).\n\nMy kids and husband are okay; my older twins have reestablished their relationship with the niece, but the younger set are still salty, and we are not going to coerce them into doing anything they do not want. My sister and her husband kind of separated for, like, three weeks because she was siding with me, and this almost broke me, to be honest. I genuinely wanted to give in and apologize, which I know all of you here would have been mad at. It just felt like everything spiraled out too fast. Too many people were getting involved, too many people were getting hurt in different ways, and I started feeling like it was too much, and maybe I should have just scolded her and gotten past it. But my therapist and dad helped me hold strong. Especially earlier, after I visited my niece in the hospital and just saw her state, I couldn\'t help but feel it was all my fault. I couldn’t tell you how many panic attacks I had during that time; I even thought I was going to check myself into rehab too. My dad even had to fly in to stay with us for a bit. My sisters and I have gotten so much closer, so that’s a positive from all that.\n\nMy extended family has had too many fallouts since then; a lot came to light. I no longer speak to our eldest brother and my mother, who I have a protective order against now. Short story, she tried to do something to my youngest, which I don’t think I can openly talk about yet. My BIL has also apologized for how he acted. His mother is a different story, and she isn’t allowed in their home anymore. She only gets supervised calls to her grandkids now.\n\nThis has been an intense couple of months for everyone in my family, both extended and nuclear. I kid you not, everyone was involved; everyone had things to say. I got emotional whiplash so many times, and I think my niece might not be the only one with mental disorders. All my mother’s children might all have a little something because, my goodness, was it a lot. Including myself, to be honest, but I’m not ready to confront that journey yet. I will in the future at some point, maybe.  \n\nWe’re all healing and getting better. My poor husband has been through so much emotionally this year; I’m so grateful for him and wish I could just take it all away from him. He deserves better. My children have been champs through this, especially my younger twins. I did not expect the amount of emotional maturity they showed, and I am so proud of them. Thank you all for the DMs and good wishes. I saw my story was posted on YouTube and TikTok, so thank you for the comments there as well. There won’t be any other updates from me unless something outrageous happens. I\'m open to answering questions in the comments. \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ojpy9f/wibta_if_i_go_lc_with_my_niece_and_take_back_her/', 2810, 449, '2025-10-30 04:02:08', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

(This is a very long post that I can’t really condense into a TL;DR).\n\nThe people I will mention in this are my mum, Jen - 50, my step-dad, Brian - 56, my brother, Tom - 23, and my sister, Ruth - 26.\n\nFor background, Jen and Brian have been together since I was 11.

None of our other immediate relatives ever mentioned him to us, either.\n\nThe day Jen asked us, Ruth was sat next to me and asked to be excused to her bedroom. Tom was not home to have an input. I was stuck by myself with Jen, who did not seem to understand how she completely blindsided us. She had no interest in answering my question about why she had not told us. Her only interest was knowing if we accepted this stranger moving in. Brian moved in the following week.\n\nAfter Brian moved in, there were several times where both he and Jen threatened to move away without me, Tom and Ruth. They would say “If you don’t like it we (they) will get a new house and start over”. This threat could be in relation to something like Brian telling me I shouldn’t be anywhere in the house except for my bedroom and me standing up for myself.\n\nI used to get called “stupid” by Brian a lot. If I did something he didn’t like, such as finish my homework before going to dinner, he would say “only someone this stupid wouldn’t think to eat first” Any grievance I had with Brian was never acknowledged by Jen. If I raised an issue with her she would deflect and change the subject. Brian would cause a lot of problems knowing that there were no consequences for him.\n\nBrian never concealed the fact that he wanted Jen and only Jen. We were her “baggage” that he only had to put up with for so many more years. Tom, Ruth and I were no longer taken on “family holidays”. The last one we got to go on was when I was my Godmother’s bridesmaid and she had a destination wedding. I was 10. Jen and Brian would go on 3 holidays a year without us.\n\nLiving under that roof was the loneliest I had ever felt. The second I became of age, I bought my first apartment and moved on. No more Brian, no more Jen. Tom and Ruth wanted to come with me but Jen wouldn’t allow it, and honestly, I don’t know how I was to fight for them. I was working long shifts, sometimes nights. Though Ruth was a year younger than me, Tom was not. I doubt a court would appoint a fresh 18 year old as their guardian with Jen in the picture.\n\nOne thing I did leave in Jen’s care was my valuable book collection. I won’t disclose exactly how much it is worth, but it is in the 7 figure range. Some of these books were my inheritance. I was always told that they are to be looked after, never to be played with, and has to be stored correctly.\n\nI couldn’t do that in my apartment so Jen continued to keep them for me. I had no reason to distrust her with them.\n\nEarlier today, I called Tom as I was travelling home from seeing a friend. Tom mentioned that he had gone to Jen’s house to collect some things.\n\nBecause he was there, I asked Tom to find out if Jen had managed to get the remainder of my books authenticated - She and I had spoken about doing so a few weeks prior.\n\nTom asked Brian about my books, and then Brian laughed and said “What books? My books?”. Tom said “No, her books that you have been looking after”. Brian then repeated “My books”. I was listening to this through Tom’s headphones so I told him to get Brian to clarify. Tom asked Brian what he meant by “His books”. Brian said “They’re ours now. We bought them”.\n\nMy heart sank the moment I heard him say that. Jen was not home. I tried calling her - no answer. Eventually she called me back a couple of hours later, but not before Brian called me a “pathetic liar”, and also spoke ill of Ruth and made claim to her books - which she had in fact sold years ago, still insisting mine were also his property.\n\nTo confirm, I never sold anyone a single book. They did not buy me any books. All the books in my collection are to be sold at a future date or passed down to my children. Brian and Jen never gave me a single penny so I can confirm this is not the case. Jen was unwilling to confront him about it. I am not allowing them to steal part of my children’s inheritance.\n\nJen agreed that she never bought my books, but Brian refuses to give them back to me.\n\nI told Jen that her inadequacy as a parent, failure to reprimand Brian over the years, and her lack of love for her own children has meant this moment was a long time coming. I said something along the lines of “You neglected me. You allowed him to take my happiness away for years. You let him walk all over me… I will not let you steal from my children… If this is how it has to be, I will take you to the cleaners... I will report you both for theft, I will sue you for everything I can, I will cut you out of my life again. You mean nothing to me.”\n\nI am not in need of legal advice on this - I have a Lawyer, I just to know if I was out-of-line for what I said to Jen? I was very emotional at the time.\n\nThank you if you read all of this!\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I don\'t think you were out of line - they were sucky parents. You told the truth.\n\nI have to ask though - is it documented that the books were left directly to you? Do you have a copy?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have payment receipts for the authentications as I have to send them abroad to get them done.\n&gt; \n&gt; I keep a spreadsheet so I can update it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everything has been paid for by me and I can prove my ownership. I also have messages from Jen where we discuss my collection (including the number of books, their names, value, etc).\n\n**Commenter 2:** I would take the documents to the police station and ask them to provide an escort while you get your property back from your previous home. Don’t give any warning that you are going to do this.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** You’re actually required to give notice about collecting property because it is called a ‘Breach of Peace’ and access has to be given by those living at the property.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of this being theft, they could retrieve it for me with a warrant, but then it would probably become evidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Civil vs criminal.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Do you have a list of every single book? Are they first editions? I hope you get them back.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I keep a spreadsheet that I regularly update with all their details - identification numbers, value, location, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some are first editions, some are valuable and rare comics. It is a mix of a collection.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; **Commenter 4:** Some of them will be missing if you don\'t move them. How about renting a temperature controlled storage unit and moving them permanently?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seriously, don\'t trust him or your flakey mom.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; **OOP:** I bought a house and had storage made to specific requirements so that I can move my books to my property. That’s partly why I wanted to know if she had sorted the other books for me - I’d rather move them all in one-go and avoid seeing Brian.\n\n**Commenter 5:** NTA obviously but I think we all want to hear some backstory about how a teenager acquired a seven-figure book portfolio. Assuming we\'re not talking Pakistani rupees or something\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I think I mentioned above - Mostly inheritance. I added to my collection over the years.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wasn’t a teenager when I inherited them, I was a child. Due to me being a child, Jen had physical care of them, but I was allowed to see them at any time and she respected my wishes when it came to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I got my first job at 16, I had them valued by an Appraiser.\n&gt; \n&gt; The value of books, especially the kind I have, appreciate over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I’m from the UK - GBP.\n\n**Commenter 6:** Nta but you were incredibly foolish to leave the books there.\n\n&gt; **Commenter 7:** She could not take care of them where she was moving. She had no reason to believe her mother would not care for them.Apparently Brian had not shown that he would steal her property.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 6:** She wrote that Brian abused her all throughout childhood and her mother let it happen. Of course she should not have trusted them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** I didn’t trust Brian, I trusted Jen.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; She had never withheld any of my books from me. If I asked for any, she would hand them over to me immediately.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; The family home has the appropriate storage for them. Jen was a failure of a parent in so many other ways, but when it came to my books, she wouldn’t dare.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian wanted to store some of his collection with mine but Jen refused because she didn’t want him having access to them. She was aware that he would try to pressure me to sell him some of my books, and this is one of the few things she did speak up about.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Even yesterday she was saying that she did not buy them and that they are mine, but she will not stand up to Brian who is claiming ownership of them. That is the issue.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; If she fails to do that, then she is as guilty as he is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/K2FJlf5Lpi): **October 3, 2025 (2.5 weeks later)**\n\nAITA for telling my parents that I will “take them to the cleaners”?: The Update\n\nI am sorry for leaving things so long. I was busy with the situation, then travelling, and I thought it would be best to leave things until it was fully resolved. It has been a little over two weeks but it has felt like an eternity.\n\nI’ll start off by saying there is good news and “bad”news.\n\nThe good news: I got my books back - All of them. Unscathed. They are physically in my possession and will remain in my care indefinitely.\n\nThe “bad” news: I did not take Jen and Brian to the cleaners.\n\nUltimately, my goal was to get my books back, no matter the route I had to take to do so. I’m sure you’ll mostly agree that it was a good outcome either-way, even if I am not suing my parents.\n\nI’ll keep the rest of this as brief as possible.\n\nAfter speaking with Tom, I had already contact my Lawyer to set things in motion. They had advised that they would contact Jen and Brian as a matter of urgency.\n\nNot long after speaking with me, Jen had contacted Ruth to try and convince her to get me to speak with her. It was only going to be her attempt to get me to back-down. I do not bluff. She knows this.\n\nRuth said she told Jen that she hopes I do follow through with things, and then she ended the call. Jen tried to call back, Ruth ignored her. Then it was Tom’s turn.\n\nJen tried to get Tom to talk to me and Ruth. Jen was still in agreement that my books were mine, but Brian still was not having any of it and Jen was not putting him in his place.\n\nTom said he agreed with what I was doing. I was told that Brian was shouting obscenities about me in the background. Things like “Ungrateful b*tch”. You get the picture.\n\nTom told me they deserve it and so much more.\n\nMy Lawyer had contacted them on my behalf two days later. All contact with me was to go through the firm from then on.\n\nThis is what Jen told me happened after they were contacted as I was packing up (It was a one-sided discussion):\n\nShe told Brian that he needed to stop trying to claim my books. If he was intent on keeping them, he needed to make me an offer of their current value +30%, but if I said “no”, it means no. How honourable of her.\n\nBrian was still adamant he didn’t need to offer me anything because the books already belong to them and I won’t be getting anything. He also did not seem to think that I would win a legal battle against them, despite Jen confirming I had everything that meant they were guaranteed to lose.\n\nA couple more days later, My Lawyer said that Jen reached out to them on her own, and said that she wanted me to retrieve all of my books.\n\nI had already made them aware that Brian was an issue because of his presence at the family home, but she assured them that he would be gone for the whole day (out of our City).\n\nSome days ago, I arranged for suitable transportation for the books to my house. A few days ago, I went to collect the books.\n\nWhen I got to the family home, Brian’s car was not in the garage or front patio, which they always are whenever he is home, so I proceeded into the house. I know he would have tried to provoke me, even though I am not a violent person, because he wants to have a way to make me squirm.\n\nI walked right past Jen and went to where the books were (Brian has never been granted access by Jen so they were perfectly secure), and I loaded them all into the van. It took a while.\n\nBrian won’t notice they’re gone because he has never been able to get into that room and Jen probably won’t say anything. Even if she does, neither of them know my address.\n\nJen was talking to me throughout, trying to get me to sit with her to speak like adults. She was saying cliché things like she regrets how she treated me and blah, blah, blah.\n\nIf she had said all of this years ago, maybe I would have listened, but even now I had to retrieve my own possessions in secret because she couldn’t stand up for me as she should have. Words are empty.\n\nI did not say a word the entire time. My Lawyer said everything that needed to be said, including that as long as Jen and Brian do not try to falsely make claim to my books, the matter was resolved once they were returned to my custody.\n\nOnce I finished loading everything, I returned my keys to the family home. Jen tried to convince me to keep them, but I have no intent of returning there. The truth is that place stopped being the family home the day Brian moved in. I have zero happy memories of it. My old room makes me sad to think about because it is a constant reminder that it was the only place I was “permitted” to be.\n\nEven writing this hurts.\n\nI needed my parent to look out for me. She failed in all other aspects apart from these books.\n\nI wish Jen had loved me like a parent should.\n\nBut yes, I have my books back - That’s a good outcome.\n\nThank you for the earlier support on the previous post. That is all from me.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** That\'s a good update, OP. Your family is your siblings. I kind of feel bad for Jen, because she will soon find out she\'s alone in the world, the moment she realizes what kind of scum Brian is. But just a wee little bit bad.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She and Brian have their own child now. They got their wish, and I hope it was worth it.\n\n**Commenter 2:** NTA. Glad you got your books. I imagine Brian has browbeat your mother j to add him to the deed and leaving him everything if she passes first. I hope she realizes if she becomes ill and needs care, he won’t do it and I hope you won’t either.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Even if she does, she was never really my parent. They have their own child now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brian made it clear that we would not get anything from him once he dies (not that we expected or wanted anything). He would say “My children will get everything I have. You are not my children. Your mother will probably leave you something, but she will need to provide for our children first”. (Such a lovely man)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jen once told me that she wouldn’t add their biological children to her will because Brian will leave them everything he has.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either way it goes, I will be okay.\n\n**OOP on the descriptions of her books**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I have a mixed collection - first edition books and rare and valuable comics make up the majority.\n\n**Commenter 3:** What happened with your sister’s books? Were they indeed gone? Is she going to sue them? Would she have the same proof that you have? How did your mother keep the books away from him for all this time?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Ruth mentioned selling some to Jen and Brian years ago - maybe 10 now.\n&gt; \n&gt; She didn’t want to sell them, but she needed the money to move out. The only way Brian was going to allow Jen to give it to her was in exchange for some books. If I had known at the time, I would have given her the money myself. I found out years later.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are boxes of books that belong to Ruth still in the room. She said she will keep them there for now. I will help her to move them when the time comes.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ones Jen and Brian bought were removed long ago to his own storage.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a little difficult to explain how the room is, but the door is a heavy-weight security door. It has a “smart lock” and Brian never got access to it. Imagine a more regular looking safe-room. I think that is the easiest way to explain it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Entering the room triggers the security system (like going home and having to put the alarm code in). Jen never needed to use this room once we got older, so Ruth and I were permitted to change the code. This ensures that Brian could never enter without us knowing, even if Jen betrayed us by giving him the code to the door (which she never has).\n&gt; \n&gt; Jen upgraded the security after Brian moved in.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is, in essence, a multi-purpose panic room.\n&gt; \n&gt; I’m sorry, I don’t know how to explain it any better. I hope it is clear.\n\n**Commenter 4:** I\'m glad you got your books back and have you ever thought of going to either therapy or some form of counseling just someone to talk to about your parent\'s neglect\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Jen put me in therapy when I was a teenager, and I still do sessions now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing her face as I left made me feel empty. She looked sad, but I felt mostly nothing. Now I feel something.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will request some sessions with my therapist. Closure is best.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Editor\'s note: marking this concluded as OOP has deleted her account and she got her books back into her possession.

(446, 'reddit', '1o6fpa0', 'BF6 after 50+ Hours', 'Hello everyone, I hope you all are enjoying the launch just as much as I have!\n\nI want to start off by saying, I am one of those degenerate gamers, on launch I did a 24h stream after getting off work, took myself a little nappy poo and was back at it for another 18h. Its safe to say I am not a casual gamer and haven’t ever fit that category so keep that in mind as I type this out.\n\nIt’s been YEARS since I’ve been excited for a game to launch. I put 30+ hours into the closed/open beta and insta pre-ordered within the first 5h.\n\n\nI want to thank everyone who worked on the game for taking the time to step back, realize where things got fucked up with 2042 and brought the series back to where it belongs. We all live and learn….eventually *cough* COD *cough*.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n- GFX and Sound design, my goodness is it good! The game looks great, it sounds AMAZING. It doesn’t look like a reskinned 2042 and you can tell there was some serious time and effort put into making sure everything sounds great and looks better.\n\n- The marking system, you listened to the community in regards our little Doritos and being able to identify if someone is pinged only for you or your team etc.\n\n\nThe maps, there’s both good and bad here but the good is that they all feel different in their own way.\n\nThe bad/mediocre….\n\n- Bloom\n\nI know this is a big discussion at the moment and there are more and more clips coming out displaying how egregious the bloom is and the frustrations its bringing so I wont go into a full rant about it. I will however make a recommendation that hopefully can be seen and considered by the dev team.\n\nCurrently as it stands, if you as an assault pull the M433 out in the firing range and shoot at the furthest target, you’re hitting 1-2/5 shots… as an assault, where the M433 (yes even with proper attachments) is your characters primary tool of choice. Why is this a thing? Your character is supposed to be proficient with their primary tool.\n\nIf you do the same test with the M4A1 with base attachments you’re beaming that target 10 times over comparatively.\n\nMy recommendation is that each class gets a proficiency bonus to their proper weapon class overall reducing bloom. This sort of system is already in the game, its been heavily implemented when using Sniper Rifles on any class besides Recon.\n\nAssault – Big proficiency increase for using Assault Rifles, reducing the bloom, a little bump in reload speed and more control.\n\nEngineer – Big proficiency increase for using SMGs, increased RL reload speed or faster lock on times or similar.\n\nSupport, Big proficiency increase for LMGs, decreased reload times, faster recharge for supply boxes or similar.\n\nRecon – Tbh recon feels like its in a pretty good spot where it is right now and I wouldn’t recommend any changes.\n\nThis will incentivize players to use weapons of their class specialization without completely restricting them and creating a locked class situation.\n\nMaps\n\n- The maps are fairly decent, there is a lot of discussion around this topic as well so ill quickly give my .02 cents and leave it.\n\nThe maps each have their own feel and pace to them which is nice however, I don’t really feel excited to play on any one or more maps. None of them have a wow factor or anything that gets me excited to play one map over another. They’re all…mid and I think it’s the sizes overall. They are definitely smaller than other titles and seems to pull away from the core BF experience.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe challenges I think are in a good spot personally however, the rewards need to be worth the time and effort to do them.\n\nI have completed the PSR challenge (Deadeye 1&amp;2), it took close to 12-16 hours to complete and in return you get the PSR which is ultimately worse than the M2010 ESR. This is highly disappointing and while I would like to grind out the other weapon challenges, I fear that its going to result in the same feeling.\n\nEither reduce the challenge requirements to accommodate for the underperforming reward or ideally keep the requirements as they are and give those rewards a rework in stats. Nothing insane obviously but something. I.E. giving the PSR a base velocity increase to at least match the M2010 ESR with extended barrel would be huge and really incentivize and make unlocking/using the PSR worth the time and effort.\n\nWeapon Mastery\n\n- I can sympathize with the community that the weapon mastery grind is rough. I have yet to max out the M2010 ESR which is my primary weapon of choice with some bouncing around to other weapons depending on the map and what I am in the mood to play around with.\n\nI haven’t done the full in depth research but I heard (again I did not verify) that in order to master one weapon its ~3500 kills… in 50h, averaging 40-60 kills per game, im only sitting at around 2k kills.\n\nI understand the need for a goal and purpose but it is quite a lot just for one weapon and that is coming from someone who can log 8+ hours in a day after work. Let alone the players who can only afford to put 1-2 hours if that a day. I feel for you and I hope this gets changed in the future.\n\nAlso; who thought it was a good idea to give us 999 red dots and 6x scopes before we finally get an 8x and 10x on the sniper? Good lord man.\n\nDesync/NetCode/HitReg\n\n- I don’t even really know where to start with this one so its going to be short and sweet.\n\nThe netcode is definitely struggling, the amount of times ive died after I am well around a corner is more often than not. The amount of times ive seen an enemy come around a corner and either a. beam me in .2 seconds OR not shoot at all before I kill them is more often than not.\n\nReminds me of the first 2 days during the closed beta. Not as severe but there is an obvious issue there that needs to be addressed.\n\nConclusion\n\n- The game is great and I cant wait to get my hands on the BR (haven’t properly played a BR since PUBG) to experience the chaos in that mode.\n\nThere are some obvious bugs, however nothing game breaking which is huge and didn’t add them to the discussion because they’re going to get fixed sooner than later.\n\nThere are some changes that I am sure will be addressed over the next couple weeks/months to follow.\n\nJust wanted to give me &lt;null&gt; thoughts now that the honey moon phase is over for me and I don’t have the rose-tinted glasses on anymore.\n\nIf you made it this far and read everything, thank you as I know it was A LOT.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the game so far and tell me your most memorable experience so far!', 'DevNFPS', 'Battlefield', 'https://reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o6fpa0/bf6_after_50_hours/', 1721, 1472, '2025-10-14 13:35:54', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

My family owns a crossbow that we usually shoot at a target on our property. While my father got it, it\'s considered to be mine for use. I am quite skilled with the crossbow and have fired it innumerable times, and am very careful. It is not a killing weapon, but it\'s not a toy and shooting it in a critical place could be lethal. It didn\'t shoot actual arrows, but more like pencil sized darts with relatively sharp metal tips. I had brought friends over before, including my best friend (18m) to shoot at the target with me before with no issue. This is because I very clearly explain that it isn\'t a toy and to exercise caution. One day my friend called me up and asked if we could shoot the crossbow. Unfortunately I said yes.\n\nIn retrospect the warning signs were there from the start, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened that day. He showed up shortly after calling and I was there set up and ready for him. From the start he wanted to begin shooting the target, but I slowed him down and went over the protocol of how to fire it and how to put the safety on. He kept giving me quick responses of how he remembered how to do it, and I gave the demonstration myself. Now we had done this before, so it wasn\'t a complete red flag that he wanted to speed through instructions, but I wish my judgment was better. He fired it off a few times and hit the target with no issue. Then I went to grab more darts from the dart box which was BEHIND the direction of the target, essentially completely opposite to the line of fire. \n\nIt all happened in seconds: I felt a sharp thud hit my head and my vision go black for a moment, but there was no pain. I remember looking at my friend with the crossbow in hand and wide eyed as a deer. I began to scream as I instinctively pulled the pencil sized dart from my head. I have to say I may have been more in control than he was while I was bleeding from the head, as he froze in shock and I yelled at him to call 911 which he did. My adrenaline was through the roof and i didn\'t actually feel the injury but I knew I was bleeding. Very quickly both police and medics showed up on the scene and I was fully lucid, and understood that I hadn\'t sustained a serious injury, however, the place where I was hit was an inch between my eye and temple. . . I told the police it wasn\'t intentional as my friend could barely speak out of shock. I went to the hospital but was let out very quickly.\n\nIt\'s been a week and my friend called to ask if I was ok at the time I was in the hospital, but we haven\'t talked since then. There was so much dangerous stupidity from him that I can\'t understand how he had his safety off and had TURNED AWAY FROM THE TARGET, FACED ME, AND SHOT.

The left over was about half of the cake\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NTA. It\'s pretty normal to expect the leftovers to be yours when someone brings you a birthday cake.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I felt like crap haha she said so you are not sharing with a 5 year old ?\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment about sharing the leftovers with the five years old and get another birthday cake for himself** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** Why should I buy myself another cake ? I just wanted the left over of my birthday cake\n\n**The birthday cake flavor**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Parisian chocolate cake\n\n**Commenter 2:** If you’re expected to share your cake with all and sundry, why didn’t your wife buy you a bigger cake? That way, you could share with everyone and still be able to enjoy several pieces of the cake you were *gifted.* That “expectation” seems a little sus to me.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I asked my wife this since it was posted here a few times. She said originally her mom was supposed to sleep at our house that night but her sister needed help so mil decided to go there. Her mom decided to surprise the SIL and her son with the left over cake . She thought we all had a slice so she just grabbed the box to take it there. I don’t know their language so I can’t confirm if this was all a miscommunication/misunderstanding or it’s a cultural thing or they asked MIL to bring some cake\n\n**Commenter 3:** This is an Arabic hosting thing, as well as tyrannical MIL. Arabic mothers and grandmothers tend to fawn over boys and use girls for work. I personally knew a man who was breastfed until he was 5, while sisters were weaned at 6 months. Boys are emperors. Depending on the country, in the ME, if a guest admires something, the host gives it to him. In Saudi Arabia and Dubai, this goes to absurd lengths. Don’t complement someone’s watch in his home. He might feel obligated to give it to you. (This depends on socioeconomic level and class.) Once MIL grabbed your birthday cake, it became rude to take it back. She knew what she was doing. Get a replacement cake. In future, get a separate cake to either hide for leftovers, or send to in-laws’ “for the kids.”\n\n&gt; **OOP:** My wife was born in Dubai but her family is from Saudi\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; **Commenter 3:** Idk enough about saudi culture to say but i can tell you, this is not normal in my cultures. Its straight up rude and would start a family fight.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Thank you. This is very helpful. I understand cultural differences but I don’t appreciate being manipulated using “cultural thing”. In laws and I are finally civil ( they originally were against their daughter even dating me) and I try to be respectful as much as I can. I really don’t want to add extra stress on my wife but this incident bothered me so much\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Beneficial-Lab6495/s/FraCi1HqbG): **October 16, 2025**\n\nUpdate: MIL and my birthday cake drama\n\nI talked to my wife last night and told her that that I’ve decided not to have a birthday cake anymore. It seems to cause so much drama, so it’s easier if we just go to the bakery together, have a coffee, and share a slice of cake on the day instead. Thank you for your input\n\n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter:** Oof I feel so bad for you, though, that you have to compromise on your birthday now moving forward. But also seems like this is a good way to set a boundary for yourself to limit drama. Not sure what culture your MIL is from, but I’m guessing from a more collective culture? I lived in a country once where for example on your birthday you had to treat the entire office to lunch, unlike the US where everyone treats you for your bday lol\n\n**Commenter 2:** Maybe celebrate your birthday when MIL is not in your home.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She doesn’t live here. She is visiting Canada. Hopefully next time she comes at a different time\n\n**Commenter 3:** Perhaps your wife should purchase two birthday cakes and hide one in the back of the refrigerator. That way, your mother-in-law can feel like she\'s \"winning,\" and you can eat an entire 6-inch cake over the next couple of days.\n\n**Commenter 4:** This is not a cultural thing, this is your wife\'s family thing. I\'m from the middle east too. If you\'re happy with having the cake at the café, then yeah, your birthday. But I think it\'s rude for someone to just assume that they could take something from somebody else\'s house without asking. You don\'t owe your MIL an apology, your wife should have your back on this. But honestly, it\'s not a hill worth dying on, not a battle I\'d pick, but I still wouldn\'t apologize. It is just a cake, and it\'s easy to get, not a lot of people would care, but we don\'t all have to care about what YOU care about, and it is *your* birthday cake, that\'s kind of special, and it is fun to see it again the next day. I\'m sure your wife wouldn\'t like it if someone took something that\'s important to her without asking.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Editor’s note: marking this concluded because OOP has deleted his account and we won’t see any further updates**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1odthi9/mil_took_my_birthday_cake_should_i_apologize/', 2642, 455, '2025-10-23 04:00:05', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

I love my boyfriend very much and we have a great relationship, but there’s so many small day-to-day things he does (or doesn’t do) that accumulate and make me feel like I’m constantly being a nag, and it makes me want to end the entire relationship and just live alone. \n\nExamples: He gets home from work and takes his socks off right away, but always leaves them under the living room table (right where he took them off). He’ll cook a big meal in the kitchen and then tell me he cleaned everything up, but nothing is wiped down and all the dishes are just on the drying rack for me to put away. If I don’t put the dishes away they just sit there, completely dry, for days. I can’t do my laundry with his because he constantly leaves tissues or pens or random shit in his pockets that have ruined my clothes. He basically refuses to use plates (I literally do not understand why) and just sets his food down on the table, filling the rug and the table with crumbs. If I nag him about it, he goes up and rips off a sheet of paper towel to put it on instead. \n\nI don’t understand because he’s fine with doing a lot of other things that I consider objectively harder, like cleaning out the litter boxes or putting on all the sheets or folding laundry, but it’s all these little things he refuses to do that make me want to just live by myself. I have ADHD and it’s so important for me to stay on a routine and keep my shit together, and it’s just so frustrating to walk inside after work and see his dirty socks on the floor, his jacket strewn over the chair, the dry dishes still sitting out, the stove once again dirty, etc. \n\nI literally make it as easy as possible. We have a trash can and a laundry basket in basically every room of the apartment. I’m not even the cleanest person myself but at the bare minimum I just don’t want clutter everywhere. \n\nHow hard is it to put a pair of socks in a laundry basket? How hard is it to dry a few dishes after you were completely fine with spending an hour cooking and washing? Why does everything have to be done halfway, and only after I nag?\n\nIt’s genuinely been years. He just doesn’t care enough to stop or change his habits. I’m pretty much done with the relationship even though everything else about it is pretty great \n\nEdit: Just want to clarify stuff. When my boyfriend uses the kitchen, 99% of the time he’s using ingredients I pay for to make new concoctions and inventions for fun. It’s not like making a joint meal for dinner. If he wants to make cinnamon rolls at 9 pm after I’ve already cleaned the kitchen, then he can go for it, but I expect the kitchen to look the same way it did when I cleaned it. I have zero issue helping him clean up a meal we both ate. \n\nMy apartment has also had a chronic bug and roach infestation so it’s even more important to not leave food and crumbs out. He doesn’t care. The washer and dryers are shared by many people, so when he leaves a pen in his pockets and it explodes in the dryer, it makes a mess for 25+ people to deal with. He doesn’t care. It’s just all these inconsiderate things that he doesn’t think about. Yes, he does help out with things like the litter and trash and clothes, but not until I ask him to. So if I didn’t ask, nothing would happen. \n\nI understand these things might not be dealbreakers to others which is totally fine, but to me if you can’t care enough to spend 10 seconds picking your dirty socks off the ground when you know how much it bothers me, eventually I’m just going to take that as a sign of you not caring about me or my comfort \n\nYes we’ve had plenty of real conversations about it, he gets better for a few weeks and then things go back to being the same as before ', 'whoisthismahn', 'TwoXChromosomes', 'https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ooful8/ending_a_7_year_relationship_over_socks_and_crumbs/', 2399, 393, '2025-11-04 18:55:58', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),
(454, 'reddit', '1o3vs13', 'Crash course for people who don’t know what’s going on with Taylor Swift and why people are hating on the album', 'EDIT: I’m quite entertained by the multiple people accusing my post of being AI-generated lol. Nah I’m just an English teacher who loves to analyze and write for fun. \n\nI like Taylor Swift; I wouldn’t call myself a diehard fan or “Swiftie”, but I’ve enjoyed some of her music. To me, this album fell flat in multiple ways. Here’s a summary of why this album is not being well-received, even among her fans:\n\n**First of all, what made Taylor so beloved among girls and young women in the first place is she always felt relatable.** Yes she’s famous, but she has always sung about emotions and struggles that are so innate to girlhood, and maintained a “down-to-earth” persona that made people feel a very close emotional tie to her lyrics. Now this album has lyrics such as **“I like [my friends] cloaked in Gucci”** that instantly feel very off-putting and shatters the image that people loved about her in the first place. A harsh reminder that she is, in fact, a rich billionaire at the end of the day who might not be relatable to us at all. \n\n**Second of all, many people are saying her lyrics just aren’t as poetic or artistic in this album compared to her previous work.** Following her pop explosion in the 2010s, she matured into a more elevated songwriter and established herself as an extremely poetic songwriter (especially in Folklore and Evermore – her 2020-2021 albums that were less pop and more poetry). Her lyrics in this era were unique and had multiple layers of interpretation, encouraging fans to analyze and discuss the songs as literature, and she gained a lot of fans during this time. This set a standard that perhaps is impossibly high when someone wants to go back to just writing fun pop songs. I don’t necessarily share the opinion that ALL of the writing on this album is trash, but I do think a lot of it is lazy compared to her previous work, especially for someone who referred to herself as an “English Teacher” in her own engagement announcement post. Why in the world is Taylor Swift, one of our generation’s most talented lyricists, **writing an entire song (“Wood”) full of jokes about male anatomy?** Why is she using phrases like **“trolling and memes” or “girlbossed too close to the sun” or “my dick’s bigger” or “I’m not a bad bitch and this isn’t savage” that are so clearly meme/TikTok-esque and almost impossible to take seriously in what’s supposed to be a slow, emotional song?** These lyrics just won’t age well, as opposed to the timeless songs she was capable of writing in the past. **It feels like someone who’s fighting to stay relevant by using cheap slang and it backfires HARD.**\n\nEDIT: Okay fine, retracting the statement about “one of our generation’s most talented lyricists” because that’s a biased stretch. But I do think she puts more care into her lyrics than most other “Hot 100” mainstream artists. \n\n**Additionally, a lot of people think some songs come across as a “mean girl” vibe.** Sure Taylor has made a name for herself by writing songs about exes, but I always defended that because she wasn’t necessarily attacking them as people, but rather expressing her own emotion and heartbreak about the situation which she’s 100% allowed to do. This time feels more insidious than other times though. Last year, a smaller artist (Charli XCX) called Taylor a “Boring Barbie”, and sure that was rude, but now Taylor has gone and written an entire, and very sarcastic, diss track making fun of her (“Actually Romantic”). For the biggest star in the world to do that to a smaller fellow artist feels…honestly just mean. She could have easily ignored that trivial remark. It’s not being well received even among her fans who were annoyed at the original comment in the first place. Another example is in the song “Cancelled!” where she **brags that she “likes her friends cancelled”**, almost bragging that she likes being involved in scandal and controversy, which raises the question of who exactly she’s hanging around with and why.\n\n**Another controversy is in the song “Wish List”, and this one is more politically based.** Context: Last year, JD Vance made headlines for calling Kamala Harris a “childless cat lady” and claiming that women without children don’t have stake in the future of this country. Taylor Swift then soon after endorsed Kamala Harris, signing her Instagram post as “Childless Cat Lady”, a direct attack on Vance. Then Donald Trump retaliated by infamously tweeting “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”. Charlie Kirk also made comments about Taylor and Travis’ engagement, stating that he hoped Taylor would “submit to her husband” and that they would have many children together, as that would put Taylor in her place as a woman. Now fast forward to this album. In the song “Wish List”, Taylor contrasts herself (who is dreaming of having children with Travis Kelce) with people who have “three dogs that they call their kids”. Of course there’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to have children and expressing that in songwriting, but the specific juxtaposition of those two lines, given the events of last year, felt VERY intentional. **Why couldn’t she just sing about her own desires without making a dig and contrasting that with people who have “dogs that they call their kids”?** So basically last year she retaliated against the “Childless Cat Lady” comments, but now suddenly she got engaged and was like “okay bye losers!” and basically called her single fans all “Childless Cat Ladies” now too??? It’s sending the message that she’s just catering to whoever is benefiting her at the moment. \n\nThere are other criticisms online of potentially racist lyrics in this album (“onyx night”, “have the whole block looking like you”, “they want a fat ass”, “this isn’t savage”) but I personally think those are stretches. This “dogs that they call their kids” controversy though I think is not a stretch. That juxtaposition was not necessary, and after the very publicized events of last year, it’s not a mistake. Taylor is a very smart businesswoman and there’s no way she didn’t think this through – not after the PRESIDENT of the United States made a statement saying he hates her and she received so much negative press from his side. \n\n**Furthermore, the album just did not deliver the theme that Taylor promised.** She promised her fans a concept album that shows “behind the scenes” of a performer (a “showgirl”) like a “peek behind the curtain” of her Eras Tour. This excited fans into expecting a thoughtful album critiquing the nature of fame, and perhaps the exhaustion of always being “on a stage”. Swift has explored these themes in her lyrics before in multiple well-received previous songs (“Clara Bow”, “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”, etc.), and that’s what people were expecting more of. Preorders for the album boomed before anyone even heard it. However, the theme was overpromised and underdelivered because basically none of the album addresses that. Instead we got a song about her fiancé’s…….well anyway. \n\n**Lastly, the perceived capitalist greed that’s taken over Taylor is turning a lot of people off.** Taylor has a marketing tactic where she releases her album multiple times, flaunting different “versions”. Some artists release a “deluxe” album and that’s fine – **but she has released THIRTEEN different versions of the album on opening week ALONE!** *Some reports even say there are 34 versions, but they’re counting each format as a new version (ex. vinyl, CD, and cassette counting as three different versions, or two different vinyl colors counting separately as two). Various formats are normal of course, but my “13” count came from counting 13 literally sonically different VERSIONS of the same album.* The album is identical with only very minute differences – a different album cover, an acoustic/different version of a couple songs, and sometimes one new bonus song that is not available on Spotify/Apple Music/etc., so you HAVE to buy each version\'s physical copy to hear each bonus song. Diehard fans and collectors will buy all the versions, of course. But it gets to a point that it feels greedy, like she is taking advantage of her fans’ loyalty. And all of the versions will count collectively towards the album\'s chart performance, which also just doesn’t seem fair in competition with other artists who release their album only one or two times (and have it fully accessible on streaming services). She received a lot of negative press for doing this with her 2024 album as well, and it’s happening again. \n\nOverall, whether it’s because of the lyrics, the personality, the politics, the theme, or the greed, fans are very disappointed in this album. But, at the same time…by discussing it, we’re helping the publicity! All press is good press, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'tripper74', 'LetsTalkMusic', 'https://reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1o3vs13/crash_course_for_people_who_dont_know_whats_going/', 1720, 792, '2025-10-11 13:33:48', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

I wanted to create a ritual that feels intentional - more like putting a specific record on a turntable than swimming through an infinite stream of musical content. As a millennial I never really had a record collection, but I did have cassettes, and they remind me of a time where listening to music was THE activity I was doing, not a background layer of stimulation on top of 3 other ongoing tasks. \n\nNFC Cassette tapes are already a thing you can buy, but I wanted to redesign them in a way where they look and feel realistic. Mine are made up of several 3d printed parts, laser cut acrylic, and custom labels that were cut out on a vinyl cutter. Two separate halves are screwed together to avoid requiring any support material during the print, and honestly the screws add a level of realism that I really enjoy. You can also spin the white rollers with a pencil if you like (or your pinky finger like I used to do).\n\nThe actual \"player\" was the most fun to develop. A phone is the perfect candidate for a modern NFC cassette player, because it already has a speaker, an NFC reader, a screen to visualize playback and take (purposefully minimal) user input, volume controls, internet connection, and apps like spotify to deal with the music playback. I modeled the case in Rhino 3d based on some designs I had sketched, and used downloaded 3d models of my phone and cassette tapes to establish the scale of the overall form. \n\nThe parts were printed on a Bambu Labs P1S, and the app was developed first in Processing (using Android mode) and then was ported over to android studio (with a great deal of help from ChatGPT to get all the spotify integration working).\n\nThere are challenges making this work with iOS including the position of the NFC reader on iPhones, as well as the limitation of the operating system to prevent NFC tags from opening apps without the user approving first, but if there is enough interest I might look into creating designs that accomodate a wider range of phones.\n\nThanks for watching, I hope you like the project.

(456, 'reddit', '1oda3f6', 'My mom found an old stock certificate for 170 shares of NVDA', 'I was talking to my mom yesterday, who\'s in her early eighties, to offer to initiate a stock charitable donation from her brokerage account for the end of the year. That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven\'t seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they\'d buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia\'s secondary brand color. So it\'s pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I\'m wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I\'m wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia\'s splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today\'s shares and she\'s just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she\'s missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there\'s a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn\'t have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone\'s curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no one sells at precisely the right times. And for NVDA, the right time is still in the future, I believe.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nOk, I visited my mom yesterday and saw her stock certificate. Turns out it was just a PHOTOCOPY of the actual certificate. No!!! See photo 1. They have a safe deposit box so they probably made the copy for reference, while keeping the real certificate safe. The stock certificate could still be in the deposit box, though.\n\nI also learned the answer to the question I came here to ask - what happens with splits if you have paper certificates. I found the letter that Nvidia sent her on the 2:1 2006 split, and another for the 3:2 2007 split. See photo 2. What Nvidia did was inform them that their 170 newly issued shares were held on the books for them with the company, and could be accessed through Mellon Investor Services, while the first 170 shares were still held by the paper certificate. The paper certificate continued to represent 170 post-split shares, not 340. But this gave me a second avenue to check, with Mellon.\n\nI went to the safe deposit box yesterday afternoon and dug through it. I found some cool stuff, including some water shares but no NVDA shares. Dang it!\n\nSo my last avenue was to call Mellon Investor Services at the number in the letter. I did that just now. Turns out the number now goes to Computer Shares, but is still Nvidia\'s investor services. At first they found no account with my mom\'s SSN, but then they looked it up by my dad\'s name and address and found their account. And ... drum roll, please ... All the shares were transferred to a brokerage in May 2017. Dang it!\n\nSo these were the shares that she had sold that we have a memory of. And she must\'ve taken the share certificate from the safe deposit box at that time as well, and sold it all.\n\nMy math may be wrong, but as best I can tell they bought the 170 shares for $4386 on June 5, 2003, and sold them in May 2017 for $67,000. That\'s a 21.6% annualized gain, which is quite good, but a rather anticlimactic end to the story, compared to the $3.6 million that it might have been. To you who were rooting for her, as I was, sorry to disappoint.

The advice about all that magic in this subreddit is amazing and it can help you become a laundry god/goddess who always has squeaky clean clothes that last forever.\n\nBut there is also some bad advice here, and the worst bit shows up on nearly every thread- that you should add vinegar to your wash cycle. No-no-no you shouldn\'t. It\'s such terrible advice that there\'s even a bot dedicated to correcting it every time enters the discussion.\n\nLipase and TAED and all those other molecules are fabulous tools, but the fundamental workhorse of laundry science is soap- or surfactant if you want to be fancy. Soap is a magic molecule that can pull oil/fat/grime right off fabric and then keep it trapped in the water and away from your clothes. Then when the wash cycle ends, the soap makes sure that all that nastiness gets drained away with the water. \n\nAt least that\'s how it\'s supposed to work.\n\nSoap molecules are at their best when the water around them has a pH above 7 (alkaline). Your household water has a pH of 7 or close to it. That\'s ok, but not ideal. The good news is that along with soap laundry detergents include chemicals which increase the pH of the water in your washing machine. That\'s a good thing. You want that. \n\nVinegar is also known as acetic acid. Acids are chemicals with pHs below 7. The pH of regular distilled white vinegar is around 2.5. If you add vinegar to regular water, the pH goes down. \n\nSo... this is what happens on laundry day:\n\n\\-You start your washing machine and water begins filling the tub. That water has a pH of 7.\n\n\\-You add laundry detergent which includes the soap molecules that will clean your clothes as well as other chemicals that raise the pH (make it higher than 7). That\'s good. Your soap is in the perfect situation to clean your clothes.\n\n\\-And then you pour in  some vinegar. That vinegar lowers the pH back to 7 and then keeps lowering it. You\'ve not only robbed your soap of its extra help, but you\'ve made sure that it won\'t do its job as well as it would in plain water. Why? Why did  you do that?\n\n  \nIf the whole pH thing doesn\'t make sense, forget about the acid and alkaline stuff. Instead imagine that soap works best in hot water (it actually does), but you are only able to add room temperature water to you washing machine. Thankfully your laundry detergent has other things in it that can double the temperature of water. That\'s fabulous. Things are all set for your soap to do the best possible job.\n\nBut then before you close the lid on your machine, you dump in a 10lb bag of ice. Now the water is cold. You\'ve just gone from perfect conditions to worst case and your soap is going to do a terrible job.\n\n  \nBut wait, you say. I\'ve used vinegar for years. So did my mom. So did her mom. I swear by it. It\'s the answer to my every prayer and I\'m not giving it up.\n\nReally? Are you 100% sure?\n\nIf so, I challenge you to try an experiment: The next time you have a load of laundry to do, divide it in half. Run one half through on a cycle using only laundry detergent- and don\'t dump in the massive amount you usually use. Instead, add only the amount recommended on the box. Then run the other half through along with as much vinegar as you want. \n\nAfter both loads are dry, spread everything out and compare. Are both loads equally clean? Are you shocked that the load with just the detergent looks so good? Did it seem like you added far too little detergent? You were expecting that load to come out still dirty, weren\'t you?\n\nSurprise!\n\n  \n(The twist at the end is because you\'ve been using way too much detergent all this time. You had to add tons extra because your vinegar was ruining most of it. Stop adding the vinegar and you shouldn\'t need more than about a tablespoon per load.

Near every brand you can think of related to PC building is present, rows on rows of peripherals, cases, internals and more. Well stocked GPUs, mainly AMD and Nvidia with a small Intel section.

Switches, APs, server racks and more all present.\n\nThe staff and sales associates were EXTREMELY knowledgeable in their areas and fetched those who were if they didn\'t know the answer to your question.  Best Buy has nothing on them in this area. My one nitpick gripe is if you\'re just browsing, expect to be approached very often. I give them slack and understanding in this because it\'s near their opening, many were extremely passionate and excited, and there were clearly some corporate honchos present as well. Nonetheless still a pleasant experience in that regard. They do price matching, and allow you to fully put together your build and you can send associates a list of your build and they\'ll help you find it.  If you want them to build it you can have them do so for a small fee.\n\n\nOverall I\'m extremely happy we finally have a physical electronics store with staff that actually know what they\'re selling.

Now it feels like she was only doing that because she had to. She always was the person who had my back. I just feel like she is a lie.*\n\n---\n\n**Are you a rebellious teen or going through phase?**\n\n*I am not rebellious or going through a phase. I am actually really respectful of authority, have a job, 3.9 GPA, extra curriculars and I don\'t smoke or drink.*\n\n---\n\n**Where does your dad live?**\n\n*I don\'t know. He sends a check to his lawyer and I have not seen, heard from, spoken to, or had anything to do with him. We are not aware of his current location.*\n\n---\n\n**Have you lived with auntie before?**\n\n*I stayed with my aunt for three months when my mom injured her back... a year ago. She is fine now (my mom) and there is little to no pain. I liked living with my aunt. She had me do chores and help around with her animals/plants. She also said I can bring my dog and cat with me.*\n\n*But I just... I feel like my world is turning upside down. I am 16, I don\'t do anything. I work and pay for myself. I drove around and paid for my own gas. I just don\'t understand why my mom looks at me like I am some horrid burden. She can go to school, I don\'t care. I just thought I mattered.*\n\n**How\'s your auntie?**\n\n*I do love my aunt. She is a nice woman and it seems unfair my mom, who apparently didn\'t ever want me (great thing to hear) had kids and she could not. She works with kids, has a lot of spare income, so it could work out for the best. She has told me she would love to take me with her to England over Christmas break. Cause there is no way in hell I am going to see my mother in the next two years.*\n\n*If she didn\'t want me, then she doesn\'t get to have me around when I am an adult. I feel hurt and betrayed. I just don\'t want to be the girl that her mom rejected.*\n\n---\n\n**Have you talked to your aunt? Is your current job part of a chain? ask if your employer will write you a letter of recommendation**\n\n*I work at Subway. So maybe I can call up a few of the other one\'s and see. I have a great record for being on time and staying late (if I can, I am in high school so there is a limit on my hours.) I am sure Mr. B will be willing to do that for me. I am his Sammich Daughter. I will miss him.*\n\n*Auntie has been in touch with me. She said my mom is being stupid but she would love to have me. She says she wants to take me clothes shopping, get me new bedding, and repaint the room before I get there.

I forgot I had even posted on here with everything going on.\n\nI ended up going to my auntie\'s. She came and packed up my whole room with me and drove me to her house. It was really hard, because my mom was already talking about selling the house and moving to some other city, so she could start her life.\n\nI still have a lot of pain from what she did, but living with my Aunt and Uncle has been a great experience. Mr. B (my boss) got me a job at a Subway where my Aunt lives. I really like the people I work with.\n\nI started dating someone at my new school and we have been together for 5 months. Dan (17m) is great and we are in the same grade (he just turned 17), so we had the whole year together. School is ending in a few weeks and we have plans to go to the beach with my Aunt and Uncle for a week.\n\nI met some new friends and got involved with Volleyball and took part in drama. I also am Assistant Treasurer, because I was able to talk to the teacher in charge of the group and said I wanted experience. When she saw my transcripts, she said I could assist the girl who got the position. The girl (Joleen) is actually really cool and we became pretty good friends.\n\nI still keep in touch with my friends from home, but I really feel like I have a great support system now. I haven\'t told anyone why I moved here just yet, minus my boyfriend, because its too embarrassing. And I don\'t like to talk about it.\n\nI was doing really good and had decided I didn\'t really want to see my mom again. Because who abandons their own kid?\n\nMy mom came up last week and she has been waiting around to see me. I didn\'t know why until Saturday because my aunt finally told me, because my mom barged into the house and refused to leave. Auntie asked if I wanted to talk to \"her\" and I told her I would.\n\nMy mom said she was so sorry for the way she treated me, that she wanted to know if I would move back for my senior year. She said we could pack up anytime I wanted.\n\nShe then asked my aunt if she could stay in the guest room.\n\nMy aunt said the room was mine.\n\nMy mom said \"Lucy doesn\'t mind sharing.\"\n\nMy mom tried really hard to get me to chat with her alone, but Auntie stayed with me. It came out that my Mom wanted me to come home because her boyfriend left her and she blew through her money.\n\nAuntie told Mom she needed to leave and then told me that my mom had been calling her about the check my birth father sends her. I guess she contacted the lawyer, said I was in her custody, and my mom signed the papers my aunt asked her to. Mom didn\'t realize it meant the check was coming to Auntie, who said she put most of it into a savings account for me.\n\nThere were some things she needed money for and I am grateful she is paying for me and keeping me. It could have been so much worse.\n\nI guess the checks were pretty big.\n\nSo I just told my mom not to contact me again. It hurt, a lot. The only reason she wanted me around was because of a check.\n\nThat said, I guess my aunt has my father\'s number. She said he wants to talk with me when I am ready. So there is that.\n\nI am not sure what to do now?

(462, 'reddit', '1oip88w', 'Had to say goodbye to my deeply beloved 20-year old cat Jackie today…', 'Well, here I am making one of these threads.  Feeling pretty raw about things.  \n\nI don’t even really have words, right now.  Which is funny because I used to make literally hundreds of posts about her on a pet subforum in another corner of the internet, a lifetime ago.  She was the most gentle, loving, amazing cat - but she was also tough and not afraid to let you know what she was thinking!  \n\nThis is a cat who saved my life more times than I can count or think of just by simply being there for me when nobody else was, and helped me through so many hard times and transitions.  I drove across the country with Jackie twice, and she was the best traveling companion I’ve ever had or could hope for.  \n\nAnyway, things had been getting increasingly tougher and tougher for her this past year.  She had a seizure for the first time back in August, which scared the hell out of me - thankfully it was the only one she ever had.  Her mobility had been getting worse and worse lately, and the last few months she had lost the ability to run or jump or climb, when the year before she was still running up and down the stairs at top speed.  But lately she’s had to walk very slowly, and I’ve had to carry her up onto my bed for when she wanted to cuddle with me, and then I’d have to bring her off the bed when she wanted a drink or to use the litter box.  We had a whole system we had worked out, and it was quite functional!  \n\nThings had gotten even worse this past week.  She was rapidly losing weight again, and just walking across the room or climbing over the rim of the litter box was starting to be a really difficult and exhausting task for her, especially on the parts of our tiled floor without carpeting, where she could barely support herself anymore without her legs slipping under her.  Her right eye had also started weeping constantly and filling up with gunk, but it seemed to be getting better for a while.  And she was still eating with an appetite, and still making it to the litter box on her own when she needed to, and still cuddling next to me and purring in the evening, and still scratching on the bathroom door for me to let her in if I had the nerve to close it - she did that yesterday.  So it hadn’t really seemed time yet, even though things were looking grim she had pulled herself out of this sort of thing before in this past year.  \n\nThen she had an especially bad day yesterday in terms of her mobility, where it just hurt to watch her so much as stand, and I could tell that just the act of sitting down and getting up again had become a really difficult and painful task, for her.  Then this morning, she suddenly had this massive lump on her spine that I know had not been there a few days ago and I’m pretty sure wasn’t even that visible yesterday.  She had eaten a little last night but wasn’t touching her food this morning, either.   So it just…. Felt like it was the time to make this decision before things got any worse, and I didn’t want her to go through any more pain than she already had, and…. Yeah.\n\nI brought her into the local vet right down the street - they were very kind and let me bring her in right away without any appointment, they had seen her a couple times earlier this summer.  I sat with her in a back exam room for a little while and told her what an amazing cat she was and how much I loved her over and over and cried a lot, then the doctor came in and gave her a sedative while she was still on my lap - she didn’t struggle at all.  I could feel her relax and go limp in my arms, but could still feel her heart beating and her chest barely rising and falling - honestly, I think the sedative alone would have been enough to take her out. She was barely hanging on.\n\nWe maintained eye contact the entire time through this.  She closed her eyes for a little while after the sedative while she was on my lap, but she was having some difficulty breathing so I had to lay her flat on the table.  And her good eye was still open and looking right at me the entire time, I’m not sure if she was at all conscious but it seemed like it.  She didn’t struggle or resist and there was nothing traumatic or difficult - he gave her the injection and she was gone 2 seconds later. Her eye was still open and still fixed right on me, even after she passed.  Which is kind of haunting but also a little beautiful, and I know she adored me and I’m really glad I could be there right to the end for her, and that her end was peaceful.\n\nSo that’s about all I can do for now.  Great cats are hard to come by, and she was a truly great cat.  I’m so glad I had such a long and happy time with her.  I might make another post at some later time, I just felt like I needed to put something together.\n\n(About the pictures - the first two are from last summer, the third one is from way back in December of 2005 when she was still a teeny kitten with my dad’s dog Freda whom she loved, the fourth one is from three months ago, the fifth one is from three weeks ago, and the last one is from this morning).

(463, 'reddit', '1o7nq25', 'I just saved a cat from my walls: what do I do?', 'This is a very long and bizarre situation and I\'d like to ask for advice since I\'m very new to cats, I\'ll leave a tldr at the bottom just in case.\n\nTwo days ago I heard what sounded like meowing coming from the walls of my bathroom. I wasn\'t sure if it was a cat or just my ventilation ducts being bad (my apartment kind of sucks and I\'ve had problems everywhere), so I put in a maintenance request. Yesterday, I received a call from my apartment maintenance staff saying they cut holes in the drywall of my dining area and found a kitten in my walls and that it wasn\'t cooperating with them in coming out, so they put some wet food in a cage and just hoped the kitten would smell the food and eventually come out. The kitten was running around in the back of the wall behind two pipes, and after some inspection I realized that the kitten might be too short to climb over the pipes and too scared (or its head was too large) to climb through the pipes. Additionally, one maintenance guy said the kitten had fallen into (or walked in? Idrk) my insulation through a vent, and that there were 2 or 3 other kittens by that ventilation opening. I have no clue what that means or where that vent is, but that means this kitten is potentially part of a larger litter of kittens belonging to another cat somewhere in my apartment complex.\n\nAfter talking with my maintenance people some more I got the impression that they weren\'t going to actively try to help the kitten get out, and I happen to have a soul and don\'t want a kitten to just die, so my friends and I took matters into our own hands. I took the wet food from the cage and placed it into the drywall so the kitten didn\'t starve (cuz it had been almost 2 days without food at this point), and my friends came over and were able to fish the kitten out. After about two hours of luring him around with wet cat food we finally got him out of my walls and got him to a vet.\n\nThe next part I wasn\'t present for (I work pretty insane hours so I had to go to bed), but the vet apparently said there was no microchip and the cat was very healthy and well fed. Apparently he\'s around 4 weeks old (no guarantees though). The vets conclusion was that the mother was somewhere nearby in my apartment complex, but since the kitten wasn\'t microchipped they said it\'s likely that the kitten and its mother are both strays. If what that other maintenance guy said earlier is true then theres a whole litter of strays, with at least 2 or 3 other kittens somewhere in my apartment complex. \n\nCurrently two of my friends who helped rescue the kitten are taking care of him, they\'re roommates and happen to own two other cats (one of whom they raised as a kitten) so he\'s in good hands for now, but they don\'t have the means to fully own him and continue raising him. We\'re planning on taking him to get dewormed and vaccinated next week. I\'ve been looking into getting a cat for a while now and I\'ve reached a point of financial stability in my life so I think I can handle it. I originally intended to adopt from the Atlanta Humane Society, but after living with this kitten for almost 2 days in my walls I want to find a home for him. \n\nHowever, I recognized that this is a kitten and not a fully grown cat, and that comes with a different set of challenges. \n\nHopefully yall enjoyed the cat saving story! Now my friends and I need advice.\n\nFirst: I\'d like to take care of this kitten myself! I want to own a cat, and I have plenty of space in my apartment for one since I live alone in a 1b1b. However since it\'s a kitten I\'m aware that comes with certain other challenges: I\'ve read a bit from kittenlady.org, and my friends are currently weaning the kitten onto wet food. Additionally, I work from 7 am to 4 pm roughly on a 9-40 schedule (every other week I get friday off), so my apartment will be vacant while I am at work. I also don\'t know how often he needs to be fed, and I\'m not sure if he\'ll be fully weaned off by the time I\'d have to take him in. That being said, I\'m willing to dedicate my entire afternoons and evenings (about 5 hours a day) as well as my weekends and off days to taking care of the kitten and socializing it for as long as that takes. Is that enough time for me to take care of a kitten and feed him? I\'m aware of the paw trick while he\'s sleeping to get him used to me handling his paws, but what other important milestones or tricks do I need to be aware of if I were to raise this kitten?\n\nSecond: I think I\'ve found a comprehensive list of things that I need to buy to take care of cats. On my list I have a litter box, non-clumping litter, wet food (and eventually dry kibble), cat toys, a scratching post, pee pads, and a cat enclosure since I don\'t have a small restricted space for the kitten. I\'m also going to buy an automatic feeder down the line, but I\'m not sure if thats a good idea for now since he\'s still a kitten. Is there anything else I need to purchase to take care of a kitten?\n\nThird: I will be checking around my apartment later today to see if I can find the momma strays and the other kittens in the litter. I know the momma stray exists since I\'ve seen her roaming around my apartment, and I\'m planning to buy some wet food to lure her out. After that though I have no plan and no idea what I should do next. Any advice? I live in the Atlanta metro area in Georgia, so do I take them all to the humane society? If I can\'t find the vent or the rest of the litter, what else can I do?\n\nTLDR: I just saved a 4 week old kitten from my walls and I want to take care of him, but it would be my first cat and I need advice. Thank you all in advance for your help!\n\nI\'ve also posted this in r/cats, but since it is a kitten after all I figured I should post here as well!', 'a_coney_dragon', 'kittens', 'https://reddit.com/r/kittens/comments/1o7nq25/i_just_saved_a_cat_from_my_walls_what_do_i_do/', 4058, 188, '2025-10-15 21:25:38', '2025-11-08 01:36:52'),

I have 3 young kids (this is important later) At first my neighbour was very nice and popped in once in a while to see how we are settling in. This was fine.\n\nNow her and her daughter (23) are calling in 2/3 times a day asking to borrow something or for me to do them a favor.\nIt is never anything huge, but it is really annoying.\n\nI have tried not answering the door, but they walk around the house peering into windows until they get the afore mentioned children\'s attention and they will ask the kids to answer the door.\nI have told them that I am very busy and don\'t have time, nothing changed.\n\nI have tried to be nice but firm, but I am really quiet and non-confrontational, as and I am this house for at least the next two years I don\'t want to fight with them.\n\nThe last straw was today when the mother asked me to mind their dog for today, tonight and all day tomorrow so she could go out to a party. I said no. (I have 2 cats, they dislike dogs greatly) she came back twice more. I stuck by my guns and refused. She tied the dog on my gate and went to her party.\n\nWhat the hell Reddit? Help!! How do I (nicely) make her go away.\n\ntldr: Neighbour is completely overbearing, I am not good at confrontation, how do I nicely make her go away?\n\nEdit: a word\n\nEdit 2: Thank you all for answering, I really didn\'t expect so many responces. You guys are great! I kept the dog inside last night because it wasn\'t her fault and I felt guilty leaving it out. The dog didn\'t settle.... at all. I finally got asleep at half 5 this morning so I am just exhausted, I have had enough and am going to have it out with her today, I have decided to tell her that her damn dog kept me up all night, and the next time that she pulls that stunt she won\'t see the dog again. (I will call the ISPCA, she doesn\'t need to know that) I am also going to tell her that I have had enough of her and she isn\'t welcome anymore, if she knocks on my door again I am calling the police. I will update on the reaction and whether it works or not. On a side note I am bloody terrified!! Thanks again to everyone.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**springplum**\n\n&gt;You will not be able to nicely make her go away. If nice was a word in her lexicon she wouldn\'t do shit like you posted. Take photos of her peering in your windows. Next time she walks around your property-off sidewalk-call the police for trespassing. She\'s exhibiting stalker like behaviors.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I am going to tell her not to call in anymore as I am very busy and she is too much with her requests, but in smaller words...she is not a smart man. Thank you, I need to grow a pair\n\n**~**\n\n**[deleted]**\n\n&gt;Not sure about how to make her go away but in terms of being left with dog you should take it to a kennel or a dog sitter and leave her with the bill. It is not OK to leave a pet with someone else when they explicitly said no three times, especially when they have legit reason, as you do.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I just text her and said that I was putting the dog outside for the night. She said \"No, she can sleep in your bed.\"\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; WHAT?\n\n**idhavetocharge**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you text her back and tell her no. You dont want a dog in your bed or in your house. If she wants it to sleep in a bed she should not have went anywhere and left it with someone who said they couldnt take care of it. The dog will be outside when she gets back.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You can let the dog stay inside if it is behaved and you feel bad for it, but get up early and tie is outside so she thinks it stayed out all night.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you dont want to be rude but stop being her doormat. Tell the kids they are not allowed to open the door for anyone and there will be punishment if they do.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If she asks to borrow things make a notebook and have her sign for what she borrows. More than one unreturned item means \'sorry, you still have not returned this thing and i need it, i cant let you have anything else until i get this back\'.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; She wants to borrow a few eggs? Ask for a cup of sugar.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Put up curtains she cant see through. Or write notes and tape them in the windows. \' please dont peek through my windows\' \' i didnt answer the door because i am busy, try back in an hour\'.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If she wont stop calling, answer the phone and give it to the youngest most unable to speak child and tell them to talk about whatever they are excited about. My nephew can rattle on about hotwheel cars all day.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; She asks you for help? \'Sure i can get to that in about two weeks\' .\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; She just comes over to chat and be nosy? Rope her into whatever task you are working on. \'Sure i can talk but i need to get these clothes folded. Would you mind doing those towels for me while we talk? \' or hand her a towel and a wet dish to dry.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt; I text her back and said she is outside, if you are not home by 10am I will be living her outside your house as I have plans and will not be home.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have the kids warned not to open the door.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried the cleaning plan before, I saw her walk up the driveway so I started vaccuming, she knocked, I ignored it, she walked around the house and got in the back door, I forgot to lock it, and she stood in the kitchen for forty minutes as I hoovered the (already clean) house. When I finished, she was still there and it was time for me to collect the kids from school, I got my keys and she asked for a ride to the shop. I said no (it\'s in the opposite direction of the school) and she got angry. I should point out it\'s a ten minute walk to the shop. I left her fuming on my doorstep..... where I found her when I came back 30 minutes later. This is the level of crazy we are dealing with.\n\n**quien**\n\n&gt;&gt;That is creepy. Police time. Also, stop being so sweet you don\'t owe her anything. Use the suggestions previous posters have given.\n\n**When told to call animal control**\n\n&gt;I am in Ireland, they work from 10am to 1pm, it\'s almost 7pm here. Looks like I am stuck with this bloody thing for the night\n\n**Jenwah85**\n\n&gt;&gt;Remember that this isn\'t the dogs fault. Make sure it has water and shelter atleast.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The dog was taken care of last night she was inside all night, despite my threatening to leave her out.... see I told you I am a wuss!\n\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/r8lPZeJlD5)  **May 27, 2014 (2 days later)**\n\nThe original thread is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26dz2p/me_31f_with_my_terribly_overbearing_neighbour/) but basically long story short I have an awful neighbour who won\'t take no for an answer and ended up leaving her dog with me, despite being told I wouldn\'t take it.\n\nFirst of all, thank you everyone who answered, I hadn\'t expected such a response, you guys are brill! I can\'t thank you enough for your suggestions and advice.\n\nThe dog kept us awake all night, no matter what I tried it would not sleep, or even shut up. I finally got asleep at half 5 that morning. So when the neighbour (I\'m calling her Mary) rocked in yesterday afternoon to ask for some milk I was fit to kill.\n\nI had left the dog tied to her gate at 10am, and sent her a text saying the same. She didn\'t reply or mention it when she knocked at the door.\n\nI had locked the front door and warned the kids not to open it. When I opened it she tried to walk in by me. I didn\'t say anything but didn\'t let her in.\n\nMary said, \'How was the dog for you? Isn\'t she a pet?\'\n\nI told her that no the dog was not a pet, it had been a nightmare, that we had gotten no sleep. She replied that if I had just let the dog sleep in my bed under the covers it would have been fine. And \"the next time\" I should let her into my bed.\n\nI kinda saw red at that point, I don\'t let my kids sleep in my bed never mind a damn dog.I told her there would not be a next time and that if she ever left her dog tied to my gate again the dog would disappear.\n\nShe stood silently with her mouth open.\n\nI went on to tell her that I was not the type of person to ask for favors from people I didn\'t know, and I don\'t expect it to be done to me. And I finished by telling her that while I hoped we could continue to get on, she was not welcome in my house uninvited or to ask me to do something for her.\n\nShe stormed off.\n\nThat was yesterday, I haven\'t seen her since. But the day is young!\n\ntl;dr: Finally grew some balls and had it out with my neighbour. Haven\'t seen her since, but I suspect this isn\'t over.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n&gt; howlongwillbetoolong 166 1h29m\nWell done you!\n&gt;\n&gt; Just wondering, what did you tell your kids regarding why they shouldn\'t let her in? There\'s definitely a lesson to be learned in this experience.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I told them that we had a new house rule and only parents could answer the door, no matter who it was.\n\n**~**\n\n**SemiHollowCarrot**\n\n&gt;Just curious, what are some of the things they would call you about other than the dog?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Milk, sugar, my weighing scales, bread, a cigarette, a ride to the shops, a stamp, to use my washing machine. You name it she asked for it.\n\n**Not_Tilden_Katz**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Wow! Just wow. How far away from you are places to buy these things? I have never asked a neighbour (unless they are a really good friend) for one of these things.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A ten minute walk. :/ She doesn\'t drive but her legs are working just fine\n\n[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/eCxArD3uM9)  **June 13, 2014 (2 weeks later)**\n\nHi Guys, I haven\'t updated for a while \'cos things have been a bit crazy. [here is the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26dz2p/me_31f_with_my_terribly_overbearing_neighbour/)  and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26l5lu/update_me_31f_with_my_terribly_overbearing/) is the first update. \n\nAgain, I want to thank you all for your messages, support and advice. You guys are the best. \n\nAfter I had it out with her she backed off, big time... for a while. For around a week she didn\'t come near me. Which was awesome. \n\nBut, she isn\'t the sharpest tool in the box, so it didn\'t last long. Last week she was having a party and came in to invite us in. I said no thanks. I should point out that she hadn\'t spoken to me since I told her that I wouldn\'t be taking her dog again, so the invitation was completely out of the blue and honestly a bit weird. \n\nAnyway, the party was last Friday night. She must have tried to call in when I was collecting the kids from school, cos when I got home there was a note that said \'Party starting at 6. Bring kids. Mary.\'\n\nI didn\'t. \n\nThe party started, and went on, and on and on. At twelve o\'clock I went in and asked her to turn the music down, it was blaring into her back garden and my kid\'s bedrooms around the back of our house. She said \'Oh Hi Name_Game, come on in.\' \n\nI told her no, thank you, please just turn the music down, my kids can\'t sleep. \n\nShe didn\'t. And instead I suggested that I get the kids, and my husband and we all go to the party. At midnight. She thought it was a good idea to bring my kids into a house full of drunk strangers. Really? \n\nAnyway,  I went in twice more to ask her to turn down the music, then I gave up and called the police. When the cops arrived they turned it down for about 5 minutes. Long story short, this happened a few times, the music was finally turned off at half past four. \n\nI met her the next day as I was getting into my car, she said \'Oh I hope that music didn\'t bother you last night.\' \n\nI told her of course it had bothered me, I had called into her numerous times and resorted to calling the police. \n\nShe said \'Well I turned it off at one o\'clock.\'\n\nI said \'No, it was half past four.\' \n\nShe said \'Well, at least it was good music.\' \n\nREALLY? \n\nAnyway, I told her that if it happened again I would be speaking to her landlord. \n\nShe hasn\'t spoken to me since. \n\nIt seems to be going in cycles, she pushes her luck, gets given out to, sulks for a week or two and then does it again. We can\'t afford to move for another year or two so I am stuck with the crazy bitch for a while. I think that I just need to accept that I have a really horrible, selfish neighbour and this behaviour is just going to continue until I can afford to move. \n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: My neighbour remains a crazy, selfish bitch. On the plus side I should be able to afford to move in a couple of years :(\n\n\n**OOP has appeared in the thread and updated 11 years later**\n\n\n[New Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/Sxp5TOwni2)  **Nov 7, 2025 (11 years later)**\n\nHi all,  I\'m OOP. I love this sub and was a bit shocked to see my post in it.  I\'d long forgotten about it,  and really should have updated. I hope it\'s OK to do it here. \n\n\nI was going through a lot at that time, my kids were young, my husband was back in college, and we were trying to recover from the recession. I think Mary could see I was non confrontational and in a bad place and thought that I was an easy target.\n\n\n\nMy husband had lost his job and was in college,  but was going through a mental health crisis during this time so I was essentially dealing with it alone while trying to hold everything in my house together\n\n\n\nShe continued asking for things,  and trying to call in.  I locked the gate,  and door and stopped opening it if I wasn\'t expecting someone. She started messaging me on Facebook, I blocked her.  It went like that for a while. And she slowly stopped trying. Occasionally she\'d see me out with the kids and come over to try get me to do something or tell me some big drama she was having, presumably to make me feel sorry for her,  but I just gray rocked her. \n\nIn the meantime I met a few other neighbours, I tend to keep to myself,  who told me this was her tactic with anyone new and most of them didn\'t speak to her. \n\nThe cold shoulder eventually worked,  it was slow though.  But for about a year I had peace.  Then she moved out ( well done to the person in the comments who said they\'d never met an Irish person who acted like that,  she wasn\'t Irish), and went back to her home country. \n\n\n\nI am still in that house,  15 years later.  My husband is much better, my kids are all in college.  My new neighbour is lovely,  we say a few words to each other when we see each other,  and when it was her child\'s communication she dropped in cake and wine as there was going to be a party and she wanted to make sure I didn\'t mind the noise.  There was no noise i noticed.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP\'s OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**', 'Direct-Caterpillar77', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oqll6g/me_31f_with_my_terribly_overbearing_neighbour/', 3121, 196, '2025-11-07 05:02:01', '2025-11-08 01:36:52');

Some back story: my friend is currently in university and has an upcoming medical school interview, so she\'s been very stressed.\n\nSince she got engaged in the summer, she has had no idea what she wanted to do for colors. I and the other bridesmaid suggested she order some swatches from Azazie so she could start building a color palette. At Christmas time, she still hadn\'t determined her colors, but she wanted to go shopping for her flowers at a local silk florist. Originally she wanted to design her own bouquet, but before even going shopping for those flowers, she ordered $400 worth of flowers from Temu all of which she isn\'t using now.\n\nNow that she has her flowers picked out, she still can\'t come to a decision on colors for her bridesmaids dresses. She originally wanted to get dresses from Park &amp; Fifth so she went to the store and tried them on herself and loved them. Her sister who is her maid of honour hated all of the dresses because of the style (form fitting and silk).\n\nThis past weekend, I got a text from the bride to show me the colors she had chosen. There was a dusty lilac, agave, yellow, blue, and a peach. She asked which color I would feel comfortable wearing, I said any color she wanted me to wear, I\'d more than happily wear! She then said that wasn\'t a good enough answer and that she wanted my opinion. I said again, that any color would be good! So she picked purple for me and that was good enough by me. She has said to us bridesmaids multiple times that we can pick whatever dress we want as long as we\'re comfortable. But then she asked me to send her the top dresses I liked so she could pick. I agreed and sent her the ones I liked. She asked out of all of them, which was my favorite so I told her and then she said that it wasn\'t hers and she preferred a different one. I said to her that I wouldn\'t be as comfortable in that one if that\'s what she was concerned about, but I would wear it happily! She asked for some time to think about it and she would get back to me.\n\nAbout an hour later she was freaking out after thinking she found her bridesmaid dress colors and then realizing they didn\'t look good with her flowers. So she asked for advice and I said if she went with her gut and stuck to only agave, it would look beautiful with her other color navy. But then she said she should\'ve simplified her flowers if she wanted bright colors. It became a whole thing, and she can\'t change her flowers now because she already has them.\n\nI also explained to her that out of 1000 photos her photographer will take 10-15 will be with her bridesmaids and also her photographer has a very muted style so that\'ll also change the colors in a picture.\n\nThen all of a sudden she flips a switch while I\'m telling her that all of these ideas are all very pretty and will work. She then says \"I think agave is the way I want to go. I think it\'ll look great on everyone and I\'m not asking this time, I\'m just to be telling.\" At that point I was so confused because she wanted our opinions as to which colour we liked. Only 2 of the bridesmaids got to pick what they liked. I told her I would wear anything. Then she said that she doesn\'t want to come across as pushy and I told her she wasn\'t being pushy. Finally, I asked if she was looking for opinions or for us to tell her that we didn\'t like the color she wanted us to wear. It\'s her wedding. But she is so wrapped up in what other people will think that it\'s inhibiting her to make a decision. I said the only thing that\'s making her sound pushy is when she tells us we can wear whatever dress we want, but she wants to pick the dress. I explained that if she wants us to feel comfortable, that\'s not how you go about that.\n\nAt that point, her fiance texted the other bridesmaid to tell her to \"casually\" mention to me that I was being rude and that the bride was incredibly offended that I didn\'t like her favorite dress because I liked my favorite dress. But the bride never communicates when she\'s offended about something. It ended up being a whole thing, and I later apologized to her for coming across as aggressive. But I also said to her if she\'s seeking opinions and advice, she can\'t keep getting mad when someone gives her advice or opinions. Bear in mind, for my wedding, this girl is also my bridesmaid and told me the dresses I wanted for bridesmaids were ugly and she wouldn\'t do her hair how I wanted it done.\n\nShe later tells me she won\'t kick me out of the wedding and that my opinions and advice are incredibly valuable to her. But every time she asks for my opinion, she just gets mad at me. So I\'ve determined she\'s seeking validation and just wants everyone to agree with her all the time.\n\nThat\'s my bridezilla story. This is incredibly exhausting to me.\n\n**Some Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Whatever you were doing before, isn\'t working too well. If YOU are having this much stress now, then maybe you need to speak to the bride and see if you should just come as a guest. She\'ll probably freak out, but your mental health is your 1st priority, not a wedding.\n\n&gt; **OOP:**I fully agree with you. I had a very similar situation a little more than a year ago, and the bride and groom ended up kicking me out of the wedding party. I\'ve been told that I\'m very blunt and that comes from years of working with only men. So I see the world as black and white and yes or no. No ifs, ands, or buts. It just is what it is. My boyfriend has also helped me not care what others think anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would feel terrible telling her that I don\'t want to be a bridesmaid. But in some sense, I think she\'s also upset because my boyfriend and I just finished designing my engagement ring and in her world, she\'s the only one who can be engaged at a time. Her sister got engaged shortly after her and she texted me being all salty about it, and I told her that it\'s not the end of the world, there can be more than 1 bride in this world. She didn\'t like that, but I didn\'t know what else to say to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; In another way, we\'re often \"competing\" about things. But that\'s what girls do. But everything my boyfriend and I do, she wants to do with her fiance but he isn\'t interested. Her fiance has also made more comments than necessary about how pretty I am or that my boyfriend is incredibly lucky to have me. So he gives me weird vibes sometimes.\n\n**Commenter 2:** You need to learn to \"turn into the skid\" with people like this. You can validate her feelings : she was hoping to be the only bride and she\'s frustrated at her sister because her expectation doesn\'t match reality. That doesn\'t mean that she should act on these feelings, but she just wants to be \'seen.\' \"Yes bride, it must be frustrating having your families attention and energy split.\" This is a really great tactic to take with toddlers also, btw. Show her that you \'see\' her, but don\'t validate her acting on these feelings.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Another great point, thank you! Sometimes I feel like I need to react to her issues like she is a toddler. She\'s also 22, and I\'m almost 25 so our age differences and the fact that I\'m second youngest in my family and she\'s the oldest really shows how we deal with conflict.\n\n**Sounded like the bride was unsure of herself and kept changing the rules / goals for the wedding**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Oh for sure. I don\'t know fully how she was raised. But her parents I know didn\'t raise her to have so many issues making decisions. Even the week before her boyfriend proposed, she was talking about how she wasn\'t ready to get married and sometimes I think she needs to think about that again. She wasn\'t ready, but the diamond got flashed in front of her and it was her moment. She never told her boyfriend she wasn\'t ready, and he should\'ve known that because she\'s caused so many issues.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Uh. Girls - and good friends, regardless of sex - don\'t compete, they lift each other up and support each other.\n\nAnyway, if I were you, I\'d drop out. It\'s only going to get worse from here - my God, 500 words about flowers? I can\'t wait until she has to choose the food...\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I just feel like since the day we met, it was always competition. I went on birth control, she had to go on birth control but she was too lazy to remember to take her pill, she was fine taking Plan B and rubbing that in my face because my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to wait until marriage now.\n&gt; \n&gt; We bought a camper, now she wants a camper so bad so she can renovate it like we\'re doing to ours and she can tell me that it\'s not that much work. It\'s a lot of work when it\'s too cold to work on it outside and you work full time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes I think our friendship is more forced. My other friends that are true and genuine friends, I never feel like we\'re competing for things. When they get married, it\'s the best time ever, they have kids, and it\'s amazing!\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh for food, it was decided 2 days after they were engaged–hot dogs.\n\n**Commenter 4:** JFC. Why are you still entertaining this bullshit? I couldn\'t even finish the post because the bride is so annoying. Just don\'t go to the wedding. With people like her, friendships often end with the wedding. I had a pick-me bridesmaid (I didn\'t care about the dress, just keep it a lighter color, or anything else about their looks. She insisted on getting a skintight wedding dress for her bridesmaid dress) and I just uninvited her the day of. I told her I didn\'t need her drama anymore, as she has always behaved like this. Never spoke to her again. My other bridesmaid got married a few years later, she was furious that her wedding she planned in 2 months was 2 days after I was scheduled to give birth. I wasn\'t her bridesmaid. I don\'t really talk to anyone from my wedding. They either died, or got married themselves and split off from the friend group. No animosity, except for Tina. We just grew apart right away\n\n&gt; **OOP:** In a way, I feel like I have to entertain it because this is my boyfriend\'s cousin who is getting married so I don\'t want to burn bridges in a family. But yeah honestly, this just adds to reasons I hate weddings.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[I have an update on the bride who wanted opinions and got mad...her bachelorette happened...](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/s/idq5v881rJ): **May 12, 2025 (3.5 months later)**\n\nThis weekend, the bride had her bachelorette party. We\'re from Manitoba *(editor\'s note: in Canada)*, so it\'s the bridal party\'s job to plan and pay for the bride to attend.\n\nThe weekend began on Friday at 7pm. We all drove to the bride\'s condo where her and 2 of the other bridesmaids live. We went to Activate and had a blast! We came back after that and had snacks and drinks and did a lingerie shower for the bride, ended with some games and went to bed.\n\nSaturday was where crap hit the fan. We went for brunch in the morning, and then went on a pedal pub. The bride decided it would be a fantastic idea to order 2 punch bowls (margarita and mojito) at the first location and she had about 15 cups of it. She was drunk by our first stop, but her bach, she can enjoy herself. Then we had 2 other stops where she continued to drink and then some of the girls wanted a sangria tower and all hated it but had to drink it anyways. The walk back to the vehicles was slow for the bride. We asked if she\'d be ok and ready to go to a Mexican restaurant for 8. She said yes, so we continued on.\n\nThen the bride started puking, the friend driving had to pull over 4 times for the bride to puke. Some of us suggested maybe ordering pizza, getting into comfy clothes, and watching movies instead of going to this Mexican restaurant that would turn into a club at 10pm. The bride refused and ended up passing out on the bathroom floor back at her condo. I had to go get her some electrolytes. She also puked 2 more times at home.\n\nWe ended up getting ready to leave for the restaurant over an hour later than planned because of the bride passing out. Not a big deal. Now, keep in mind. The bridesmaid that planned most of this bachelorette trip is pregnant and in her first trimester and was dealing with a terrible cold as well.\n\nSo we got to the restaurant and the bride was angry that it was their late night menu because it was after 9pm. She also didn\'t want to drink anything (this is important to know for the rest of the story). So we ate some appetizers and waited for the restaurant to turn into a club. Now, the girls that were there for her all didn\'t know we were clubbing except for 2 of them. So when we heard about this, some girls were confused.\n\nSo 10pm rolled around and the dance floor opened. The only things the bride wanted to do on her bachelorette weekend was get drunk and dance. But she wouldn\'t dance until 12am. At that point, she had made the entire group annoyed because we drove all the way to this place that she loves just for her to not want to dance. Out of 9 girls, 6 of us all hate clubbing, but we were all there to do what she wanted. So her sister who is her maid of honour explained to her that if she wasn\'t going to dance, we would be leaving. It took another half hour of getting the bride out on the dance floor, and at this point, the bridesmaid who planned everything was nauseous from the smell of vaping and needed to go outside and she asked me to come with her. That\'s when she started crying. I asked her what was wrong and the bride (who is this bridesmaid\'s future sister in law) had said to another girl that she just wanted me and her to leave because we weren\'t even dancing with her when we had danced a bunch, but the pregnant one was cramping, tired, and nauseous and felt that everything she was doing wasn\'t good enough for the bride.\n\nAt the end of it all, we left at 1:30am. Everyone was mad at the bride for making such a scene and then of all things, wanting to go clubbing and not even get tipsy. She wasted everyone\'s time, and wasn\'t grateful for anything that was planned for her. She complained the entire time, and made all of us feel horrible for trying to plan something fun.\n\nNow that this weekend is done, we\'re counting down for when her wedding is over. This has been a crap show.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** I think y\'all should just not take her seriously at all and do what makes you happy. That B doesn\'t care for you, so why should you care for her?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** At this point, I don\'t give a royal crap about anything for her wedding. She says 1 thing, then another thing, and has zero respect for those who are there for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; She is having a social 2 weeks before their wedding, and it goes from 8pm-2am. Due to medication I take for migraines, I cannot stay until that time and drive myself home safely because my meds make me sleepy. So, I told her that, she wasn\'t happy and I don\'t really care. I also hate wedding socials, clubbing, all of those things. She has no respect for those of us with limits.\n\n**OOP explains what a wedding social is**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** A Manitoba thing where you have tickets that people can buy and at the social, they can buy drinks and tickets for prizes and all of that money goes to the bridal couple. A Manitoba way of saying “get drunk and give us money”\n\n**Commenter 2:** Honestly it sounds like this woman is about to lose all of her friends because she can’t communicate, doesn’t appreciate anyone’s efforts to try to figure out what she wants, and then shuts down and blames them instead of taking accountability. Best of luck with the wedding since I’m sure you’ve all paid for dresses and everything, but know it is possible for you to still drop out if you want to and I think it’d be justified.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She is becoming quite the piece of work. She is in my wedding as well, and she\'s been quite difficult to deal with. But she\'s on a short leash with me. I don\'t want to kick her out of my wedding party, because I was kicked out of one that was in the family, and that caused a lot of issues. So, I don\'t mind having her there so long as she has some respect for those around her. She will get told that she can\'t get hammered\n\n**Commenter 3:** Good lord. Between the wedding flowers/colors and this... how are you friends?\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Honestly, I\'m trying to chop it all up to be the stress she had with trying to get into medical school. She didn\'t end up getting in. But she texted me earlier this week to ask if we could have a conversation to clear the air because she felt there was tension. I explained to her that she had been very disrespectful and ungrateful. She didn\'t respect the fact that no matter how many times I explained, my medication makes me very sleepy so it\'s hard to stay up late. The most recent time I explained this to her (AGAIN) was the Friday of her bachelorette party. She came back to me and said that she didn\'t understand the specifics of why I took medication, but she would\'ve been willing to come to a mutual agreement had she known. That just straight up ripped me because I have now explained this to her 3 times in a span of a week and each time, she claims I\'ve said nothing and I have the texts to prove it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Well those of you who have stuck around for the wedding from hell after the bachelorette from hell, heres some more](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/s/sc8aNk4pjj): **June 19, 2025 (a bit over one month later)**\n\nThe wedding from hell is this Saturday and the groom texted the pregnant bridesmaid this to pass along to the rest of us. I have zero words. Check out my profile for the other parts of this story. Who would even send this?

This is such disgusting and childish behaviour. This is 100% directed at me because I’m getting married in October and the bride has mentioned that she gave me permission to get married in the same year and I should be grateful\n\n**Commenter 2:** Wait, he sent this to his PREGNANT SISTER ?!? The one who planned this girl’s entire bachelorette party - thoughtfully I might add - only to be treated like shit? The bride’s FSIL? JFC this bride suuuuuucks\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That’s right. Now we’re all supposed to stay the night with the bride too. I was looking for every excuse in the dang book to not spend the night. I was planning on having a quiet morning before the mess and go for a walk to clear my head, drink coffee, and now it’s not going to happen. Idk what to do. I was even going to do a speech to be nice, but I literally have nothing nice to say. And I’m the one bringing 3 mirrors and 2 huge coolers for them to borrow for drinks at the wedding and I’m ready to “forget” them all.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Yeah, the text is requesting for people to focus on her wedding \"for the next two days so she can have her moment\". Er, um, a moment is a brief time (I think technically 90 seconds, but I won\'t be particular here), not two entire self-absorbed days! -- and that probably on top of weeks if not months of similar demands and displays of self-absorption.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It\'s just the part \"so for the next 2 days, I don\'t care if you want to get married, or are getting married, or are married or anything, please, please for us, for the next 2 days can we just keep this about the \\[bride\'s\\] wedding so she can have her moment.\" is what really rips my gitch. This is directed at me 100%. She has hated that we ended up getting engaged and are getting married in the same year as her. Her maid of honour is her sister and she\'s getting married in August, so you can only imagine what the dynamic in her family is currently like.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Here\'s the wedding update you have all been waiting for...](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/s/XHt86qcSb6): **June 22, 2025 (three days later)**\n\nThe day began on Friday. After a bunch of thinking, it wasn\'t worth the fight with the bride to not stay the night, so I stayed. \n\n2 of her bridesmaids tried to make the excuse that it would make more sense for them to drive and hour and a half back home and then come back for 8am the next day. So we bullied them into staying even though they tried to say they wouldn\'t sleep good. Well, it didn\'t matter if we didn\'t have a good sleep because it wasn\'t our wedding.\n\nWe got up what felt like bright and early on Saturday morning after getting into bed at 1am and we hit the ground running. Hairstylist showed up at 8, and that began the getting process. We only technically had to be ready for around 3pm, but with 6 girls to get their hair done, it does take time. \n\nAnyways, we had brunch, got our hair done, and watched the bride battle with doing her own makeup and her eyelashes not cooperating with her burgundy mascara. I just laughed. I was in the process of putting false eyelash clusters on and doing my own makeup to really invest in her issues. She was being incredibly critical of everyone’s makeup, telling them to blend more, bronze more, and make it super glowy. \n\nThis bride didn’t gift anyone anything, except her sister, whom she bought shorts and a sweater from Aritiza. I was a little confused, but maybe not giving your bridal party anything to thank them for going through hell with you is normal.\n\nHer parents also don’t like to use air conditioning, so the temperature in the house was so bad (26º degrees Celsius) *(editor\'s note: approximately 79 degrees)*, and we were in shorts and hoodies as requested by the bride. \n\nThen, about 15 minutes before the photographer arrived, the bride sent me and another bridesmaid to go and get the wedding bands and other small details from the groom, because she forgot about flatlay shots, so we rushed to the grooms house to go and get those things, and we made it back with a few minutes to spare.\n\nDuring the rush of everything going on, the bride was still finishing her vows…\n\nWe eventually went outside for the bride to have a private moment with her mom to put her dress on and do her first look with her dad, that’s when things continued to drag on. The bride was freaking out and panicking through it all. Then we did our first look with her, got her back inside and prepped to do her first look with her soon to be husband, and then things started to fall even further behind.\n\nWe at that point needed to be at the wedding ceremony location for 5pm, for bridal party photos, and the bride and groom only showed up for 5:30. At this point, we were running around trying to make sure last minute things were in place. \n\nWe started to learn and hear about things that had gotten lost in the midst of moving things under the cover of the tent in case the potential rain came overnight. The guys were sent to the ceremony location the morning of to put everything back, and the bride should’ve known that things were going to get lost if there wasn’t anyone there to make sure they got the location of items right. She had a friend as her day of coordinator, and that person should’ve been there.\n\nThe first thing lost was the guestbook. It was placed into a box, and then put off where no one knew where it went. We ended up finding it about 10 minutes before the ceremony…then when we were trying to find the pens, the bride said she ended up losing them, and we had to find something else. We were on a farm, with no house on it, nothing. And every pen and sharpie we tried didn’t work. Then we lost all of the decorations like flowers that were supposed to go on the guest book table. \n\nThen came wedding party photos. We started with the girls, and I noticed a dark spot on the brides dress in a few places and realized it was blood so I said something to the bride, and that’s when crap HIT the fan–the bride’s period had started. This is where I had to laugh, because I knew this would happen, because our cycles have been always one week apart and I just had mine. So obviously, panic set in for her and we had to fix this. So we rushed her to the porta potties to help her fix things. We used double sided sticky tape and safety pins to get things covered because she didn’t want to use a tide to go pen. Then the groom started yelling at me to go and get safety pins and I had ZERO idea where those were, and someone came with a few. This is why you make a wedding day emergency kit. \n\nWe eventually fixed the situation, and we were already behind with the bride and groom needing to start family photos.\n\nWe continued to run around even more, and then the bridal party started to get hungry. Both the bride and the groom said they would be giving us supper, and they didn’t give us any…so you can only imagine after being in the heat all day, and only having brunch, you get a little hungry later in the evening. \n\nSo no supper, and it quickly moved to 7pm and it was time to start the ceremony and we had to get the brides’ veil back in, after she took it out for bridal party photos, and I gave it to her dad with the bobby pins to put it back in the camper that was on the yard, and he lost the bobby pins so another bridesmaid took a bunch out of her hair to secure the veil. \n\nThen, while we were waiting to all go out, the bride was pissed about how the bottles of wine and water were arranged on the tables and started to yell at us to rearrange it all, and she was also MIA for 20 minutes before this and we eventually found her freaking out in the camper. \n\nThe ceremony began, it went well, no one fainted thank goodness, but I thought the bride would after she had only had a sip of water all day, and almost no food. \n\nThen, we all stayed until 3 am to make the couple happy.\n\nThe disorganization of so many aspects of this wedding was enough to blast me into orbit. Being yelled at by the groom to bring safety pins when I had no idea where they were was horrible, some of her bridesmaids were useless and just kept sitting down instead of helping with things that were needed.  The groom was also calling the bride a bunch of times during the morning because he didn’t know where things went, and it made her freak out, but we couldn’t tell him to quit it.\n\nSo glad this wedding is over.\n\nFinally, the bride is going to continue working towards her master\'s and will be living an hour and a half away from her husband during the week for the next 6 years. She will also keep trying to get into medical school during this time. So I\'m not quite sure how you have a successful marriage when you only see each other 2 days a week. But, she wants to keep living with her roommates, and her husband doesn\'t want to move to be close to her and have the opportunity to actually live together.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[*Fixed* Wedding update. Call me what you want, but we tried to support the bride the best we could, and the bride was happy everyone stayed with her for night. It wasn\'t about us, it was about the bride.](https://reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/1lih4fv/fixed_wedding_update_call_me_what_you_want_but_we/): **June 23, 2025 (next day)**\n\nDeleted my last post, we\'re trying this again. Here\'s the bullet point list of the wedding day from hell.\n\n\\• After setting up for the wedding in the blistering heat, being eaten alive by flies and mosquitoes, we managed to convince the 2 bridesmaids coming from an hour and a half out of town to stay. The maid of honour, pregnant bridesmaid, and myself all decided to stay for the night, because it would mean a lot to the bride. If a pregnant bridesmaid can sleep on an air mattress, so can the rest of us. We explained it would be uncomfy for all of us, especially the pregnant one, but if it made the bride happy, we were happy to support her in that way, and then we all could sleep in.\n\n\\• Hair began at 8am. The brides parents do not like to use air conditioning, so the temperature in the house was 26º Celsius. Our hair all fell, the frizz was insane for some, and we were all very uncomfortable in our hoodies the bride wanted us to wear.\n\n\\• The bride didn\'t give anyone except her sister who was her maid of honour a gift for being in the wedding party. Typically you do give something, but when you spend $5000 on your flowers, I can see why you don\'t have money for much else.\n\n\\• The only food we at all day was brunch. The bride and groom didn\'t give us any supper. So we were a little hungry, and it was a dessert wedding. We pigged out on the late night snack of hot dogs later on in the night.\n\n\\• We did our own makeup. The bride was incredibly critical of everyone (except me because I apparently I looked professional done lol). Her mascara wasn\'t working the way she wanted it to, ended up causing her to have a freak out session.\n\n\\• The bride didn\'t finish her vows until 5 minutes before her and her husband did them privately. That created an unnecessary amount of panic in her all morning.\n\n\\• The groom kept calling her the morning of to freak out about where things went at the ceremony location. Things were moved under the tent in case rain came overnight and the groom and groomsmen had to put it all back the morning of and LOST a bunch of things.\n\n\\• 15 minutes before the photographer arrived, the bride realized she wanted flat lay/detail shots so we had to rush to the grooms house to get his cologne, and wedding bands.\n\n\\• We were then told to get into our dresses and then spend well over an hour outside while the bride put on her dress with her mom. So the second photographer took a bunch of different pictures with us bridesmaids which ended up being a lot of fun.\n\n\\• First looks happened, tears were shed, then the bride and groom started to run incredibly far behind.\n\n\\• We were sent to the ceremony location, where disaster struck. The groom and groomsmen put many things in the wrong spot, lost the guest book, the bride lost her fancy guest book pens, florals were lost that were meant for the guest book table, and the bride and groom didn\'t give us any supper even though they told us they would have supper for us.\n\n\\• We did bridal party photos, and then during bridesmaid photos, we noticed blood on the bride\'s dress. On route to the ceremony location, her period started so she had some big blood spots. The groom yelled at me for not knowing where safety pins were because the bride didn\'t tell anyone where she may have extra. She didn\'t make a wedding emergency kit, so we were running around trying to find things.\n\n\\• Then the bride wanted her veil put back in after wedding party photos, but her dad lost the bobby pins even though I gave them to him with the viel and said to put them together in the camper and not to lose any of them–he lost them. I was pulled in another direction while trying to get the viel into the camper because the groom needed something else.\n\n\\• We later found the guest book after most guests had arrived. But all of the pens and sharpies didn\'t work, until someone had a random one in their vehicle that worked.\n\n\\• Then we lost the bride for 20 minutes. Later to find out she was hiding in the camper freaking out because she didn\'t know if she was ready to get married.\n\n\\• Just before we were all going to walk down the aisle, the bride was freaking out about how the water and bottles of wine were arranged on the table, and started to yell at all of us that it needed to be fixed. Her dad had to talk her down and tell her that it was not time to be upset about that and that it was time to walk down the aisle.\n\n\\• We all stayed until 3 am to make the couple happy.\n\n\\• This wedding was incredibly unorganized, so glad it\'s over.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** What in the world is a \"dessert wedding\"? Something people do when their too cheap to properly feed their guests? I feel sorry for the pregnant woman not getting adequately fed. What a trashy and inconsiderate bride.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** We only had dessert, not an actual meal. And a bunch of their aunts made dessert, so they didn\'t pay for it. But yeah, it\'s a real cheap way of getting out of making sure guests are fed. I\'ve been to 1 other wedding like this, but they an appetizer bar which was stocked all night and was delicious!\n\n**Commenter 2:** Was this part of the update where you helped the bride to “bully” two bridesmaids to staying the night when they didn’t want to?\n\nShe was awful, but you also behaved awfully just so you could make het happy. This whole thing sounds insufferable.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I mean it when I say it, that we were kind to these girls. We explained nicely, that the bride wanted this, but never communicated it clearly. She lives with these girls and she wanted them to be there and not make the long drive home. They would\'ve had 4 hours of sleep. We said to them that if they stayed, they\'d get a lot more sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; I shouldn\'t have said bullying because we didn\'t do that. We stayed for the bride. It\'s what she wanted, the entire wedding wasn\'t about us. If I didn\'t want to stay, I didn\'t have to, but we did it out of kindness for her because it was something she really wanted.\n&gt; \n&gt; This wedding wasn\'t about us, it was about the bride and trying to do something to make her happy. The girls who lived further away ended up sleeping super well and were grateful to have stayed, and they were staying the night at the bride\'s parents house after the wedding anyways.\n\n**Commenter 3:** What did she do about the bloodstains on her dress? Did she have a spare?\n\n&gt; **OOP:**No...the groom asked if she had a back up dress. But we just covered the stains by flipping those sides of the dress and taping them with double sided sticky tape and using safety pins to pin other pieces back, and you couldn\'t tell what we did at all.\n\n**OOP on the bride treating the bridal party badly**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Yeah, she did treat us like crap. The stress of a wedding is no excuse to treat us like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; I get that weddings bring out the worst in people. For my own, I\'m being considerate of the fact that my maid of honour will be 8 months pregnant, but she is still determined to be up there with me, and I\'ve said to her that she doesn\'t have to. But we are making sure a lawn chair will come with during pictures so she can sit down in between. My sister will also be 4 months postpartum and she still wants to be in my wedding, she will be nursing at the head table, and I don\'t care because I love my new nephew.\n&gt; \n&gt; This bride didn\'t let her nephew come to their wedding.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Editor’s note: This is concluded that the wedding is over, and OOP has deleted her account**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ojpwq4/bride_wants_advice_and_opinions_and_then_keeps/', 1619, 412, '2025-10-30 04:00:06', '2025-11-08 01:36:53');

(467, 'reddit', '1oozauz', 'Parasitic reward design, and unfulfilling grinds', 'For the vast majority of MMOs, boss rewards are handled in a similar way. Any given item is not particularly uncommon, however it’s time restricted. Daily or weekly loot lockouts are the most common, preventing you from repeating the same content over and over to get the item you want.\n\nOld School RuneScape is the outlier - It *wants* you to repeat that same content over and over to get what you want. The grind is so intrinsically linked with the fabric of the game that it’s the subject of countless memes, YouTube series, Reddit posts - and *nothing* beats getting spooned.\n\nOver the years a couple of different loot design paradigms have emerged, with very strong and differing opinions on their design. As the game matures and as players improve, some patterns have emerged which I think are worth discussing.\n\n# Chapter 1 - The 1/128 Lottery\n\nBack during RuneScape Classic, the core idea behind meaningful drops was the Rare Drop Table. This was where the most powerful items in the game were placed, and in order to make difficult enemies worth killing they all had a different chance of rolling the rare drop table.\n\nThe first repeatable boss in RuneScape was the King Black Dragon. At the time the core of his loot table was an incredibly high chance of rolling the RDT, and a specific additional 1/128 chance of rolling a Dragon Med, the second rarest powerful item in the game. Generally speaking he didn’t drop too much else, and really you were there for the Dragon Med or the Left Half. The increased rate was offset by the KBD being in deep wilderness, requiring an incredibly risky trek in your valuable gear to get to.\n\nWhen the second boss was added two years later, the Kalphite Queen, the same core concept was kept. A few random drops, a decently high chance of rolling the RDT, and a 1/128 chance of rolling a Dragon Chainbody, the new big ticket item. KQ was put deep in a dungeon (at the time) far in the desert, again requiring a risky trek.\n\nIn the middle of 2005, we got the Dagganoth Kings. This was the first real attempt at multiplayer content, with three bosses who all required a different combat style to kill. The original intent was to go and kill them with two of your friends, one person taking each combat style and focusing on their respective king. Again the drop table follows the same core paradigm as KBD and KQ, with insignificant general loot but a 1/128 chance for the big ticket item, in this case the combat rings. It also follows the paradigm of difficult access, with them being at the end of a huge dungeon that required two friends to assist with the various traps and doors.\n\n**The Outliers**\n\nDuring this time, there were two notable outliers to this core design.\n\nThe first major departure was Barrows. Not only did Barrows have a huge number of items that could be dropped, the frequency of getting one of those drops was *incredibly* high compared to the prior examples. It also dropped a notable number of runes, meaning for the first time there was actual value outside of the big ticket items. This was offset by barrows being 6 bosses in a row, and having an incredibly long trek for each and every attempt.\n\nThe second major outlier was added in 2006 with the rework of Falador - The Giant Mole. The mole was very different, instead of a rare chance for a big ticket item, the mole had no big ticket item. Instead, she dropped mole parts *every kill*, which could be traded for birds nests. My understanding is that this was done to fix the supply of tree seeds from the relatively new farming, as well as fix the supply of nests for Sara Brews.\n\n**The Escalation**\n\nFinally, slightly after the OSRS backup but still fundamentally 2007 content, we had the first major difficulty spike and escalation in what RuneScape bossing could be - The God Wars Dungeon. Again we see the same fundamental design - Long runs to each boss with an additional requirement of killing mobs in the dungeon to gain access, fairly irrelevant resource drops, and big ticket items.\n\nInterestingly, the 1/128 paradigm is still largely followed for a number of the core GWD boss drops, although in a slightly different manner. There’s a 1/128 chance for any piece of Armadyl Armour or Bandos Armour, and a 1/128 chance for the “Main” drop of the other two bosses, namely the Saradomin Sword, Zamorakian Spear, and Steam Battlestaff. This did mean that a given item was a good bit more rare, but generally speaking the flow of items was as consistent as older bosses.\n\nThis was the first time however that substantially rarer items were really experimented with, namely the Godsword hilts. These were an incredibly rare 1/508, cementing themselves as huge, rare, big ticket drops. The blade shards were even rarer, however since they were shared across all bosses and the hilts swapped freely they were relatively speaking more common.\n\nBecause the bosses dropped *so many* unique items, the actual unique chance from each boss was actually incredibly generous. Kree’arra and Gaardor both have a \\~1/73 chance of a unique, Zilyana a \\~1/53, and K’ril a massive \\~1/42 (using the osrs table). Even though a given item can be rare, the actual chance of getting a win is pretty high.\n\nFor the first time however it did change something fundamental about how items had been dropped - If you didn’t get your shards before your hilt, the hilt was useless. Put a pin in this, it will be relevant later.\n\n# Chapter 2 - Feast and Famine\n\nWhile I could continue going over every boss released individually throughout the life of OSRS, for this chapter I’m going to focus on one boss that exemplifies each core archetype taken to it’s extreme.\n\n**Feast**\n\nThe first of the big OSRS endgame bosses to be released was Zulrah. Like the GWD bosses, Zulrah had some fairly rare, big ticket items on it’s loot table. However again, since there were multiple items, the actual odds of hitting any rare was 1/128. This meant that Zulrah generally speaking dropped items at a rate comparable to the bosses that had come before it, but with one notable difference.\n\nUnlike those bosses, Zulrah dropped a *lot* of resources.\n\nEven if you didn’t hit the big ticket items, you still received so many drops that you were always going to incrementally profit. Luck wasn’t a factor, all you had to do was kill the boss and it was guaranteed to be worth your time.\n\nThis had two profound effects. The first is that the big ticket items largely became worthless, as the value in killing the boss was elsewhere. The second is that in dropping so many skilling resources, it creates a vicious feedback loop that disincentivises all gathering skills. [I’ve written about this at length in the past](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1jjeowf/optimising_the_fun_out_of_a_game_by_removing_pain/), but the knock on effects to the wider game are incredibly deep and disruptive.\n\n[Using this money making guide as reference](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Killing_Zulrah), when removing the big ticket items you can still expect to see \\~1,250,752gp/hr in incremental loot. This feels great for the player in that every kill feels worthwhile, but does have pretty clear downsides.\n\n**Famine**\n\nWhen The Nightmare was released, there was a lot of discussion about Zulrah style drop tables and bosses dropping huge amounts of resources. To counter this and get back to the good old days of big ticket drops, The Nightmare was released following the “Old” paradigm of boss drops with rare big ticket items, and a low resource droprate.\n\nUnlike GWD however, the rates were *astronomical*.\n\nI’ll use Phosani’s Nightmare with the current rates as a comparison here, as it’s slightly easier to compare like for like.\n\n[Killing Kree’arra](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Killing_Kree%27arra) nets a profit of around 5.2m gp/hr. [Killing Phosani’s Nightmare](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Killing_Phosani%27s_Nightmare) nets a profit of around 4.7m gp/hr. While on the surface that might seem comparable, the kill weighting of these is anything but.\n\nAny unique from Kree is \\~1/73. At max you can get around 27 kills per hour, so you can expect a unique once every \\~2.7 hours.\n\nAny unique from Phosani’s is \\~1/113. At max you can get around 8 kills per hour, so you can expect a unique once every \\~14.1 hours.\n\nThis means that simply hitting anything of note is *five times* rarer than Kree, and you can easily go days without hitting anything.\n\nNot only that, but the rarest item on Kree’s drop table is 1/762, \\~28 hours on rate, whereas the rarest item on Phosani’s table is 1/1,600, \\~*200 hours* on rate.\n\nIn addition, Phosani’s is *only* worthwhile in the uniques. Costs less expected incremental drops, you can expect to spend 89,825gp/hr simply for the chance of hitting the lottery ticket.\n\n**Exhaustion**\n\nEven though most of those bosses seem pretty similar in terms of expected return, clearly The Nightmare has a reputation for a reason. Everything is so incredibly rare that it results in a seemingly insurmountable dearth of return, and people quickly get fatigued with the grind.\n\nZulrah on the other hand feels great to farm, but has serious knock on effects for the wider economy due to the resources that are dropped.\n\nNow, all of this is assuming we’re sitting in an idealised box, and that we will get the items exactly on rate. However that’s not how this works, and starts getting to the heart of the issue.\n\n# Chapter 3 - Dry Spoons\n\nGetting spooned always feels amazing, right?\n\nYou’re a baby iron who’s decided to go and do Rex early in order to get a Berserker ring, and you manage to get one on your first trip. The feeling is incredible, you don’t have to come back here for ages and you’ve got a massive supercharge to your account nice and early.\n\nGoing dry always sucks, doesn’t it?\n\nYou’re a baby iron who’s decided to go and do Rex early in order to get a Berserker ring, and you’ve sailed past the 1/128 droprate. You’re trapped in this cave, you wish you had just waited until you had a slayer task, and you have absolutely no idea of knowing how long you’re going to be stuck here for.\n\n**What does it mean to be unlucky?**\n\nAt this point, it’s relatively well known that 1/128 doesn’t mean you will get a drop in 128 kills.\n\nTo work out the odds of having a single drop, we use the simple formula of `P=1−(1−p)^n`. For a 1/128 chance, this would be `P=1-(127/128)^n`, where `n` is the number of trials.\n\nOn average, you have a 63.4% chance to have received a drop by kill 128, and the 50% chance mark is around kill 89.\n\nThis can very simply be plotted on a graph;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cs7apcnd0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa292064269f34d0a7355aa3d195d7a203612fb\n\nNotably, this graph never *quite* reaches 100%.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that while the average person will get “spooned” with \\~63% of people getting the drop before the rate, because the upper rate is unbound you will have people go *unfathomably* dry.\n\n10%, or 1 in 10 people, will require more than 294 kills. 1%, or 1 in 100 people, will require more than 587 kills. 0.1%, or 1 in 1000 people, will require more than 875 kills.\n\nThere are only 128 chances to be spooned, but there are *infinite* chances to go dry.\n\n**Exponentials**\n\nNow, when you have relatively low drop rates, this isn’t too bad. However as the rates start to increase, it begins to become a real problem.\n\nTake for example the Kree scenario from earlier, and let’s graph that. As a reminder, the rarest unique from Kree is 1/762.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q02ztige0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba708a255a15d0d41317fc65036812d5153e343\n\nNow our numbers are starting to get pretty big. In order to hit the 50% we’re looking at 528 kills, but we’re starting to get substantial percentages of people going into the thousands. 7.33% of people will go over 2000 kills without the drop, that’s pretty substantial. The unluckiest 1% of people will go over 3504.\n\nNow let’s do the same for Phosani’s Nightmare, as a reminder with a 1/1600 drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv8j5o4f0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffd8492225a84433fce420ed91d3ddc6e28999e1\n\n15.33% of people will go over 3000 kills dry. 10% of people will go beyond 3683. And the unluckiest 1% that we mentioned would go over 3504 for Kree? *7358 kills*.\n\nAt a rate of 27 kills an hour for Kree, that’s \\~130 hours. For Phosani? \\~*470*.\n\nAnd this is the [revised drop rate](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Project_Rebalance:_Combat_Changes#Miscellaneous_Combat-Adjacent_Changes), it used to be 1/3000. At that rate, around 10% of people would go beyond 6906 kills, and the unlucky 1%? *13,799 kills*.\n\n**Infinites**\n\nClearly there is an issue here that compounds incredibly quickly as you start to ramp the numbers up. Because you’re never able to hit a 100% likelihood of the drop having happened regardless of how high the kill count goes, the lower you start making the drop rates the more people will get caught in the well of unending thirst.\n\nYou could increase the drop rate to skew the odds back towards a reasonable number, but if you start doing that then by nature you add more items into the economy and start to lower their value.\n\nThis then begs the question, how can you mitigate this problem to prevent going incredibly dry without adding more items into the game on average?\n\n# Chapter 4 - Mitigation\n\nOver the last few years, there have been a few attempts to mitigate the incredible dry potential without making items overall more common, and one of them is pretty clever.\n\n**Rings**\n\nThe Desert Treasure 2 bosses have a unique solution to this problem.\n\nTo pick on the rarest, the Ultor Vestage from Vardorvis, there is a 1/1,088 chance of it dropping. If we were to graph an item with that rate, we would see the following;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4z82qtf0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=848174ca5216e37f0c7a00e4b9c51885389f5c52\n\nThe 50% mark here is 754 kills, and the “rate” mark is again 63.23%. This looks pretty painful, with 10% of people going over 2504 kills and 1% going over 5003.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t work quite like any other item. Instead of simply rolling a 1/1088, it rolls a \\~1/362.66. After this roll has succeeded three times, the item is dropped.\n\nWhile the average number of items coming into the game per kill works out at 1 for every 1088 kills, the odds for a given player dramatically shift.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t4m1njg0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6e801a01c7408c0a1592158ea01894350a2b41b\n\nThe blue line above is the standard 1/1088 drop, and the red line is the odds of getting three 1/362.66 drops.\n\nAs you can see, we get a pretty interesting pattern. While the likelihood of being spooned clearly decreases, we get a substantial improvement to the likelihood of going dry.\n\nNow, our 10% number is 1929 kills, and out 1% number is 3044 kills - 575 lower and 1959 lower respectively, which is a *massive* number of people no longer going dry.\n\nThe downside, however, is that the average person will have to do more kills. Now the 50% mark is at 970 kills instead of 754, and the “rate” mark is 57.71% instead of 63.23%.\n\nThe question is, is this worth it? Is it worth protecting those going incredibly unlucky at the cost of making everyone have to, on average, play a bit more?\n\n**Seeds**\n\nThe Desert Treasure 2 bosses weren’t actually the first boss with this sort of design in mind, though you might not realise it.\n\nThe same fundamental system was implemented with The Gauntlet, and Crystal armour seeds.\n\nA full set of Crystal Armour requires 6 seeds. The seeds are all the same, and you need 6 for a full set. This means that at 1/50 per seed, a full set of Crystal Armour has some *incredibly* strong inherent dry protection compared to a raw 1/300, as you can see below;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldon1cbh0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2864d6743f8ab274ec032ea5e274dfcbcbfb34\n\nThe 50% mark is around 283 kills, the 10% mark is 462 kills, and the 1% mark is 651 kills.\n\nThis is amazing! Yes you can’t truly get spooned, but you’re absolutely not going dry as a bone! If the armour was just a 1/300 drop, then the 10% number is 690 kills and the 1% number is a massive 1378 kills. More than double the current implementation!\n\nSo wait, why is it called the Red Prison?\n\n# Chapter 5 - Parasites\n\nWhen the Crystal Armour was originally concepted, the idea was [an armour set to bring the iconic weapon, The Crystal Bow, into the endgame](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Song_of_the_Elves_Poll_Blog_II#Crystal_Armour). This set would be dropped from new endgame content accessible after completion of Song of the Elves.\n\nAt the time, there was a large backlash over “Making the crystal bow too powerful”, which I must admit never made any sense to me. The armour *was* the weapon, and came from endgame content. The power of the weapon itself was irrelevant, since effectively the armour was what did the damage.\n\nThanks to this the set was released substantially underpowered, and began to rot as a worthless and pointless reward.\n\nIn May 2021 [a proposal was put forward for a new bow to improve the damage of crystal armour](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Equipment_Rebalance:_Ranged_Meta_Proposal#Crystal_Armour). Even though 55% of people polled thought buffing the existing things was a better approach, it was decided that a new bow would be added.\n\nWhile at the time (and now) I fundamentally disagreed with the very concept behind the Bowfa being a separate reward instead of the power of the Crystal Armour + Crystal Bow combo being buffed to that point, the implementation of the Bowfa was done in frankly the worst way possible.\n\nI truly believe this was one of the biggest implementation mistakes ever made.\n\n**Spoon Protection**\n\nThe Bow of Faerdhinen was added as an option to the Enhanced Crystal Weapon Seed, a 1/400 drop from the corrupted gauntlet, the same place as the Crystal Armour.\n\nConsidering that the Crystal Armour was an effective 1/300 drop across all 6 seeds, as a reward it essentially became moot. On average, 8 seeds would enter the game for every bow.\n\nSince the bow is useless without the armour, the average player will bring more armour seeds into the economy than bow seeds, resulting in a fundamental downward economic pressure. In addition, for Ironmen, the only thing that matters really is the bow, you’re going to get the armour passively while grinding for it.\n\nExcept, not quite. Remember that pin I mentioned earlier?\n\nWhat if you get spooned a bow? Now you’ve got to sit there and continue to grind out your Armour. And if you get spooned the Armour? You’ve still got a long way to go for your bow.\n\nBut going dry? Well, now we learn why it’s called the red prison.\n\n**Worst of Bowfa Worlds**\n\nIn order to leave the prison, you require 7 things;\n\n* 6x 1/50 Crystal Armour Seeds\n* 1x 1/400 Crystal Weapon Seed\n\nWe saw the graph for the Crystal Armour Seeds above, but now let’s add the Enhanced Crystal Weapon Seed. The Red line is the armour, the blue line is the bow;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fptg2o6i0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ba58f3a302b887bd4a7b47bdec0b376d6eed1a\n\nEven though the armour is effectively a 1/300, due to the lack of dry protection the bow is *so much worse* at a 1/400.\n\nNot only that, but because the dry protection naturally lowers the chance to be spooned for the Armour seeds, we now have a horrible worst of both worlds situation where you can’t get lucky, and you can get unlucky.\n\nTo make this a bit more clear, here is the graph for “Likelihood of completing the gauntlet in x number of kills”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85rb5upi0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=731e11d5c4ec011a236def382c25dc8a0bcf634d\n\nThe crossover point is roughly at 287 kills, or around 51.3%. This means that, on average, half of the people grinding the Gauntlet will get a Bowfa without finishing their Crystal Armour, meaning the spoon doesn’t matter. And for the other 50%? You’re in for some rough numbers.\n\nFor the bow, the 10% mark is 920 kills, and the 1% mark is 1838 kills. Compared to the 462 and 651 marks respectively for the Crystal Armour, there is a *monumentally higher* chance to go incredibly dry.\n\nAt most you can do about 6 runs per hour, so for the 10% mark that’s 153 hours, and for the unlucky 1% that’s 306 hours. Compare that to the 77 hours and 108.5 hours respectively for the Armour seeds.\n\nNot only has the Crystal Armour failed in it’s core concept to make the Crystal Bow a viable weapon later in the game, the implementation of the Bowfa being dropped from the same content as the armour has resulted in what effectively amounts to \"good luck protection\".\n\nNow you have the negative effect of split, higher chance drops at the lower kill counts, and the negative effect of a single, lower chance drop at the higher kill counts.\n\nThis is why The Gauntlet has such a bad reputation, and this is why it feels uniquely bad across all content.\n\n**Best of Bowfa Worlds?**\n\nWhile it’s unfortunately far too late to go back and prevent the Bowfa from existing (Even though I personally would, and improve the damage bonus from the Crystal Armour + Crystal Bow combo to match current numbers), the horrendous bad luck component of the Enhanced Seed can still be mitigated without materially affecting its rarity.\n\nIf we afford the Enhanced Seed the same effective bad luck protection as the Armour by making it a 6 internal roll item similar to the Desert Treasure bosses, we can dramatically mitigate bad luck without having as substantial of an effect on good luck as compared to most items.\n\nThe blue line is the current odds for the Enhanced seed, and the red line is a 6 internal roll rate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xw86milj0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77ba56aa59b5ba7e832e1061a1f15f6a110c2157\n\nAs you can see this *massively* decreases the tail, taking the 10% to 616 kills down from 920 kills, and the 1% to 870 kills down from 1838 kills.\n\nDo bear in mind, the Enhanced Seed would be *no more common nor uncommon*, this is simply a redistribution of the weighting of averages.\n\nAnd so finally, I present this chart. The Yellow line is the droprate of 6 Armour seeds, the Blue line is the current droprate of the Enhanced Seed, and the red line is the proposed droprate of the Enhanced seed;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu1cpzdk0fzf1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23f0d2030cd2d7c227c721707938d2ffa4d4092a\n\nThe red shaded area includes people who would, on average, take more kills to complete the gauntlet than presently. The green shaded area includes people who would take less kills to complete the gauntlet than presently.\n\nAs you can see, the red area is *far* smaller than the green area, even though the number of seeds being dropped into the economy is no different. This is the effect of the Armour seed acting as a floor for being spooned, but the Enhanced seed acting as a ceiling for going dry.\n\nTo compare some figures directly;\n\n|Kills|Odds of Completion Before|Odds of Completion After|Delta|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|100|1.55%|0.41%|\\-1.14%|\n|200|21.33%|8.24%|\\-13.09%|\n|250|38.40%|17.57%|\\-20.83%|\n|287|51.25%|26.33%|\\-24.92%|\n|300|52.81%|29.64%|\\-23.17%|\n|350|58.36%|42.81%|\\-15.70%|\n|378|61.18%|50.08%|\\-11.10%|\n|400|63.26%|55.55%|\\-7.86%|\n|457|68.14%|68.23%|0.08%|\n|500|71.39%|76.06%|4.67%|\n|600|77.73%|88.61%|10.85%|\n|617|78.66%|90.07%|11.41%|\n|700|82.66%|95.08%|12.42%|\n|800|86.50%|98.03%|11.55%|\n|870|88.67%|99.00%|10.33%|\n|920|90.00%|99.39%|9.41%|\n|1838|99.00%|\\~&lt;100%|1.00%|\n\nBelow 456 kills, the odds of completing the gauntlet would be, on average, lower. The largest disparity is at kill 287, where the chance of having received all of the necessary drops is roughly half. However this *very* quickly flips by kill 457, where the chance catches up and very quickly exceeds the current expectation.\n\nAt the point where 50% of players are expected to have the drop, the average number of kills increases from 284 to 378.\n\nBy kill 617, we hit the 90% point for the revised rate. With this, 11.41% of people would be luckier than they would’ve been with the current system.\n\nBy kill 920, at present 10%, or 1 in 10 people will still not have an enhanced seed. With the revised system, only 0.41%, or roughly 1 in 244 people won’t have it.\n\nBy kill 1838, at present 1%, or 1 in 100 people will *still* be stuck in the prison. With the revised system, the exact number is 0.00001502%, or roughly 1 in 6,657,790.\n\n# Chapter 6 - Too Dry To Function\n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend to have big ticket items be incredibly rare as opposed to having many, less rare items. This mindset is understandable from a balance perspective, as bosses with a billion low droprate rewards quite quickly skew the meta.\n\nHowever, while this is good at mitigating the average rates when looked at as a whole, it’s absolutely *crippling* the top end rates.\n\nI truly believe that if rates are going to be as high as they are, bad luck protection is *essential*. Personally I would make sure that any given item doesn’t have a 1% value more than double the base drop chance, but this obviously very much depends on the average kill length.\n\nI know this had a lot of maths and graphs, but a lot of this isn’t particularly intuitive and the nuance of some of the interactions with the Gauntlet takes a fair bit of explaining.\n\n# tl;dr\n\nThe Gauntlet has “Good Luck Protection” due to a quirk of design with the drop rates for the Crystal Armour and Bowfa, and it substantially lowers the chance of getting spooned below 287 kills while raising the chance of going unfathomably dry.\n\nDue to this, there is substantially less detriment to changing the Enhanced Crystal Weapon Seed to work like the DT2 bosses, with 6 fake 1 in 66.67 “rolls” before the item drops. This would substantially benefit around 1/3 of players, or anyone who takes over 457 kills. The unlucky 10% would need to do around 303 fewer kills, and the unluckiest 1% would need to do around 968 fewer kills. This would also not change the overall number of enhanced seeds coming into the economy.', 'Jademalo', '2007scape', 'https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1oozauz/parasitic_reward_design_and_unfulfilling_grinds/', 1195, 617, '2025-11-05 10:26:26', '2025-11-08 01:36:53'),
(468, 'reddit', '1o4fe5p', 'AITAH for wearing the watch my ex gave me?', '**I am NOT OOP, OOP is u/itslippyout**\n\n**Originally posted to r/TwoHotTakes**\n\n**AITAH for wearing the watch my ex gave me?**\n\n**Thanks to u/queenlegolas for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!manipulation, job loss, insecurity!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/SMGfPkQUzU): **October 1, 2025**\n\nWhen I (currently 29m) was still dating my ex girlfriend, she gifted me a nice watch on my 25th birthday. For some context, her employer payed her a salary of 92K per year, plus a living allowance as she often travelled for work. They provided her a company vehicle, phone, and the allowance covered her rent/hotel and food. So with most of her basic living expenses being covered, she had a lot of disposable income and had amassed a significant savings. The watch she bought was by no means a Rolex but I believe it was a couple thousand dollars. It is the only nice watch I own, my other watches being a cheap timex from when I was in college and an Apple Watch.\n\nFast forward a year and a half and we ended up breaking up. Her company ended up moving its base of operations to a different city and she was only able to visit by flying here on weekends and it just wasn’t working. (She did ask for the watch back but I said no, it was a gift - but that’s a different story)\n\nNow, my current girlfriend (26f) who I’ve been dating now for just over a year - seems to have a problem with the watch. I don’t wear it often, usually on occasions. She’s brought up before that I should sell the watch for some extra cash, but like I said before it’s my only “nice” watch. Last weekend we went out to celebrate our first anniversary. We got dressed up and went to a nice restaurant and I wore my watch. She didn’t notice until we got to the restaurant and sat down, when she saw it she immediately asked why I wore it. I asked why I wouldn’t, since we were getting dressed up nice, why shouldn’t I wear my nicest watch and only piece of jewelry? She said it’s disrespectful to be wearing something gifted to me by my ex while celebrating our anniversary.\n\nI don’t cherish the watch because of who gave it to me, I have no emotional or sentimental feelings about the watch - it’s just a nice watch that I’d never be able to afford on what I make. I took the watch off at this point and slipped it into my pocket to try and save the evening but it ruined her mood for the night. She wasn’t interested in conversation and was short with everything she said to me. Silent on the drive home, and then immediately went to bed.\n\nI asked her the next day why the watch bothered her so much when it has no emotional significance to me. She just said she didn’t want to talk about the watch anymore and went about scrolling on her phone. Over the next day she got over it but now I feel like I’m not allowed to wear my watch anytime we go out together.\n\nFor some additional context - she has expressed she doesn’t like my ex as we broke up on good terms and spoke regularly. The break up wasn’t messy it was just a matter of circumstances, we both were unhappy and it was nobody’s fault. When my current girlfriend and I got together she said she didn’t want me texting with my ex (who I still considered a friend) and asked to look through our previous conversations which I allowed and then stopped texting her. She always seemed insecure about my previous relationship and I’ve done my best to try and alleviate her concerns but i figured she would get over it in time as our relationship solidified.\n\nI don’t think wearing the watch was that big of a deal, maybe I could sell it and use the money to put towards a different nice watch? I’m not sure if watches retain value well enough for it to be worth that but even so I feel like that’s just the new watch is still indirectly being paid for with the gift my ex gave me? Or do I just put it in a box and stick it in the back of our closet?\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NTA, these are her insecurities that she is allowing to rule your relationship together. You clearly are not dwelling on this past relationship and you have already made reasonable (and honestly unreasonable) accommodations for her discomfort. I understand current partners not wanting active communication between exes, but why did she need to look through your messages? That’s an invasion of privacy and a lack of trust on her part, I would personally find that very disrespectful. Keep your watch, if it continues to be an issue y’all then need to think about couples therapy to work this out\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I think she just wanted to see that our relationship was really over. Parting on good terms and still regularly talking to your ex is a concern I can understand. Nothing to really hide there, costs me nothing that I care about to let her look through the messages. I’m not a fan of asking to go through a phone but I could understand why she might be concerned early on in our relationship. But now it just feels unnecessary.\n\n**Commenter 2:** NTA, but if you just like it because it\'s expensive, you could probably sell and buy one that you pick out and like better and solve your issue (well, at least partially). If you actually love the design, then tough cookies for your girlfriend. Regardless, she needs to learn to get over your friendship of resentment and will just keep building. Still, I can see why she\'d not be thrilled with you keepijg a relationship with the ex you\'d still be with if she didn\'t move away.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** That’s just it - I understand her not wanting me talking to my ex given we were still close after our breakup. I do like the design of the watch and not just the price. I admittedly have bad taste - so I’m hesitant to drop money on a new watch when I might pick out something tacky hahaha\n\n**Commenter 3:** If you are still in communication with your ex, then yeah I don’t blame her for feeling insecure. You’re not making her feel secure.\n\nIf you don’t talk with your ex, I think it’s been long enough that it really shouldn’t matter, especially bc you like the watch not because your ex gives it meaning but because it is a ‘luxury’ piece.\n\nEven if you bought a new watch by selling your old one, you are still using the money she used to gift you the watch in the first place, so it somehow still ties back to your ex?\n\nIt really doesn’t make sense to me personally to get so mad over such a thing.\n\nMaybe she is upset because of the simple face that your ex picked it out for you? She is definitely insecure and I do not believe you are in the wrong.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I don’t talk to my ex - after she asked me to stop talking to her, I sent my ex one message (which I told her about beforehand) and it was to explain that I wouldn’t be messaging her anymore, and why, just so that she wouldn’t be messaging me and wondering why I wasn’t replying and we haven’t spoken since.\n\n**OOP responds to a downvoted comment on lying to his GF about where he got his watch** \n\n&gt; **OOP:** I’m the asshole because I didn’t lie to her and say I bought the watch on my 54k a year salary? And who else would buy me a couple thousand dollar watch? It would literally never occur to me to lie about who bought the watch. And like I said, maybe I will sell it. I’ll be looking into it to see.\n\n**Commenter 4:** I really don\'t understand why a woman wants to go through your messages with your ex and you think \"yup, this is a great person to start a relationship with.\" You can\'t even wear a watch without her getting jealous or insecure. She dislikes your ex because you ended on good terms, not because she hurt you or broke your heart and she cares about you, but because you don\'t hate her. That\'s wildly immature and toxic. I can\'t imagine this is the only aspect she acts like this in. Are you allowed to have friends of the opposite sex? Go places without her?\n\nI hope these things you\'ve mentioned are isolated incidents, that for some reason your GF just has a weird trigger with your ex. But that usually isn\'t the case.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I get where you’re coming from, but I also understand some\\* insecurity. At the time, my an ex I felt like we were end game, and would be married within a few years. I was probably the happiest I ever was with her it was that sterotype of being in a relationship with your best friend (which I’ve never said to my current partner and I never would). But we moved on as friends and I think it’s fair to be a little concerned that we might have some blurred boundaries. We don’t just to be clear, we had a very clear conversation when we broke up about how we can stay friends - and I value those boundaries. I do have a few friends of the opposite sex, which she doesn’t seem to care about. And I don’t really see any other red flags which is why I’m having a hard time understanding why she’s so upset over just a watch.\n\n**OOP on what kind of his watch is**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** It’s an Omega watch, I’d have to get it out and look at it to remember what kind it is, all I know is it was expensive and way out of my budget hahaha\n\n**OOP on the cost of the watch and his earnings**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** The watch cost thousands of dollars, and I make under $55K which barely gets me by in my city. If my car suddenly needed $1000 worth of work I’d be in a tough spot. Idk didn’t seem weird to me to wonder why someone basically living pay check to paycheck has a fancy watch\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/RjRciKDHGp): **October 5, 2025 (four days later)**\n\nUPDATE: AITAH for wearing the watch my ex gave me\n\nBefore I get to the update I want to thank you guys for the advice, it seems like a lot of you hit the nail on the head with the insecurity posing a problem.\n\nAlso, there is one thing I want to clarify that a lot of people seemed to be incorrectly assuming from my original post. A lot of people are saying I shouldn’t have worn it after she told me she had a problem with it. But that’s just it, she never voiced a problem with the watch before this. She told me I should sell it a few times for the extra money, but never said she had a problem with it. It was always framed as a financial suggestion. Now I will admit I assumed she wasn’t a fan of the watch because of these “suggestions” but I never had a reason to believe it bothered her so deeply and made her feel so insecure to the point she would let it ruin our anniversary. I always figured it bothered her because of its price, and the fact she could never afford to give me a gift like that (which I would never expect her to and don’t care about).\n\nNow, on to the update:\n\nI talked to my father’s friend who used to own a jewelry shop, and he said I could probably get 65-75% of its original value selling it privately but finding a serious buyer might take time. For those who were wondering the watch is an Omega Railmaster, I was told it would cost around $8-9K to buy a similar watch new today which is more than I would have thought. And with the condition mine is in, I could probably get $5-6K if I were to sell it.\n\nSo after work on Friday I asked my girlfriend if we could talk about the watch. I wanted to make sure I understood the problem, and wanted to make sure it didn’t cause any further issues. I said that I felt terrible for upsetting her on our anniversary and that maybe we could go out for a second anniversary date Saturday night to try and make up for it.\n\nI asked if me keeping the watch, but not wearing it on dates would be okay with her. She said she would rather it not even be in the apartment. I asked why. She said that she felt like I was holding onto my ex and that by keeping the watch I was keeping a part of her with me and even if I put it away in the bottom of the closet “she would still be there”. I explained that the watch has no sentimental value to me. It’s not a symbol of my past relationship. It’s just a nice watch, there is no deeper meaning to me. I told her that it seemed like she was looking for a deeper meaning where there was none.\n\nThis is when things started to fall apart and she demanded that I sell the watch because I was denying my feelings for my ex and needed to put her behind me. She started saying she felt I was still loving my ex and that I was holding on to the watch because I wasn’t really over her and that my ex is who I really want to be with because she can shower me in gifts (which she didn’t do for the record).\n\nAll of this couldn’t be further from the truth. If I wanted to get back together with my ex, I had the opportunity. But I said no because I had moved on. Which leads me to the side story from a few years ago when my ex asking for the watch back:\n\nSix months after we broke up (still before I met my current gf) - her company ended up downsizing and she way laid off. She reached out and asked if I wanted to get back together. I said no. I was single, and could have said yes, but I had just moved on, and felt like getting back together (as badly as I wanted to say yes) felt like a step backward, and not to mention her company could recall her to work at any point. I just felt we were better off friends at this point, and I was fully okay with that.\n\nAround the same time she asked for the watch back. She said she was worried about money now that she was laid off and wanted to sell the watch to help cover her bills. I told her no because she didn’t need the couple thousand dollars she’d get for the watch when she had a six figure savings account to bridge the gap between jobs plus she could collect employment insurance. She had never been in a situation where income was uncertain so she was kind of panicking but eventually realized the watch wouldn’t significantly improve her situation.\n\nBack to my current situation.\n\nAfter accusing me of still loving my ex she asked to see my phone, which she hadn’t done since we got together. This surprised me, i understood why she asked the first time since we we had just started dating but I felt like we were past that point and trusted each other now. So I asked her if she thought I loved her and if she thought was cheating and she just said she “didn’t know”. She kept going on that if I loved her I would have gotten rid of the watch on my own. Up until this point the conversation had been not going well, but things were relatively calm - however this is when things started to get volatile.\n\nLong story short, we’ve broken up. I’m not interested in being with someone who doesn’t trust me. She got pretty angry, saying I was just looking for an excuse to go back to my ex after I told her I wanted to break up. I did end up handing over my phone and told her to look for whatever she thought was on it while I packed my bags mostly to prove point that there was nothing to find. She started saying I probably deleted the messages to “cover my tracks” and I realized there’s nothing I could do or say to convince her I was done with my ex. I left to stay with my sister and told her I’d be back on Sunday and that she needed to be moved out by then unless she wanted to take over the lease on her own.\n\nI haven’t heard from her since so I don’t know if she’s gone or not. I’m disappointed this is how things played out. But I think a lot of you were right, she was ruled by her insecurities and had some maturing to do.\n\nP.S. To the shocking number of you suggesting I lie about where the watch came from, I won’t be doing that. I wont (and didn’t) advertise it but if I’m asked I’m not going to lie. That would never cross my mind so thanks for the advice but I won’t be doing that.\n \n**Relevant / Top Comments**\n\n**OOP clarifies the timeline on his relationships with both ex and his GF at the time of the original post**\n\n&gt; **OOP:** Ok, there’s a lot going on so I can see why you’re confusing some things on the timeline and I could have been clearer. My ex and I broke up years ago. Six months after our breakup is when she asked to get back together and asked for the watch back. I said no and we continued being friends. Long after that I met my current gf, who insisted I cut off contact with my ex and wanted to see my messages which I did.\n&gt; \n&gt; So no, my ex didn’t “recently” try to get back together with me. I haven’t spoken to my ex since my gf went through my messages the first time shortly after we got together. I’ve always respected her wishes in that regard.\n\n**Commenter 1:** You should have asked to see her phone. Sounds like she might be projecting her bad behavior on you.\n\nAlso, kinda a dick move to refuse to give the watch back when your ex was freaking out over being laid off. She seems nice, hope she meets someone wonderful.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** She was freaking out but she was not in any kind of financial danger. If I thought she really needed it, I would have given it to her. She was just panicking, she had significant savings, like more than a years salary in savings, plus she had an investment account and I don’t even know how much that was worth. Yeah I could have given it back, but it wouldn’t have made a difference (I think she ended up getting called back to that same company a few months later anyways IIRC)\n\n**Commenter 2:** She’s crazy jealous, but based on how unimportant you say the watch is to you, it’s remarkable how reluctant you are to sell it.\n\n&gt; **OOP:** I’m reluctant to sell it because I’ve never had something nice like this watch. I could sell it but then I’d only be able to buy something cheaper since I wouldn’t get anywhere near what it costs new.\n\n**Commenter 3:** It sounds like you dodged a bullet. Maybe next time date a bit longer before you move in with someone. You\'ve only been dating a year and now your dealing with someone needing to move out.\n\n**Commenter 4:** Holy moly. Honestly, even though this was probably difficult, I think you are so much better off without this person. She clearly has trust issues. Looking at your phone? All these accusations? Totally paranoid.\n\nPlease don’t sell the watch! You can enjoy it as a nice watch without getting all moony over your previous ex girlfriend. You really don’t have to say, hey, see this awesome Omega? An ex got it for me. Obviously, if someone specifically asks, and who does this, really, you can tell the truth (“it was a gift”) but why broadcast it?\n\n(For a little context, my ex husband bought me a really nice watch over 20 years ago, before our first child was born. I still wear it and love it and appreciate it for being a good watch! However, I don’t feel the need to tell anybody at all where any of my watches came from. It kinda seems like a tacky question.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**', 'Choice_Evidence1983', 'BestofRedditorUpdates', 'https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o4fe5p/aitah_for_wearing_the_watch_my_ex_gave_me/', 2132, 292, '2025-10-12 04:02:07', '2025-11-08 01:36:53');

(469, 'reddit', '1ogsmd6', 'My boyfriend single-handedly saved my \"friends\" poorly planned disaster wedding', 'My \"best friend\" of 23 years announced in July she was engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. I honestly didn\'t think our friendship was that close after being out of high school for 18 years, but I said yes. \n\nPlanning started fine, but slowly devolved into chaos. \"S\" is extremely particular, wanting everything for her wedding at her exact specifications, while also having a dime store budget (straight up cheap). She insisted she host the reception in her LDS church gym, while also declaring it \"hideous\" and insisting on ordering full-wall floor to ceiling pipe and draping and ceiling bistro lights. Despite wanting this, she was unwilling to pay for it and also bemoaned the expense.  \n\n I finally stepped back from wedding planning in August because she was too demanding and exhausting. I told her my boyfriend and I would be happy to help her with some of the wedding setup the day prior (so she could order the cheaper pipe and drape package) and left her to her own planning devices. I did throw her a bridal shower last weekend with the help of her cousin. \n\nFast forward 8 weeks...she didn\'t even get her invitations sent out until 3 weeks before the wedding!! She had a 250 person guest list, insisting all of them would come and she decided to not serve actual food, so was only doing cheesecakes and then wedding sheet cake. My boyfriend tried to tell her double dessert was not a good idea but she was ADAMANT. She told us to be at the LDS church at 7 am the day before the wedding. My boyfriend and I were confused why she needed us that early, but figured it would be maybe 4 hours setting up tables and chairs, putting her linens on, putting down centerpieces, and then assembling the pipe and drape and be done. \n\nShe gave me a list of 8 people who were all supposed to be there to setup, but no one except us and her fiance showed up. My boyfriend very quickly and efficiently got all the tables shoved into orientation, I got chairs out. \"S\" bounced around the room in a panic, unable to decide how she wanted to configure tables. Her fiance stood there and watched. Finally, after half an hour of S changing her mind on table placement, my boyfriend said \"Nope! We arent changing it. This orientation is beautiful and you will love it.\" (because he has far better communication skills than me). She was even panicking that the 6 FOOT LONG gifts table wouldn\'t be large enough to hold all her gifts. My boyfriend had to leave the room to not laugh. I assured her, it would be fine.\n\nI thought we were close to being done...WRONG. This woman apparently didn\'t do ANYTHING until THAT DAY. She purchased a bunch of cheap dollar store crap, put it all in a giant tote and left it. She ordered linens from shein and just put them as-is in her box. She didnt open them, check them, iron them...NOTHING. At 830, she opens this box and proceeds to tell us she needs all the leaves cut off the garland because she wants them loose on the tables. She wanted pumpkins glued to her centerpieces, tea lights needed to be opened, batteries installed, she needed 27 tablecloths and table runners ironed, napkins ironed, oh and she needed to FIGURE OUT HER BOUQUET??  \n\nI about died when I saw the sheer lack of prep she had done. My boyfriend was fuming. S was at that point completely incapable of even figuring out where to start. she needed someone to go to Costco to buy 9 cheesecakes, go to the bakery 45 minutes away and pick up the wedding cake and the sheet cake, she needed someone to PURCHASE WEDDING FLOWERS AND ASSEMBLE THEM into a wedding bouquet 😱😱  She wanted me to go to a florist and call her on zoom to show her the flowers while she sat at the venue waiting for the pipe and drape delivery. \n\nMy boyfriend said straight up no. He told her we would go to Costco, we would buy all white flowers and her cheesecakes (she claims she will repay us). She begged us to call on zoom to show her flowers and he said \"we are doing all white. Text us the flowers you hate so we can avoid them. Bye we gotta move fast!\" She tried to ask if we could go to several different ones to find irises and he very kindly told her no. If she wanted irises, she should have ordered flowers. She gets what costco has but \"dont worry, it\'s going to be beautiful and you will love it!\" We then ran the errands- Costco cheesecakes, sauces, flowers, ribbon, floral pins. Her job was to go home and get her iron and board. She said she was going to throw some of the tablecloths in her dryer with a wet towel to try to steam the wrinkles. Perfect. \n\nWe came back at 10:30 am...she hadn\'t left. I don\'t even know what she was doing. My boyfriend and I then spent 2 hours building her a beautiful wedding bouquet. We found a pre-made bouquet that had some nice rust flowers and took a risk and bought it along with white roses. We had enough left over for bridesmaid bouquets too. Trust me when I say...this bouquet he made was GORGEOUS. I would not have been able to pull it off as well as him. He then pre-cut her cheesecakes, we assembled the pipe and drape, while she just freaked out around us. Her mom and sister showed up and I asked them to go to her house and put the linens in the dryer and RETURN WITH HER IRON. So they went to do that but then had to drive 45 minutes away to pick up her wedding cake and sheet cake. I told them to do that but please stop and get the iron. They didn\'t. \n\nShe didn\'t provide any food for us at all, so we left to eat lunch, returned at 1 pm to learn that she actually didn\'t own an iron. They had the wedding cake and a 96 person sheet cake. The wedding cake barely fit in the fridge alongside the cheesecakes. The sheet cake was way too big. We had to just leave it on the counter and hope the buttercream held up overnight. We still had rehearsal dinner to get ready for (paid for by fiances family). We finally just had to leave and I said I would come back to the church after the dinner and help her iron. \n\nDinner took entirely too long. I sent my boyfriend home because I could tell he was exhausted (and he really doesn\'t even know her). Then she hit me with this bombshell: she wasn\'t going to the church to help us iron. She was moving out of her parents house into her fiances apartment that night. Her sister and I tried to tell her that she didn\'t need to do that. Just go on the honeymoon and move the rest of the stuff when she came home. It was her parents house. Her stuff was fine. But she was ADAMANT she HAD to get all her stuff into his apartment that night. I finally left the dinner to go to the church and start ironing and I called my mom and griped about it for 30 minutes. So then MY MOM drove over to help me. \n\nThe rest of the night was me, my mom, S\'s disabled sister and her 80 year old mother ironing linens with my iron, my mom\'s iron, and a cheap steamer we bought at Walmart. She left me with a written list of instructions for how to set up each table to her exact specifications. She left all of the bridesmaids dresses, her petticoat and HER WEDDING DRESS hanging in the church for me to steam and then told us to bring them to her moms house. I didn\'t even leave until 1 am. I was fumed that she didn\'t even get her stupid dress professionally steamed. And after all of that, this chick FORGOT HER BOUQUET IN THE CHURCH FRIDGE after I explicitly told her to bring it home with her. I didn\'t even think about it until 5 am, and I broke down crying at 5 am because I new she was going to call and ask me to drive up to get her bouquet for her and I didn\'t even know when I would have time for that.  \n\nShe called me the next morning asking me to drive 45 minutes to unlock the church for her to get her bouquet. Keep in mind, i was not invited to the wedding because it was at the LDS temple and I am a heathen. Then told me she needed me and my boyfriend to get to the reception church 2 hours early, finish setup, get all the lighting figured out, then manage her food table during the reception- cutting and plating cheesecake and sheet cake, applying caramel or fruit drizzle, bringing it to the tables, keeping water refreshed, etc. She wanted me to do it because \"her family would obviously want to mingle with guests\". She didn\'t plan anything for water dispensers, she didn\'t have a cake tray to even put her turquoise wedding cake on. So I brought my serving ware from my house- our cake tray, glass water dispensers and pitchers. My mom was so pissed on my behalf she un-rsvp\'ed herself to the wedding 🤣 but then she also loaned me her glass wated dispensers too. S also needed us to buy ice for the dispensers, buy and slice lemons...I just stopped caring at that point. She did not get lemon water at her reception. \n\nThe reception was basically me and my boyfriend and 2 of our children acting as unpaid cater waiters. She was 1 hour late to her reception because she didnt plan time for photos outside the temple, and forgot to leave the guest book with me. So I spent an hour trying to entertain angry guests, explaining where the guest book was, explaining where the bride was. No one wanted to eat cheesecake until she arrived. Her dopey fiance left their rings at his house and he arrived 30 minutes after her because he had to drive to get them. At one point, cheesecakes were running low and someone walked up to me and said \"S notice the cheesecake table needs to be refreshed, thanks!\" S\'cuse me WHAT?!\n\nShe then had photos going on outside the reception church- 4 pages of shots she wanted. The photographer did them backwards and instead of starting big and widdling down, she started small and went big so everyone was outside standing around for an hour while the other guests sat inside alone confused. I was outside for the bridesmaid photo while my boyfriend managed the food. She then came back in, cut the cake, and changed to leave. She asked me to box up any remaining cheesecakes and wrap and box her wedding cake and ALL of the leftover sheet cake (which her mother paid for) and bring it out for her to take home with her. No surprise, people didn\'t want double dessert. Of 9 cheesecakes, we had 4 untouched ones leftover, the entire wedding cake (minus 1 slice), and almost the entire sheet cake- basically 90 of 96 slices. Yes...this woman was fully planning on taking home all 4 leftover cheesecakes (that we bought), an entire 96-person sheet cake, AND her wedding cake, somehow fit them in her tiny fridge and hope they would be OK when she got back from her trip in a week. She was not going to share any of this leftover food with her bridal party or family- all of whom single handedly built her reception from the ground up (and paid for the cakes).  \n\nMy boyfriend was incredulous. He was actually cursing in the church he was so mad at her entitlement. He said f*ck no. He took her wedding cake and put it back in its box for her. He didn\'t wrap it in plastic or anything. He took 2 cheesecakes and put them straight into the trunk of our car for us to bring with us to a family dinner tonight. Then he boxed up half of the remaining sheet cake in an extra cake box for me to bring to work this morning to share with people. The remaining sheet cake he boxed up for anyone willing to stay after to take down the wedding. \n\nS was fully out the door on her way to the Anniversary Inn to lose her v card and left me, my boyfriend, her family, and several kind ward members to clean up, take down all the pipe and draping, box up her centerpieces, linens, and then clean the church. We got home around 6 pm Saturday, physically in pain and angry and gave all of our kids full stars for their chore charts (they get a prize at 10 stars so they each got a full 10 stars). \n\nI dont even feel like I attended the wedding. I feel like I catered her wedding against my will. My boyfriend did a bulk majority of the work- assembling the backdrops, tables, breaking it all down, all heavy lifting, making 5 bouquets (which I learned he is excellent at), running the entire catering operation, cleaning the kitchen...I steamed 5 bridesmaid dresses and the wedding dress and ironed 27 tablecloths. Many family members thanked us personally for the work we put in. S\'s mom cried and thanked us for saving the wedding and said she prays for our family and for our health and happiness every morning. The fiances family thanked us and said we did well, and even offered to pay us money, which honestly felt so weird because they 100% should have thrown money at hiring Actual reception staff (or better yet..AN ACTUAL RECEPTION VENUE). S gave us a quick thanks and bounced off. I don\'t expect to hear from her for months. \n\nEverything about her wedding felt so cheap and tacky- dollar tree decorations (plastic lanterns with plastic pumpkins glued on the day before), wrinkly teal shein table cloths and runners, hosted in the \"free\" church gym, complete with basketball hoop. Her wedding cake was teal with orange pumpkins piped on the top. Of her 250 person guest list, about 100 came. There were maybe 7 gifts total on the \"too small\" table and 4 cards (I assume most people used Amazon\'s option to ship to the couple\'s address). My boyfriend said \"it\'s giving Mormon pregnancy wedding\" which we thought was hilarious because we are all 36 and definitely too old for this mid 2000\'s cheap dollar general pinterest board wedding vibe nonsense.

A few visits ago he gave my son brand new unopened AirPods during their visit. This visit he gave my other son a brand new box of air pods with the seal broken which he said was because he wanted to make sure the right product was in the box. \n\nWhen my son went to set up the AirPods his phone gave him a notification that the AirPods can be traced by the owner then it showed a partially concealed email that is the beginning and end of my ex’s email address and he named the device with a name he uses on social media. \n\nWhat are my options? When he’s violated the restraining order in the past it wasn’t taken seriously but that was before the protective order and him being placed on domestic violence probation. My concern is he can just pretend it was a mistake and he was giving him his old AirPods even though they were clearly new and I know that he did this with the intention of tracking the kids.\n\nLocation: California\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you so much to everyone who gave advice and words of encouragement! \n\nThis happened at night after the police station was closed (other than emergency services of course) and we were at an address that he already knows of. I went to Target that same night and got my kid a brand new pair.\n\nThe next morning I filed a police report and gave the pair being tracked to the police. I also emailed the DA who initially handled his case and CC’d the victims advocate, requesting his probation officers information. Once I have a police report I will notify probation.\n\nI notified the social worker and he is no longer allowed to bring gifts to the visit. He can only buy them things infront of the social worker moving forward.\n\nI also want to point out to everyone playing devils advocate and acting like this was an innocent mistake, there is a reason I posted this on legal advice and not parent advice!

Second -- this is going to be fairly long and perhaps unnecessary-context-heavy... it\'s not an urgent request for answers and I hope this will be more interesting than boring even if it is longwinded. :) \n\n\nI will include a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\n\nTo get to the main issue, though: one of my friend\'s coworkers passed away while at work last month -- it was apparently a massive heart attack. He was under 50 so it shocked everyone; more so that it happened literally at his desk in the middle of a shared open plan office. \n\n\nWhile at the wake, my friend\'s (and the deceased\'s) direct boss was talking to some family members and he informally learned that the worker who died had some existing high blood pressure/other health problems that he had been neglecting to treat. Relatives apparently think he would not have died had he been more vigilant with his health. (A moot point and certainly none of his boss or coworkers\' business.)\n\n\nBoss has taken this situation pretty hard (I gather he was extremely freaked out on the day of the incident) and the information that the worker had a preexisting medical condition that could have potentially \"predicted\" what would happen seems to have sparked an idea in his head. \n\n\nOn Friday he announced to the office as a whole (all 20ish of his direct reports, part of a larger company of 250-300 people) that he is giving them until May 1st (specificially \'after tax season\' because he thinks he is being nice and \'unnecessarily accommodating\' of people\'s time) to provide him personally (not HR, not higher execs, just him) an \"updated copy of your full medical history\". \n\n\nAccording to him this means a visit with a PCP/GP \'no less than six months prior to the due date\' and \"fully accounting by the doctor for all at-risk health factors\"and a \"full further accounting of all risk factors in your full medical history\". These are direct quotes -- he gave everyone a memo. The wording in the memo is pretty basic directions in poorly thought out legalese, some of it almost stream-of-consciousness in style. (He is in the habit of dictating to his assistant and gets pretty uptight about her recording exactly what he said and not rewording things to make more sense when he is vague or grammatically confusing, even with his important correspondence.)\n\n\nHe is claiming this policy will allow him to prevent further \"trauma-inducing incidents\" (you know, like a coworker dying very suddenly at his desk a few feet away from you) and honestly seems to be of the opinion that this will *protect* the company from legal harassment in case anyone wants to sue for the trauma of witnessing a death in the workplace. \n\n\nI guess the idea is that if he knows a coworker is likely to die suddenly he can fire them first to prevent anything falling back on him/the company? It doesn\'t seem to make much sense on the surface and I can\'t guess if this is truly his real motivation. (Also, as if a medical history works in a way as to accurately predict sudden deaths of that type... he is clearly not rational on this plan.)\n \n\nHonestly to me it sounds like he was freaked out by witnessing the incident himself, and when the thought crossed his mind to sue the company for his own trauma, it eventually turned into an idea to play it as if he is a good policymaker trying to protect the company from legal trouble (from people like himself). Apparently he\'s been angling for a promotion for years and has in the past already come up with some pretty harebrained schemes to suck up to his own bosses. \n\n\nAnyway, my friend is pretty levelheaded and her immediate instinct is to go to HR on Monday and let them know what\'s going on, but the way she presented the story to me gave me pause. \n\n\nShe described it (casually, over drinks last night) in a manner like \"listen to this completely illegal thing my boss is trying to do!\" It does seem to me like he\'s crossing some dubious legal lines but I\'ve been lurking here long enough to see a lot of people come in with workplace issues they are sure are 100% against the law and it often turns out the answer to \"can they do this?\" is \"yup, totally.\"\n\n\nI think the question of \"is this stupid for my boss to do and should I bring it to HR/higher ups\" is a pretty clear yes, since it doesn\'t have to be illegal for HR to have other reasons to want to shut this down immediately. Still, I\'m curious on the actual legality of what this blowhard is planning. I could speculate that at the very least it seems like it could easily run afoul of the ADA? Thanks in advance for any input!\n\n\ntl;dr \nBoss wants all 20 of his direct reports to hand in their \"full medial history\" to him personally so he can make sure to fire them if they are likely to have a heart attack and die on the job, before they can \"traumatize\" their coworkers.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Feralplatypus**\n\n&gt;The EEOC has a good FAQ on [medical related inquiries in the workplace. ](https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html) I would suggest your friend read this and then go to HR. \n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, this looks very helpful!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What stands out to me immediately is this part: \"Disability-related inquiries and medical examinations of employees must be \"job-related and consistent with business necessity.\"\"\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do you think he could argue that it\'s a business necessity to not, say, disrupt the office with a (supposedly) predictable, \"traumatizing\" death? Or is that too much on the side of opinion to count, legally?\n\n**Feralplatypus**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In my opinion that is FAR too general to meet the \"job related and consistent with business necessity\" prong. Look at it this way, you need to be alive to do any job on earth. Per the EEOC:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; An employer\'s reasonable belief that an employee\'s ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition or that s/he will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition must be based on objective evidence obtained, or reasonably available to the employer, prior to making a disability-related inquiry or requiring a medical examination. Such a belief requires an assessment of the employee and his/her position and cannot be based on general assumptions.\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**OrangePod**\n\n&gt;Is it just me, or does this sound like a lost episode of \"The Office\"?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt; Thanks... now I\'m imagining Michael Scott trying to get away with this and having an epic fight with Toby over it! \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (In all seriousness, though, Michael falls more on the incompetent-but-well-meaning side of the scale than this guy. My friend has been regaling me with awful stories since she started working there a couple of years ago and he is FAR more malicious with his dumb ideas than Michael or even the UK version\'s David Brent.... although imagining an employer thinking they could get away with this in the UK is perhaps even more hilarious.)\n\n**earthboundEclectic**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Can... can you imagine Michael Scott\'s reaction if one of his employees died of a heart attack. It\'s actually pretty sad... I can just picture him sitting alone in his office overlooking the parking lot, just weeping.\n\n**catladydoctor**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;STANLEY! BARACK IS PRESIDENT! BARACK IS PRESIDENT STANLEY!\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/TOrPEAhfKj) **March 24, 2017 (19 days later)**\n\n**UPDATE: \"Complete Medical Records\" Boss**\n\nSince I know my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5xmtvw/massachusetts_boss_wants_everyone_in_office_to/) got posted to BoLA and there were quite a few people in the comments asking for updates... I thought I would provide closure. :)\n\n\nJust got off the phone with my friend a few minutes ago and it is official -- Boss is now Ex-Boss. \n\n\nMy friend did in fact go to HR as she was planning and lay out the situation for them; they seemed concerned and assured her they would look into it, and then she heard no more of it for about a week. Ex-Boss was also suspiciously quiet about the policy during that time period.... until.... last Monday he was not in the office! \n\n\nThere was no explanation given to the office at large but my friend spoke to his assistant and from the information she got from her pieced together that he was in some long, important meetings with corporate HR and that he would then be taking the rest of the week on personal leave.\n\n\nWell, the weekend passed and he didn\'t return; the office was in limbo for the beginning of this week but today someone came down from corporate and announced that Ex-Boss was officially no longer working for the company and that NewCorporateGuy would be serving as their temporary supervisor until a new one was hired.\n\n\nObviously everything largely went on behind-the-scenes but since my friend was the one to blow the whistle to her friend in HR (yes, I did see the comments on the previous thread about how HR is never your friend, lol) she managed to get a couple details at lunch re: the way it all went down.\n\n\nApparently:\n\n* corporate was initially quickly and heavily concerned about Ex-Boss\' scheming because he does have a history of dumb ideas that blew up in his or someone else\'s face, he had in the past always managed to take the heat off himself by throwing someone else under the bus\n\n\n* when local HR came to him to tell him that this new policy was officially Bugfuck Stupid and would cause him and the company far more liability than he could possibly save them from he threw a temper tantrum and insisted that the higher execs would understand what a good idea it was\n\n\n* the meetings with corporate were initially them trying to talk him down and explain why he was wrong; he resisted this strongly and turned them into seminars on why he was actually right\n\n\n* eventually a VP got involved and it was over. ExBoss was not technically fired but he was strongly encouraged to submit his resignation and he will not be getting any reference other than a confirmation that he did in fact work there\n\n\n\nMy friend hasn\'t personally heard anything from the guy since he suddenly disappeared from the office. If he\'s contacted any of her coworkers they didn\'t share it with her. She\'s pretty excited to see the last of him and is hoping her new boss will be less of a moron -- apparently one of her longtime coworkers that has always been a bit of a mentor figure to her is being considered for a promotion internally instead of them hiring someone new as supervisor, so my friend might even materially benefit from this fiasco. :)\n\nAgain, my thanks to everyone who provided me with info and advice and also to those who were just supportive.

Maybe this sad story will contribute to the community.  \n  \nI guess people have different reasons for why they end up using leverage. I don\'t need to be convinced that Bitcoin is here to stay and it will go up, that\'s why I was all-in DCAing. Anything left out of my monthly salary would go into Bitcoin. However, in last 1-2 years my monthly expenses rose significantly, and I was upset about not being able to buy as much Bitcoin as I could in the past. This is what led me to the idea that I can make up for that period in 1-2 leverage trades. It all went downhill from there. Last night I lost EVERYTHING - as of today, my total net worth is not far away from the salary I will receive for this month. Everything I got was wiped out, and I\'m 36 years old already.\n\nThe realization of my age, how much time it took me to get to the point I was at before touching the leverage, imagining all the things this money could fix today if I just spent it, all those feelings and thoughts, are devastating beyond my ability to describe it. The feeling of shame, the feeling of letting down family and relatives. I won\'t ever admit to what has happened to anyone, and I will have to live with this feeling of shame likely for ever. I have seen posts suggesting people are suicidal, I am not, but I very well understand why others may be, going through this horror.\n\nWhat\'s next for me? I\'m trying to convince myself that being 36 and having nothing but a car loan and a few furniture pieces is nothing to worry about, I still have a job and hopefully a few years ahead. I will try to build my cash position and just wait for the cycle end and start deploying cash into BTC when price drops below 90-80k again. Maybe in next 6-7-8 years I will get back to the point I was before I got wiped out. And of course I tell myself I will never touch leverage ever again. This is still a nightmare situation, and I\'m coping hard, but what else I can do? I feel helpless.\n\nIf you are new to Bitcoin and you think you are late, I was there when price hit $4k low in 2020, and was DCAing before and all throughout - today I\'m back to round zero savings at the age of 36, with intention to just get back to buying at whatever prices I will get.\n\nYou can roast me, but this can happen to you, no matter how smart or seasoned you are. One day you may have a random \"valid\" reason to take \"just a little risk\", the next moment you know, you are down to zero. Don\'t trade, don\'t use leverage.

For Night City’s poor, he’s their only option. \n\nFingers is an absolute creep who is implied to be a sexual predator, with his business exploiting the desperate prostitutes and thugs who want some measure of cyber security and can’t afford a more legitimate option. His equipment is defective and will cause issues down the line, forcing people to go back to him. He even sells a brain-damaged woman to a gang for snuff purposes. \n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Fingers initially enforced this trope as well. He was originally the sole purveyor of top-level equipment later in the game, meaning the player had to tolerate him to get the Sandevistan. If you tried attacking him, he would retract the inventory. Eventually, they made it so that you could buy from someone else, putting Fingers on top of players’ shit list. \n\n2) Qyburn (Game of Thrones/ASOIAF)\n\nQyburn was previously a Maester (the educated advisors to noble houses), but he had his chains stripped and was evicted from the Citadel for “experiments”. He defends it saying that the Citadel had no problem dissecting men when they were dead, he just wanted to see what was different when he did it while they were alive.\n\nQyburn is also one of the most effective doctors in Westeros. He successfully amputates Jaime’s gangrenous arm, putting him on the Lannister’s payroll. He further does “something” to Gregor Clegane to “save” him from a vicious poison, at the expense of him becoming a Frankenstein-esque monstrosity. Cersei takes a liking to him and makes him her personal advisor/torturer, a job he excels at. He takes payment in the form of a consistent stream of bodies for his experiments.\n\n3) Yarnaby (Hollow Knight: Silksong\n\nYarnaby was a crazed physician who was evicted from Bellhart for her barbaric treatments. She believes her science is the way to save Pharloom from the Haunting and dismisses everyone who contests it as too simple to understand. Notably, you can see the corpses of her subjects hidden in the floorboards.\n\nHornet is forced to enlist her aid when she gets infected with the Twisted Bud, a parasite implanted in her by a witch that saps her strength. Yarnaby is excited to use her as a test subject for her rusty Extricator. When Hornet goes through the procedure, she screams the longest she ever does through the game. \n\nAfterwards, while Hornet concedes that the procedure did work, she also points out that she barely survived the procedure, and it definitely would have killed a normal bug. Yarnaby refuses to hear the logic of it, and evicts her. \n\n4) Ada Strauss (Fallout: New Vegas)\n\nAda is a traveling merchant in Novac who covers various medical services, such as radiation treatment and addiction removal. She’s conveniently located in the middle of the map, meaning you’re likely to use her several times.\n\nAda is also comically and hopelessly inept with medicine, and regularly mentions botching routine procedures. She uses non-sterile medical supplies, sells drugs on the side, and her own bodyguards tell you she’s not accredited. \n\nFortunately, she works just fine from a gameplay perspective and will hold you over until you get to the New Vegas medical facility.

We know companies usually dodge questions during lawsuits, but we’d rather be up front. \n\nPerplexity believes this is a sad example of what happens when public data becomes a big part of a public company’s business model.  \n\nSelling access to training data is an increasingly important revenue stream for Reddit, especially now that model makers are cutting back on deals with Reddit or walking away completely. (A trend Reddit has acknowledged in recent earnings reports). \n\nSo, why sue Perplexity? Our guess: it’s about a show of force in Reddit’s training data negotiations with Google and OpenAI. (Perplexity doesn’t train foundation models!) \n\nHere’s where we push back. Reddit told the press we ignored them when they asked about licensing. Untrue. Whenever anyone asks us about content licensing, we explain that Perplexity, as an application-layer company, does not train AI models on content. Never has. So it is impossible for us to sign a license agreement to do so. \n\nA year ago, after explaining this, Reddit insisted we pay anyway, despite lawfully accessing Reddit data. Bowing to strong arm tactics just isn’t how we do business. \n\nWhat does Perplexity actually do with Reddit content? We summarize Reddit discussions, and we cite Reddit threads in answers, just like people share links to posts here all the time. Perplexity invented citations in AI for two reasons: so that you can verify the accuracy of the AI-generated answers, and so you can follow the citation to learn more and expand your journey of curiosity.\n\nAnd that’s what people use Perplexity for: journeys of curiosity and learning.  When they visit Reddit to read your content it’s because they want to read it, and they read more than they would have from a Google search. \n\nReddit changed its mind this week on whether they want Perplexity users to find your public content on their journeys of learning. Reddit thinks that’s their right. But it is the opposite of an open internet. \n\nIn any case, we won’t be extorted, and we won’t help Reddit extort Google, even if they’re our (huge) competitor.  Perplexity will play fair, but we won’t cave. And we won’t let bigger companies use us in shell games.  \n\nWe’re here to keep helping people pursue wisdom of any kind, cite our sources, and always have more questions than answers.

Though obviously most conservatives are not fake like the left and we\'ll admit we don\'t really care it\'s not like he didn\'t say anything we already didn\'t know about how he feels, but still Trump\'s response to it was funny and brilliant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am conservative.

So they could see what has been happening. But alas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Conservatives tried the fake politically correct high ground for a long time in response to the left and all it did was embolden them. Finally we have someone who responds in kind. It used to be acceptable to talk this way about conservatives in mainstream society but not the other way around, that lead to a generation of lost support due to social proof. Trump understands this and isn\'t a pansy. The left understands it too which is why they are freaking out about someone who doesn\'t just bend over for them.

(486, 'reddit', '1o18pxg', '30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth', 'Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it\'s your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.\n\n**2025 Partnerships:**\n\n**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**\n\n**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**\n\nThis is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. \n\n**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32\n\n**What’s next?**\n\nPATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*\n\n**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**\n\nBullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. \n\n***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** \n\nIn comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%\n\n*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* \n\nCurrent short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.\n\nSince dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20\'s\n\nIt\'s just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.\n\n[Just like your mom, it\'s desperate to have it\'s gap filled](https://preview.redd.it/bh4w96fiqvtf1.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a8460f055ec3041c6e75824cc2ec74413ff3e6)\n\n**Share ownership:** 76% of shares owned by institutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofp8arvgovtf1.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1de3ea3e0d5a8d125815002c1f75924d255d711\n\n**Ziptrader** (800k subs on youtube) made PATH his #1 pick\n\n**My Position:** November, December, and January calls + shares. Planning to add more, as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks. I\'m using my gambling account, and I got permission from my wife\'s boyfriend to use her account and start another position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be5wwo5povtf1.png?width=371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=085f819ce6466761de9a6600b021287e5ed6ef1d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/821xmxdgpvtf1.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=860e6a18d23502e26764bfb42e0cc59aa0bcd5fe\n\n**TLDR: PATH is an established player in AI and Robotics, has signed major deals with NVDA, openAI, CRM, SNOW, and MSFT, but the stock price has not reflected their potential growth. PT: 50+**\n\n  \n**UPDATE: 10/15/2025**\n\nTrump Tariff Tape Bomb on 10/10/25 Made me take profit on November/December calls. Up $30k\n\nStill Holding January Calls below, and shares.

Seeing a fairly prominent AO3-related account argue that creators have no responsibility to tag at all—and mock readers who care about tagging—feels completely out of touch with how the site actually functions.\n\nAnd what makes this take especially baffling is that it’s coming from an account literally identifies as Dead Dove Do Not Eat. Like?? That tag only functions because of a shared tagging culture. “Dead Dove” is the shorthand we all agreed on to tell people: this is what it says it is, don’t go in expecting anything else. If tagging is just a courtesy, how does that even hold up?\n\nAlso, comparing basic content labeling to a life-threatening allergy is a false equivalency, but not in the way that tweet thinks. The reason people bring up allergies is because it’s about informed consent. You wouldn’t give someone a cookie without telling them there’s peanut butter in it. You shouldn’t post your “romantic fluff” fic without tagging that it includes, say, a surprise noncon flashback or an unexpected kink. Because that’s just basic respect for the people reading your work.\n\nObviously I don’t think authors should be attacked. That’s not what this is about. But I feel like people forget that “don’t like, don’t read” is primarily meant for readers who see all the tags, say “ok 👍,” and then still get mad after reading what was clearly tagged. \n\nThere isn’t really an equal equivalent to reading all the tags in good faith and still stumbling into something upsetting because at that point, the system worked. But when something isn’t tagged and catches someone off guard, that’s not “don’t like, don’t read.” That’s just an author going “don’t warn, don’t care.” Totally different thing imo.', 'Key_ResearcherBurner', 'AO3', 'https://reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1o8aqgb/the_tags_are_just_a_courtesy_take_is_actually/', 2900, 915, '2025-10-16 16:24:46', '2025-11-08 01:36:53'),
