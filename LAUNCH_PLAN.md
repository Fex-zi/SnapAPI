Title: I spent 100+ hours browsing Reddit for customer research, so I built a tool to do it in seconds

Hey r/[subreddit]!

I'm a [your background] and I was validating my SaaS idea by manually browsing Reddit for customer pain points.

After countless hours of searching "frustrated with X" and "alternative to Y" across dozens of subreddits, I realized: this should be automated.

So I built ResearchFlow - a tool that searches Reddit, Hacker News, and Product Hunt for real customer conversations in seconds.

Example: Search "email marketing too expensive" and instantly find 100+ conversations where people are complaining about pricing, missing features, or looking for alternatives.

**What it does:**
• Searches Reddit, HN, Product Hunt simultaneously
• Advanced filters (time range, sorting, specific subreddits)
• Exports results for analysis
• Shows upvotes, comments, engagement metrics

**Free tier available** - 5 searches/month to try it out

Would love your feedback! [link]

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack or my journey building it.
```

**Reddit Post Template #2 (Value First):**
```
Title: Found the top 10 pain points SaaS founders are discussing on Reddit [Free List]

Hey r/[subreddit]!

I built a tool that analyzes Reddit conversations for customer research, so I ran a few searches to see what SaaS founders are struggling with.

Here are the top 10 pain points I found (with real Reddit quotes):

1. [Pain point] - "Quote from actual Reddit post"
2. [Pain point] - "Quote from actual Reddit post"
...

If you want to run your own searches, I built a tool for this: [link]

Hope this helps someone validate their next idea!
```

**Rules for Reddit:**
- Don't be spammy
- Provide value first, promote second
- Respond to every comment
- Be transparent (mention you're the founder)
- Don't post same content to multiple subs same day

---

### 3. Twitter/X Strategy

**Profile Optimization:**
- Bio: "Building ResearchFlow 🔍 | Find customer pain points from Reddit/HN/PH | Indie maker sharing the journey"
- Link: Your landing page
- Pinned tweet: Launch announcement

**Launch Thread Template:**
```
🚀 Just launched ResearchFlow on Product Hunt!

After spending 100+ hours manually browsing Reddit for customer research, I built a tool to do it in seconds.

[Product Hunt link]

Here's what I learned building this 🧵👇

1/ The Problem:
Most founders (including me) build products based on gut feeling instead of real customer conversations.

We guess what people want instead of LISTENING to what they're saying.

2/ The "Aha" Moment:
I was validating a SaaS idea by searching Reddit for "frustrated with [competitor]" and found gold mines of pain points.

But it took HOURS to search multiple subreddits, filter by time, sort by engagement...

3/ The Solution:
Built ResearchFlow to automate this:
• Search Reddit, Hacker News, Product Hunt
• Advanced filters (subreddit, time, sorting)
• Clean results with engagement metrics
• Export for analysis

4/ Tech Stack:
• PHP (yes, in 2025! 😄)
• MySQL
• Reddit API, Algolia HN API, Product Hunt GraphQL
• Clean, fast, no-nonsense UI

5/ Launch Stats (will update throughout day):
• Signups: [X]
• Paying customers: [X]
• Product Hunt rank: #[X]

6/ Special Offer:
50% off Pro plan for first 100 customers 🎁
Code: TWITTER50

Try it free: [link]

7/ Would love your feedback!
What other sources should I add? Twitter? LinkedIn? GitHub discussions?

Reply with your thoughts! 🙏

[End of thread - include Product Hunt link again]
```

**Daily Twitter Tactics:**
- Share interesting findings: "Top pain points found for [niche]"
- Behind-the-scenes: "Just added [feature], here's why..."
- Ask questions: "What's your biggest challenge with customer research?"
- Retweet users who mention you
- Use hashtags: #buildinpublic #indiehackers #SaaS #startups
